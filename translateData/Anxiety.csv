"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share something that happened yesterday. I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee.

Before I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, ""Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.""

But then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, ""It's okay. Let's take a walk.""

We went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.

I always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness, but her kindness showed me otherwise. If you're struggling, please know that there are people who will understand.

"If I didn‚Äôt have such bad anxiety, especially health anxiety, I would probably want to have kids. But the fact that I worry so much already about my existing family, and every ache and pain in my body (mostly because of anxiety making me so tense that it causes a vicious cycle of aches and pains - which then make my anxiety worse)

I start to get depressed thinking that I may lose out on having my own family because of anxiety. But I also can‚Äôt imagine having another human to worry about. 

Anyone else?"
"I'm so anxious that I need it to sleep. Anxiety painful, tremors, chest tightbess, and hard to concentrate. "
"Like really really really actually scared
Anybody else?"
"He said, ""When you get anxious, your amygdala is activated. You can tell yourself that you're okay and even logically understand you are okay, but your amygdala isn't catching up yet. Just remember that you are okay, and it's just your amygdala needing time to adjust."" Basically he's saying that anxiety can persist because our hindbrain and forebrain aren't talking, but it takes time and it will eventually deactivate, so it's important to give ourselves some grace and remember, my amygdala is just aroused right now and it'll go away. Hope this also helps some of you out there."
"A few days ago I made a post about not leaving the house in months. I spoke about how I was going to challenge myself to go somewhere. Guess what‚Ä¶. i went to my local shopping centre today and I went to a few different shops to get different things!

This is huge for me because I haven‚Äôt been to this shopping centre since August 2023, the last time I was here I felt so dizzy that I thought I was going to pass out. This is the furthest I have travelled in ages! I stayed with my mom on the phone to help me distract myself and to ensure that I didn‚Äôt feel alone. I also left the house at around 9.30 am as the shopping centre is normally very calm at this time. I spent about 20 mins in there. 

I just wanted to share my victory with you guys ü•π

Edit: I am so overwhelmed by all of the positivity üò≠ and it truly warms my heart that my post has encouraged others to try to challenge themselves with more exposure! Towards the end of last year I couldn‚Äôt even leave my BED. If I can do it, I‚Äôm almost certain that you can to! I will keep you guys updated when I make my next outing! Thanks everyone üôÇ"

"There are so so so many of us that suffer from anxiety, health anxiety too. This savage beast will literally tear you apart and make you question things about your well being. Because of either panic attacks, 24/7 symptoms, or both, you‚Äôll think you‚Äôre legitimately dying all the time. Not only does this create more symptoms, but you‚Äôll unfortunately never break out of the anxious-symptoms-anxious cycle because of this. If you‚Äôre trying to tough it out or face your anxiety without medication and haven‚Äôt tried it before, my suggestion is that you speak with your doctor and try them out. These medications can be world-changing for some when dosed properly and taken long enough. One of the best ways I‚Äôve found that relieves my health anxiety is positive thinking. Even if you don‚Äôt feel like it, start listing things in your head or out loud what you‚Äôre grateful for. Even if it feels fake, weird, and unauthentic, keep saying things you‚Äôre grateful for, and more than likely your symptoms/worries will fade and eventually the fake gratitude will start to feel real. Unfortunately though, the anxiety can still slip through at times. 
   Start journaling your symptoms, list the date and time. List them over and over, no matter how many times they occur, so that when they happen again months or years from now, you can look at the list and realize you aren‚Äôt dying. The symptoms have never caused you harm. They may be terrifying, but you‚Äôve dealt with them for literal months and years, and they never once have harmed you, nor have those horrifying health fears come to fruition. I won‚Äôt reassure you too much, one day we‚Äôre all going to die, so I can‚Äôt, nor can you, say with absolute certainty that *we aren‚Äôt really dying*. We all technically are. But right now, you are healthy and alive. Even if you aren‚Äôt healthy, you have so many surrounding resources to get you healthy/better. Think about how much worse things could be. Sure, that crippling mental image of you being in a hospital bed that you so extremely hate scares you, but right now you most likely AREN‚ÄôT in that hospital bed, sick and dying. Try to live your life and realize you‚Äôre breathing, alive, and these symptoms have never hurt you. "
People are like why are you anxious? Well there doesn‚Äôt have to be a reason but I still suffer from it on a daily basis I suffer bad symptoms of anxiety like high blood pressure and heart rate and feeling jacked up and nauseous and stuff like that.
"Hi everyone. Male, 31, lifetime sufferer of panic attacks, agoraphobia, and chronic debilitating nausea. Any stress at all or even sometimes for no reason I start feeling incredibly nauseous. In fact a lot of my anxiety revolves around emetophobia.

Anyway, tonight I took the Clonazepam an hour before. Within an hour I felt....normal. I felt like I could conquer the whole world...not in a manic way but in a ""holy shit I just feel....normal""

This got me thinking. How much of my daily chronic and fairly severe nausea is ""just"" my anxiety? I'm on snris for my general anxiety and they work very well. But, this feeling of being healthy is wild to me.

Is there a way to deal with this nausea in other ways than benzos?

I've trried mint, ginger, and even zoffan before to no avail.

Any tips would be amazing. "
"I‚Äôve seen plenty of videos about people thinking that having anxiety is cool and special claiming they have major anxiety just because they don‚Äôt fit in in groups Generalized anxiety disorder is categorized by extreme anxiety and no particular reason for the anxiety. As someone who has been crippled with awful anxiety so much that I have been bed ridden for days and have no idea what I'm anxious about. It's not like your typical anxiety over finances or a job interview. It's a serious debilitating disorder that can cause the quality of ones life to be completely awful. Anxiety disorder isn't just about social anxiety and worrying, it's worry about really dumb stuff that doesn't matter, but you can't help but worry. And you're not realistic about the consequences, you immediately think of the worst possible scenario and consider it as the most likely thing to happen, even if the opposite is true. Because of that, it negatively affects your quality of life - it crushes your ambition, because you're too worried to take risks; it affects relationships because you're not secure enough and you end up with trust issues that cause problems. So having an anxiety disorder isn‚Äôt a flex "

"Possible trigger warning/some tough love‚Ä¶

I just got out of the er for anxiety related symptoms, they did all kinds of bloodwork and everything looks good. Basically as he was wrapping up he asked me ‚Äúwhat is the true reason you came in today‚Äù and I replied with to make sure there isn‚Äôt anything wrong. He replied with ‚Äúthere is something wrong‚Äù. I said that I meant something physically wrong and that I wasn‚Äôt dying. He said ‚ÄúYou are dying, there is something physically wrong with you, anxiety isn‚Äôt just a mental disorder, it‚Äôs very physical. You‚Äôre dying because this is no way to live your life.‚Äù A bit harsh but he seemed to be the type that tells you like it is and this did help me and made me realize that he‚Äôs right, this isn‚Äôt any way to live and worrying about dying and illnesses isn‚Äôt living. I hope this can help someone out there!"
"*Linked an informational video in the comments*

Catastrophizing is when we automatically jump to the absolute worst, most disastrous conclusions about a situation, without being able to fully back it up with facts or trying to see other more helpful and *realistic* perspectives.

It can be very hard to open ourselves up to the idea that not everything is awful, because awful can feel more comforting then uncertainty.

An example could be assuming that just because he is back in office means that everything is going to go totally wrong or we'll all lose our democracy or have a civil war, or people comparing Trump to Hitler (which btw is super disrespectful to those who endured the holocaust)... without looking into stuff like the ways the supreme court and the constitution has levels of control over him, how the state governments set boundaries and protections, past things that we did to get through and prevent future issues. Our countries political system is specifically built in a way that can allow someone to have authoritarian *influence*, but makes it virtually impossible for the president to become a *true* dictator (remember, he's only allowed 8 total years in office so after this term, hes out. That is in the constitution).

 And you know how hes said stuff about overturning amendments in the constitution? That has only happened once in US history, for prohibition, and requires cooperation from the supreme court, the senate, congress and 2/3 of all US states. 

What things have we bounced back from or have improved even despite him being around? Well for one, in 2021 we got the first female vice pres in all of American history, which alone, is monumental and *you* are here for that. *Texas* just got its first openly lgbtqia+ member of congress, and the first transgender woman to ever get elected into congress just got elected. These are already incredible steps that were totally overshadowed by Trump being elected. 

I'm *not* saying this isn't a bad situation for many of us, and I'm not saying it's wrong to feel upset or worried or that you should just ""look on the bright side"", but I'm saying that the future implications most likely will not amount to being the *absolute worst things possible* that the news, our anxiety or our family/friends would lead us to believe.

I definitely recommend just trying to open yourself up to the idea that *maybe, just possibly*... everything won't go absolutely wrong, and looking into the video linked. And being open to challenging your thinking."

"I knew caffeine could affect your anxiety, but I didn't know it could be THAT bad.

So, the story is that I went to a job interview with a CEO of a company, who took me to a fancy coffee place. I was already tense cause of the meeting, but had downed a benzo before it, so I thought I would be ok.

The meeting dragged out for 3 hours, which was a good thing, cause the guy liked me, but he also wanted to buy me different kinds of expensive coffee, and we ended up on 3 cups in a row.
After the 3rd cup I got a really bad heartburn. I am obese and have had reflux issues for years, so I knew it was coming, but it has never been this bad before. My whole chest was on fire.

I struggled to keep conversation while trying to keep my stomach content. Then things started to spin and my anxiety was triggered. Luckily the guy had to go, so we parted ways. At this point the world was rotating and my chest was killing me, so I tried my best at keeping balance and sticking to the walls.

An hour later I returned home, and my anxiety levels kept growing until I entered a full blown panic attack which lasted for another 3 hours. I was hoping it would calm dowm once my wife got home. The heartburn had gotten worse too and my chest pains spread to my shoulders and jaw. I remember my wife coming home and I got up from my seat to greet her. Next thing I know I am in ambulance. My wife told me that I simply collapsed after getting up.

My blood pressure at that time was around 210/114

I was rushed to the ER, where they could find nothing wrong with me other than my blood pressure and the fact that I was in a state of panic.
They spent the next few hours pumping me with antiacids and benzos.
After a high enough dosage, by BP finally began to drop and my panic attack stopped.
All of this lasted 9 hours...

3 f*cking cups of coffee. That's all it took..."
"I guy once told me that when he went out with a girl he puked because of how much anxiety he felt and i also have a lot a anxiety i just never faced any anxious moments so i never had that.

Did anyone else ever puked when forcing yourself in a anxious situation?"
"I wanted to share something that helped me tremendously when it comes to dealing with my anxiety, and something that increased my life satisfaction overall. If nothing, stick around for the funny story at the end.

**Who am I?**   
31 year old male who has had anxiety until the age of 30 - so, most of my life. I didn't know I had it until I started going to therapy.   
I was always the person who everyone told to ""relax"" - but I never know what that meant. I was relaxed *in my perception of myself*. Everyone told me I was always so ""tense"" - in my thinking and ways of life.  
I remember constantly going through tough (read: bad) situations in my mind; for example, in my thoughts, I was perhaps fighting someone or someone was attacking me from the shadows when I was walking in a shady alley (this never happened in real life, but my mind has made it up). I had a lot of thoughts where I argued with people - never to reach a happy ending or an agreement, it always ended with a conflict.

So, unrelated to all of this, I started going to psychotherapy. After a year of going perhaps once or twice a week, I started recognizing more and more what anxiety was. It was sometimes mixed with, what I like to call, depression - but my psychotherapist refuses to accept that, because it's not chronic. And I agree, it was not chronic, but more like daily occurences of emptied out reserves of happy molecules, and lack of ambition. (I also kind of solved this afterwards as well, so I might write a post in the future about that). So I was feeling bad during the day. And of course, had lots of negative thoughts - arguing with people, imagining bad outcomes in my day-to-day job, being rejected by people, and so on.

**What helped?**  
So, at the beginning of the year (2024), I had a lot of anxiety. Both related to work and to my health (incidentaly I had increased my salt intake during one week and my blood pressure suffered, so being the anxious person that I am, I kept imagining it going so bad that I'd die). And I started having some kind of flashes of anxiety - I never had those before, so the situation seemed to have gotten way worse than what it was previously. The flashes were manifested in increased heart rate and tensing up - probably my blood pressure suffered as well - and also an array of negative thoughts. 

So I was laying one night in my bed and was going through the flashes. I couldn't help them whatever I did. I told myself to ""just stop fucking thinking negatively"" and, of course, it didn't help. Then I started to realize something - it never helps anyone to tell them to *stop doing something*, but instead, reframe it &amp; motivate someone to *start doing something*. That was the game changer. I told myself -  
\- Okay, you're arguing with someone in your mind right now. How about you hug them in, instead?   
So I did. And then:  
\- How about they also apologize to you and tell you you've been right all along? (this goes in the direction of the conflict I've been having with people, who in my mind were telling me I'm wrong about some things)  
And I did. And they apologized. 

And I started crying. I've felt like the turntable has happened (had to say it like that, I'm *The Office* fan).   
I was being engulfed with positive emotions, like my body started to heal finally from all the trauma.

Sadly (or luckily, because I was about to learn how to strengthen my positive thinking), another flash of anxiety &amp; negative thoughts came up as I was having these nice thoughts, after such a long time.  
\- No, FUCK you! (I've said to myself)  
I managed to turn them around into something positive again. And more crying ensued. 

From this point on, I learned to start thinking positively in my life. And I found myself SMILING! Constantly!  
*How does that look like?* Well, I imagine goofy stuff which brings me lots of joy. For example, if I was at a pool and I walked by three girls (who by the way ignored me) I thought afterwards how they approached me and told me how nice I look. Or if I ended a call / job meeting which I didn't like how it went, I imagined in my head that it went exactly how I wanted it to go, and that everyone praised me for my contributions.

It didn't matter that this didn't happen (or maybe won't ever happen), and I wasn't delusional. I knew that I was imagining it, and that I cannot always be right, or that I cannot be the prettiest guy in the room and that everyone will like me.   
But in my mind, I was. And, boy, did that change my perspective on life. It manifested some *crazy good shit* into reality just became of my positive framing.

**What I learned from it**  
I learned that I had some unhealed trauma in my life - and you might have guessed it, about being right, about being liked, and so on. So in my mind I started making up situations where I was the prettiest, I was always right  and that I was having a lovely time with everyone - there were no arguments, fights, or things of that sort.

Now I have set up events in my calendar to remind me to think ""happy thoughts"" 2x per week, and for 10 minutes only. I come refreshed out of it. 

Whenever I am feeling bad, if I remember to reframe those feelings, or just think of something good happening to me. 

**Do you want to try it? How will you know if it works for you?**  
Please note, if you try this for yourself and it doesn't work - try to see if, when you shift around your perspective from bad to good, does your mind say: ""No, this can't be right. I cannot be this liked / loved / right / pretty""? If so, CONVINCE IT that it is fucking possible! Your mind will try to stop you at first, because it's been that way for years / decades, it probably  won't allow you to shift your perspective that fast. It might, but you also might need to ""battle it out"".  
You will know it works for you if:  
\- tension starts dropping  
\- you start feeling good throughout your body  
\- you start crying (if unresolved trauma)  
**- you start SMILING** 

I hope this helps at least one person, the way it helped me. Have a nice day, reader!

**Funny story**  
I was having lunch with my parents and I finally had the courage to bring up the topic of anxiety, now that I've learned to recognize it &amp; deal with it. So I asked my dad, who is a very intelligent person, with a PhD, if he has anxiety perhaps, because he is kind of a negative person. This is what he said:   
\- Hey dad, do you think you have anxiety?  
\- Anxiety, what's that? Some modern problem of your generation?  
\- No, it's when you think of negative thoughts all the time. Like thinking about bad scenarios which might happen.  
\- No I don't have it. But yes I do think a lot about negative scenarios because I'm trying to prevent them. For example, I think of all the things that might go bad, so when they actually happen, I am prepared for them. Have you read Sun Tzu and ""The Art of War""? He said that preparation is most of the battle.

*\*queue me thinking how to tell him that this is exactly what anxiety is\**  
  
\- Well, dad, does that mean you're preparing for war in your head constantly, what kind of life is that?

*\*now he stopped to think, which he hasn't done in a long time, since he usually just spews out answers\**

\- Well, heh, maybe. 

By now I think he was embarrassed that anyone actually outwitted him in a sense, because he enjoys winning conversations. But also I think - no, I hope - that he reflected a bit on his life so far."
"Feeling nauseous and sick is mine.

The sensation gets worse when I‚Äôm sick, which I am and it feels horrible, especially during a time when I‚Äôm recovering and get random uncomfortable sensations in my throat and causes me to cough until I gag.

My daughter and I just got home from the movie and I feel like my daughter was Riley. My daughter started puberty this year and is very emotional/sensitive and I think the ending when she was having the anxiety attack just set something off in my 9 year old. The part where Joy helped calm down Anxiety is what made her cry her eyes out. We couldn‚Äôt even stay for the ending it was so bad. I felt terrible and now I really think my daughter is expecting the worst in middle/high school. She just calmed down when we got home. I thought it was a good movie just too much for my daughter and she wanted to see it so bad. 
"Yesterday I woke up normal, Drove into work got breakfast and took my Prozac, within an hour I got an email that I felt changed my whole mentality for the day. I just started to feel off.. felt nauseous, and like I was having trouble breathing, but I maintained. It wasn‚Äôt until 4pm when I got back to the shop I told my buddy I wasn‚Äôt feeling good. We went inside he got me a Gatorade but told my boss I wasn‚Äôt feeling well. By then my entire body was shaking, having trouble standing up, felt shortness of breath, etc. all the typical symptoms I get during a panic attack. My boss suggested calling the ambulance. So they did. 

They took my vitals and all while I was in the office and everything was great, heart rate was 75, Blood oxygen was 98, blood pressure was a little elevated which is typical when I have this issue.. I ended up going to the hospital in the ambulance, I walked out, hopped in. When I got to the hospital I was already feeling better, not great but knew it was cooling off. They took an EKG, no issues with the heart, or lungs. Ended up giving me Atarax (that stuff is AMAZING, btw) and my mom gave me a ride home. 

But god I feel embarrassed. I had 4 people standing over me during a panic attack at work. Get hauled off in an ambulance, all for a panic attack.. granted I have been under an ENORMOUS amount of stress at work from my boss. But I never thought I would be hauled off in an ambulance at work because of this.

Should I feel embarrassed? I feel like I don‚Äôt want to show my face at work again. I‚Äôm fricken 35.. I hate feeling like this. 

tl;dr: feeling off all day, made it until 4am(quitting time) and it hit me, boss ended up calling ambulance, I got sent off with good vitals etc, they gave me atarax, and I went home with a sick note for the next day. Should I feel embarrassed? "
"Ive been seeing this nurse for a couple of years now. She initially put me on sertraline, after me telling her about my social anxiety and rumination. 

Ive done it all. 15 years on and off therapy, citalopram, sertraline, hypnosis, cold water therapy, exposure therapy etc... Nothing seems to have shifted this crazy adrenaline response i get when im anxious. I live a life where im pushing myself out of my comfort zone often. Nothing seems to be working. I must say, when im not anxious im a lot more ballsy and glass half full. So the above has worked in that sense, but nothing for this strong surge of adrenaline that i get when i feel like im the center of attention. My arms and legs go numb, heart races, sweating...

But yeah, she told me that the sertraline is helping my anxiety more than i think. Even though we only catch up 1-2 times a year? and while talking to her today i was visibly shaking like a leaf. As we went through my previous notes nothing had positively changed in my life. Then she tried to convince me to stay on the drug and said how im just going to have to accept that this is who i am and live with the anxiety. So basically shes saying i should give up and carry on taking sertraline which from the start, isn't making me any less anxious.

In the end I told her im stopping the sertraline. Im going to go down a different route as i dont agree with what has been said. It pisses me off because i know for a fact there is light at the end of the tunnel. She could be saying this type of thing to so many people who dont know better. If i was a child and she told me that i was going to have to live life shaking like a leaf and not able to get any words out whenever a stranger talks to me then i would have probably gone down a bad path.

Dont know if im just batshit crazy at this point or if this Nurse is fucking clueless? 

If anyone else has had a similar experience with a mental health nurse, please dont give up. It is absolutely possible to change your brain and subconscious response to things. Yes, i get that Anxiety is a part of life which is healthy...but if it's at a level where its ruining your happiness in day-to-day life, dont let anyone convince you that you will never get past it.

"As someone with anxiety, I often get hit with random, scary thoughts out of nowhere. Like, I‚Äôll be in the kitchen and suddenly imagine grabbing a knife and hurting myself or someone else. It freaks me out.

Or when I‚Äôm driving and stop at a crosswalk, I might think about hitting the gas and running someone over. It scares me so much that I‚Äôll double-check the brakes and gear to make sure everything‚Äôs fine.

Sometimes, if someone‚Äôs crouched down with their back to me, I‚Äôll think about kicking them. These thoughts are super irrational and terrifying at the moment, but they cause a lot of anxiety.

Looking back now, I can see how absurd these thoughts were and even laugh at how ridiculous they sound.

What are some intrusive thoughts you‚Äôve had that seemed terrifying at first but are now funny in hindsight?"
"I often feel that I act like a scared kid. I have this impulse to ask for permission from the ""adults"". When I'm anxious, I make stupid decisions.

"As the title says, I made a telephone appointment with my doctor today to discuss about my meds and referral to a psychiatrist, he hanged up on me the first time he called in and I was confused, then after about 20 minutes he called back, after I said hello he started laughing hysterically, and sounds like he was talking to someone and I had no idea what were they talking about with his thick Jamaican accent, then after about 3 minutes of talking and laughing he finally started talking to me, so he knows that I‚Äôm on the phone the whole time but still talking and laughing, am I overthinking?

"Two days ago I went to the ER because I was having a massive panic attack. My heart rate was above 150 bpm for multiple hours, I was having a very hard time breathing, and my body was shaking and tingling. I am a 22 year old college student. I never really get anxious unless I smoke a lot of weed. However, this time was different. I smoked half a J and immediately became extremely anxious. Neither of my roommates was home and I started freaking out so I eventually made my way to the ER. They gave me an IV and Ativan which brought my heart rate down and calmed me down. I eventually got discharged. However, two days later I just don't feel right. I am super lethargic and have no energy. I feel as if my thoughts aren't there anymore. Has anyone experienced this before? If so, how long does this last? Any advice on how to overcome this would be great. "
"I really, REALLY hate hearing my name being called out, or just being brought up in a conversation on the phone. And what makes it even worse is that when it's the full name is mentioned, even if it was in a friendly tone.

"I don't even know where to begin, I'm so upset and hurt. I found this out through one of his instagram posts today and saw that two other people in our friend group got invited and were even his groomsmen.

  
I thought we were good friends. I guess I wasn't his good friend. 

  
I feel like I am everybody's third choice- if it's not someone else, then it's someone other. If it's not someone other, then it's me. Seeing this just ripped wide open multiple scars.

  
Shoot, I'm really in a bad spot mentally. This happens too often. What's wrong with me? I know I'm a good person and a friendly person. I wouldn't hurt anybody. I‚Äôm so upset"
"I would want to be one. To have zero adrenaline if that is possible. To be afraid of nothing. Stonecold in every situation. You know you have to run when you see a tiger. No need to get all excited about it.

No more heart palpitations. No more nervous feelings. No more weird sensations. No more anticipation for social events, or when there is an apointment for something.

I want to become like an action hero in the movies. Taking on anything in life with zero nervousness, tension or excitement. Just get things done because they need to get done without unnecessary emotions.

Is there any way to become like this? Medication? Meditation? A surgery? A life experience? What is needed?

"The energy that gets consumed with anxiety is massive. Imagine if you could control your anxiety and pour all this energy into productive activities.

From the second they wake up they are in a fight or flight mode. Even though they could seem normal from the outside. They‚Äôre actually in consistent battles for years.

Only people with anxiety will understand this. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Yes, benzos can be addictive.

Yes, benzos can absolutely ruin your life if you abuse them.

Yes, benzos can have side effects.

But there are millions of people who responsibly use benzos to treat anxiety, panic attacks, etc and significantly benefit from them (myself included) I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts here about people claiming to have taken one benzo and having a massive reaction from them or some equally crazy story about someone taking like 5mg every time. All it does is promote fear and scare people who could benefit from them.especially ones who tried everymed under the sun and nothing worked except benzos.

I‚Äôm not a proponent of putting anyone on benzos unless they are extremely disciplined about it and don‚Äôt have any addictive tendencies and am aware of the dangers but please stop the fear mongering."

"Whenever I have stress of any kind, I feel full even if I haven't eaten in hours. Sometimes I feel nauseous when anxious.

Or maybe something that can help me get rid of any kind of emotion that I am feeling at the moment?"
"Exposure therapy for the win!!!!

So I‚Äôve been battling with agoraphobia for a little over a year now and I spent 7 months without leaving the house up until July this year. Since July I‚Äôve been challenging myself and it hasn‚Äôt been the easiest but I‚Äôve been doing okay. After challenging myself to go out my next objective was getting on public transport. 

Today I went to my first college lecture this year 8km away from home, I got an Uber just because I knew I was challenging myself a lot. I met with some course mates and hour prior to discuss our group project and then I sat through an entire two hour lecture üòÜ and guess what I challenged myself to get the bus home which is a 45 minute journey on one of the busiest buses in my city as it goes through the airport‚Ä¶ and I did it!

This is monumental for me because this is the furthest I  have travelled since December, this is my first time on the bus since August 2023, and I sat on the bus for a whole 45 minutes!

I am finally learning that I am so much more capable of conquering challenges and that anxiety is truly a liar.  I really hope that this is the start of something amazing!"
Just that. 
"I‚Äôve tried every medication under the sun, and thousands of non med things, but 
Nothing works like a benzo does. It‚Äôs arguably the only thing that makes me feel any sense of normal.

This is just so fucking sad. I wish I was born in the future when we have figured this thing out and can make a benzo that you can safely take everyday so people like me can actually be a functioning human in the world.

I was prescribed klonopin for 5 years when I was 17-22. I was strict with using it only sparingly for the first years but my anxiety is so severe I ended up taking it more often and eventually had to withdrawl from it which was such a morbid disgusting experience.

I said I‚Äôd never do them again because they literally show me such a calm beautiful side of life that I know is too good to be true. Being normal and chill is too good to be true. 

But tonight, after years of not taking a benzo, I took an Ativan, I‚Äôm on it right now. I literally just feel normal. I‚Äôm not high at all, I‚Äôm not anything. I‚Äôm just sitting here and I feel like I can just exist. 

I‚Äôve tried all the ‚Äúbenzo alternatives‚Äù supplements and hydroxyzine and propranolol lyrica you name it, but like I said, a benzo is just different.

Quick! You are freed from the anguish of anxiety for 24 hours. How do you spend this wonderful day?
"The past 7 weeks I have been taking vitamin D supplements because I‚Äôm pregnant, the major side effect of that is anxiety is GONE. For as long as I remember no matter how well my life was going, I woke up every morning feeling dread or a pit in my stomach. I exercised , went to therapy did everything but test my bloods for deficiencies apparently. Then recently I realized despite having a rocky start to my pregnancy ( I got a bad tooth infection and had to have the tooth pulled and was in agony for weeks) I felt ‚Äònormal‚Äô. Like I would feel bad but nothing lingered . The dreadful pit in my stomach was gone. I‚Äôm reacting what I consider is normal to both good and bad news. I never ever thought I would get to feel like this and the best part is I had completely no idea this would happen. It happened and then I had to check and see what it is that had changed in my life to cause such a drastic shift and vitamin D was the only thing I could point to. Additionally I‚Äòm black and grew up in cold and rainy Ireland then moved to Spain 2 years ago and already I had such a difference in my anxiety since I moved here , it wasn‚Äôt as bad as when I lived in Ireland and Germany but I still had it. Melanin blocks the sun so dark skin people need a lot more sun to get healthy vitamin D anyway so I saw an improvement from getting some sun vs none but I needed the supplements I guess to drive it home.

I‚Äôm so happy and grateful. If you are reading this, have dark skin or at risk of low vitamin D please go get checked. I can‚Äôt believe I suffered for so long."
"I've been learning more and more about how having low iron, ferritin, b12, and folate can all cause anxiety symptoms. I've also noticed that when I'm my most anxious, my levels are low. 

Just wanted to put it out there because this came as a surprise and when I manage my deficiencies I find that I don't get panic attacks and my anxiety feels much much better. I even stopped taking Sertraline and didn't have any anxiety episodes as bad as I used to once I got my levels under control.

Right now my levels are really low again and once again my anxiety is increasing. Hopefully this helps a few of you to inquire on these tests with your primary doc."
"Yes, they're overprescribed still in some places and they used to be overprescribed a LOT but they're still incredibly useful medications.

My psych office will not prescribe them under *any* circumstances. The only anti-anxiety medication they give is hydroxyzine which is helpful for sleep and when I'm just on edge but if I'm deep in the panic throes they do nothing. My chest currently feels like its about to explode and I feel like there's nothing I can do but wait and hope it passes.

My old doctor gave me Klonopin under *very* strict controls (they were take as needed but I only got 10 a month and she would not give me any more until I finished those 10) and I almost never used them because I'm terrified of addiction, my best friend died ten years ago from an overdose so I'm extremely careful about this stuff? But the handful of times I did need it it was a lifesaver. (I actually think I still have a handful of them in a bottle somewhere because I never finished them but I'm sure they're ineffective by now it's been like 6 years)

I'm just frustrated. I hate being treated as drug-seeking for needing more help. I'm super lucky I've been diagnosed ADHD since I was a teenager or else I'm sure I'd suffer from this w/ my stimulants too."
Mine is the chest crushing feeling at the moment.
"i was just in kohls and getting ready to try something on, i wasnt feeling well so i sat my items down on a table outside the fitting room so i could reach into my pocket and get a mint. i had to lift out my keys/pepper spray to get the mint, and when i was putting my keys back in my front pocket a male worker yelled from like 4 car lengths away ""HEY WE DON'T DO THAT, NUH UH"" and I've talked to him before so i thought he was joking. i said huh it's my keys. i started freaking out and getting dizzy so i walked over to him and i was like i promise im not stealing look and i emptied my pockets and said these are my keys. he was like its fine but it looks very suspicious.

i kept apologizing over and over.i have such a fear of this happening that i wont even bring my purse into stores anymore. i told him i used to put my keys in my purse but that i feel weird bringing a purse in stores because im scared of looking suspicious. and he smarted me off and said something like yeah, it does look very suspicious. i started crying and put all the clothes back that i was going to try on. im in my car now and i cant stop crying. i would never steal anything ever. i'm still shaking im so upset i feel like such an idiot. idk if i can ever go in that store again. i live in a small town and it was my favorite. there were so many people in there when it happened .im so upset"
"This question just popped up in my head and I wanted to know your opinions, which symptom of anxiety do you have that you hate the most? For me it's my throat being tight, it feels like someone is choking me and I can't breathe and swallow well.

"I work from home, and I take advantage of that by waking up about 5 minutes before work, rolling out of bed and going straight to it. Because I always wake up in the morning in a pit of dread as soon as my brain is aware I'm conscious. Goes straight from sleepy comfort to ""oh god we're awake, here's all the shit you have to be anxious about RIGHT NOW"". Meds help but they don't kick in for an hour or so so I *have* to get straight to work or else I will have a panic attack first thing in the morning every morning.

Anyone else wake up super anxious every day and how do you handle it? I know it gets better after an hour or so but it also makes me afraid to go to bed at night knowing how bad the morning will be which is contributing to my chronic sleep issues."

"I have a theory that the oldest child, specially when there is an age gap of 2‚Äì5 years between said child and their younger sibling, makes the oldest child develop phobias in their childhood and Anxiety Disorder later in life. 

The oldest child is always the most cared and most protected child of a couple. When the second child is born in a time when the oldest child is growing physically and mentally, being more aware of their surroundings and being guided by their curiosity, the child stops having that attention and protection from their parents. They become more independent and in order to protect themselves from the environment, the brain used to being protected and not having to worry about much, starts triggering the fight or flight response more often. Phobias and other fears start appearing that can later lead to an Anxiety Disorder."

Like, that doesn't make me feel better, I want my thought processes to be challenged, I want to be wrong about the world falling apart and have evidence that I'm wrong and that Im just an idiot whose mind is paranoid over spilled milk; I don't want my darkest fears to be validated"

"Hi everyone. I know some might say the title is silly. I‚Äôm currently in one a of hell dark era, and anxiety is of course through the roof.

But I found myself that little trick in the title and it‚Äôs working great. Just move slower. Walk slower. Anything you do, do it like 20%-30% slower than you would usually do. Brushing your teeth, preparing a coffee, buy groceries‚Ä¶ if you think about doing it slowly you get your mind focused on it, like instantly.

Think about japanese tea ceremony, something like that. Pace down and be conscious of every movement.

As said, it may sound silly and may not work for everyone, but may be worth a try. Hope you all do great!"
"I just started propranolol today, 10mg, and it feels like MAGIC, after years of being on SSRIs/meditation/relaxation/CBT/ACT/etc. My heart rate moderated, my intense anxiety body sensations like chills, tremors, went away. I estimate now that 90% of my severe work anxiety was caused by fear to adrenaline-triggered body sensations, and only 10% was triggered by my thoughts. 

I feel I finally have a fighting chance. CBT works better. Breathing works better. SSRIs keep doing their thing. I almost took benzos out of desperation‚Ä¶.maybe I don‚Äôt need them.

It is almost impossible to beat adrenaline when it‚Äôs working incorrectly and overwhelmingly. Propranolol is massively helping. It cuts the mind &gt; body &gt; mind vicious cycle, and allows me to do the mental work. 

It is insulting and enraging that this beta blocker is not prescribed more to eligible patients. A lot of suffering can be avoided. ‚ÄúOnly‚Äù reducing the physical symptoms can be a massive win. I cannot understand how doctors don‚Äôt get that breaking the feedback loop between mind and body CAN allow the patient to better tackle the root cause of their anxiety.

If you‚Äôre in the fence, my advice is take the propranolol. Try it on a low dose. Consult your doctor if needed. It‚Äôs safe, and might also give you a fighting chance against the monster of chronic anxiety.

Edit: thank your /r/Anxiety community because I found out about propranolol because of you."

thank you guys for sharing didn‚Äôt expect it to blow up this much, but yeah something to add on i also hate the fact that my anxiety has to make everything in a specific order, i can‚Äôt even get out of bed until i tell myself what i‚Äôm doing in what order and even then i still dk."

An email was sent around informing everyone I work with of the breach.
I‚Äôve been assured this is a human error and they do not want me to be upset. I just need to learn from this. 
The issue is, I don‚Äôt deal with situations like this very well. It‚Äôs made me very sick and have a panic attack. I‚Äôve had to take the rest of the day off work, they seem very concerned about me. I‚Äôm too upset to speak with anyone right now and I believe they are arranging for a staff counsellor to talk with me.

I feel like that's the best way to die, but that's also bad because you never really know when it could happen. That's what scares me. You never know when you'll die.

I can't sleep now because of this. It's currently 2am and I have school in the morning. Finals are starting soon and I know I need sleep. But this thought won't leave my brain. It's making me afraid to sleep. Anyone else have these thoughts? How do you make them stop?

Edit: I'm going to add something. I'm scared of death and what might be on the other side. But I kinda just hope that I see my family when I die . I don't really care what else there is. I mainly just want to see my grandpas because they passed when I was young and I want to know them. What I really am afraid of is the feeling of dying. Like what does it feel like as you're dying?

Today, despite begging my mom to come along (she hyped me up and said I only have to buy one thing I got this) i went into the store on my own to buy one box of hair dye.

My hair right now gave me anxiety, as I kind of have a bleach fail going on, yellow roots, green tips. But I didn't expect anyone to really care, and I fought against my brain and went outside despite feeling silly.

Well someone DID care, apparently. As I was anxiously waiting to hand the cashier the money and run out as fast as i can, she loudly told me I'm just ""going to keep making my awful hair look even worse"" if i keep buying box dye and i ""should invest in going to an actual hairdresser to fix that mess"".

There were so many people behind me and I felt my face going bright red as I was just left speechless. I didn't even defend myself or say anything I was just quiet and said ""we'll see"" before bursting into tears in the car.

My heart right now must be at +140 bpm. Impending doom feeling, sweating a lot, the heat is horrible outside which worsens things a lot. 

I took 1mg of klonopin in the early morning, im considering taking more but Im scared of getting dependant to this medicine. 

This sucks so much, I really dont have anyone to talk to. If I call friends they must be with their families, its saturday so I dont want to bother anyone. I ghosted my therapist bc it wasnt working anymore and my psychiatrist answers with like a day late. I feel so alone despite not being alone. Im terrified. 

Everybody is laughing and having a great time outside and I dont want to go to the ER for the 200th time just to tell me they cant do anything for me and to call my psychiatrist. I hate this. I hate it so much.

"(f18) within about the past 6 months i've felt the most lazy and unmotivated i've ever felt in my life. i hate going to work. it feels like the biggest chore of my life and i think about leaving as soon as i walk in. when i get off work, all i do is lay down and scroll on my phone for a bit before going to bed. on my off days i lay down all day even if i know i have stuff i could be doing. i don't have any hobbies or anything, a day off for me literally consists of waking up, masturbating, taking a shower/hygiene, and then laying back down and scrolling on my phone til it's time for bed. i used to be a really happy girl who enjoyed going out and doing things but i don't even enjoy being out anymore. when i'm at work/out all i do is think about laying down. it's so sad"
"My girlfriend has severe anxiety. I never knew how truly bad it was until recently when she had to go to the ER for pain. She always told me she hates going to the doctor and has refused when I‚Äôve brought medical care up in the past. While I believed her, acknowledging her fear, I didn‚Äôt quite grasp the situation.

We got to the hospital and routine care was fine (checking pulse, weight etc) but they wanted to do blood work. I don‚Äôt think the er nurses were prepared for her in the slightest. I think the weight of the term anxiety wasn‚Äôt taken as seriously with the nurses. When I originally heard she had anxiety I just figured it was just an uncomfortable experience for her. It‚Äôs chronic and I don‚Äôt believe the nurses nor I was prepared for it or knew how to deal with it.

They denied her request for numbing cream three times in a demeaning manner. After getting the band on for blood, she went into a full blown panic, bawling, saying she couldn‚Äôt do it and ripped the prep items for taking her blood off.

After rotating through 3 or so nurses pretty much repeating she needed blood taken (all not understanding the situation), a doctor came in. She pretty much requested blood also in which my girlfriend effectively told her she‚Äôd rather die and if she took it she may get hit. The doctor, fairly not liking this questioned her about it, I‚Äôm assuming to see if she was serious or not. She was. Eventually that doctor left.

After finally getting an anxiety med and numbing cream they were able to get blood. She still cried and was somewhat unruly, but it was not nearly as bad. She was meant to get imaging done, so there was an IV connection left in her arm. After maybe an hr, for some reason, it started burning excruciatingly hot to the point she was again bawling. It had to be removed.

At this point we were at the hospital for, I want to say, 5-6 hours. Another nurse comes in says she needs the cannula (IV connection port) reinserted into a vein, the one that had to be removed prior, for imaging. She had numbing cream applied, but was then left for another hr. The anxiety med wore off. When another nurse attempted to reinsert it, my girlfriend went into a panic, started bawling, thrashing and kicking (not meaning to or hitting the nurse as far as I know). The nurse was pissed which I get. No one wants to get hurt helping a patient, but I also get my girlfriend‚Äôs situation. Regardless, my girlfriend pretty much threw every ~~slur~~ cuss word in the book at this nurse which was unexpected and embarrassing.

We decided that was it, we tried and we went home without getting pretty much anything done.

As someone who had just really experienced what she meant by fear of doctors first hand, I‚Äôm a bit shook. I love my girlfriend deeply and don‚Äôt view this as a make or break‚Ä¶but something needs to be done. She denies prescription medication for her anxiety which isn‚Äôt exactly reassuring. Aside from the doctor, this type of behavior does not happen, at least from what I‚Äôve seen thus far. Cbd and edibles do seem to help her. Her aversion to medical care is honestly frightening, especially if we plan to start a family. I‚Äôm kind of just hoping someone out there has some insight."
"I have had severe anxiety since childhood, and I literally don‚Äôt remember there was time i was calm and happy, I always was anxious,terrified,depressed and scared of everything but maaaan, Prozac changed my life.
I was terrified to take meds for my unending anxiety but I eventually did took prozac and i‚Äôm living my best life right now and I didn‚Äôt know people experience life in a calming,fun way. Anyone who‚Äôs needs to be medicated and scared DONT HESITATE THAT, your life is worth living. This is only an advice popped  to my head before i go to sleepüíó."
"I know there is a lot of stigma about benzos and I have posted several times about this. But, hey! Some of us need them! Just like some people need insuline, or beta blockers for high blood pressure.

If you are like me that has tried therapy, supplements, lifestyle changes and everything else, for several years and you still live in your room with crippling anxiety, stop that, and seek for medication and START ENJOYING YOUR LIFE NOW! TODAY! 

Your time is now! You have to live now!

Or do you prefer to be bedridden for 20, 40 or more years just because most people are against medication? 

Everyone sees people smoking weed, drinking dozens of beers everyday and it is OK, but if you take a benzo, that's wrong! Come on! 

Just like benzos, weed and alcohol has long term side effects. Everything does! Even the water that you drink and the air that you breath is full of dangerous chemicals. 

If you worry about what will happen in 20 or 40 years, you will never enjoy your life.

My mom and several people in my family have taken benzos and SSRIs for 40 or more years and they are now 65 - 90 years old and completely healthy beacause they have never abused them. 

If you need benzos everyday to enjoy your life! Do it! Just don't abuse them. 

If you need SSRIs, go and take them. You have to start living now because you don't know if you have 2, 3 or 50 years left, so you better live them instead of being inside your houses, with nausea, intrusive thoughts, and depressed. 

You can be a normal person, you can get a job, you can study a carrer. Just do what MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER, and don't care about the others, and focus only on the PRESENT. 

I hope everyone here feels better just as I have been feeling lately since I accepted that I need medication. I don't care if I get side effects in 30 or 40 years. I will deal with them later if I get any. 

My time is now, and I prefer to live the time I have left full of happiness and being a functional person, instead of spending decades in isolation and suffering just because there is a stigma about medication.

"i am terrified of what comes after death. it keeps me up at night, i can never find peace and am never mentally comfortable because i‚Äôm constantly thinking about it. i have nausea when i try to sleep and i sometimes wake up in the middle of a panic attack (or on the verge of one) because i‚Äôm so scared.

does anyone else feel the same?"
"I am on the average end of anxiety when compared to most people and vow to never touch hardcore ssri‚Äôs, Xanax, etc. Instead I rely on supplements like theanine, NAC and magnesium plus plenty of water to keep it at bay. Of course life happens and I need anxiety inducers like caffeine and nicotine to stay functional, and I haven‚Äôt had the energy or time to workout. It‚Äôs a struggle because it gives me palpitations/pounding headaches on top of a low dose panic attack. Just today I decided to jumpstart a possible new routine by wrecking myself with 100 walking lunges and I have to say I feel incredibly calm afterwards. I know it‚Äôs a no brainer that these endorphins can be anxiolytic but I just thought I should share, sometimes we‚Äôre always trying to chase that new miracle cure/stack when more often than not the best solutions are always in the basics"
"I know when people are anxious, they tend to overeat or stress-eat. For me, I literally have no appetite at all and will feel incredibly nauseous and more stressed if I eat, even broth. The only thing that helps is large amounts of water. (This feeling could go on for weeks even, but I still do eat) Is this feeling normal? Thank you! 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who took the time to share your thoughts and personal experiences. It's amazing how sharing our thoughts and feelings can create such a strong sense of connection and understanding. I genuinely hope that each of you finds comfort, healing, and peace with your struggles. This anxiety, it's something we all experience in different yet similar ways, and this thread really highlights this shared human experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Plus, everyone on this sub is so nice. Thank you all for being so gracious!"

"Hi everyone. I recently met a psychiatrist who finally understood the severity of my anxiety. He has prescribed me effexor in combination with mirtazapine. For the first time in 24 years I feel calm, obsessive ruminating intrusive thoughts have been reduced 95%. I'm now feeling extremely depressed and low thinking about how difficult my life has been these last 24 years. I was experiencing full blown panic attacks day after day for 24 years. Just wondering if anyone can relate"
"Today I taught my monthly crafting workshop. I‚Äôve taught over a dozen of these courses and they usually consist of about 15-18 really excited and awesome students who are paying customers and excited to learn. From me! 

Naturally I‚Äôm a little nervous during introduction but become much more comfortable as class goes on. But today I had a full on freak out in front of my entire class. 

As I was about 2 minutes in, suddenly my heart began to race, I became disoriented and could barely speak. I could feel the walls closing in on me and felt like I was about to pass out as my entire class watched all of the confidence leave my body. I had to stop and visibly compose myself. I felt like I was going to pass out and wanted to run away and hide, and come back out when I was calm.

I apologized to my class, was honest about being abnormally nervous today and really generally anxious. I kept my head down with shame as I could barely muster the courage to face them all while I spiraled into the abyss. After what felt like an eternity I was able to compose myself and carry on with class.

Class actually recovered just fine. Everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves and were excited to talk with me and take photos after class. But I cannot help but feel mortified. I had lots of new students, my coworker was there, my hair dresser was present, family friends I haven‚Äôt seen in years all came to support and take my class. I feel like I failed them and am terrified this will happen again for nexts months workshop.

It‚Äôs important to note my anxiety levels in general have been at an all time high over the last few weeks. I rarely get acne but my skin is breaking out in such a manner that I really feel it‚Äôs starting to take a toll on me physically. I am quite overworked and spread thin these days. Which I also shared with class during my episode and now I feel stupid for telling them that. Like why?!

I want to forget this ever happened! I hope being vulnerable humanized me but I am absolutely humiliated. "

"I‚Äôve been sober from any cannabis (even C B D) products since January 20th this year and my anxiety has cut down 75%. I no longer feel anxious on a day to day basis. Even since going through a hard break up since then, my anxiety has been SO MUCH better. I consumed everyday for 2+ years before I had a bad panic attack after smoking one night. After that panic  attack things were never the same, I would get them on the regular, and every time I would consume via smoking or edibles I would be a ball of anxiety, literally laying in bed thinking about my parents dying, all these horrible intrusive thoughts, I would be crying, shaking, literally sprilling everytime after I would use. It was horrible, but I literally couldn‚Äôt stop. I was so afraid of being alone with my thoughts that I couldn‚Äôt stop smoking. Well January 20th after my boyfriend I loved so much ended things, I finally said enough is enough and I stopped. And since then, even going through really hard times, even travelling abroad by myself, my anxiety is so quiet. I do have times I‚Äôm anxious like if I think I‚Äôm going to miss my train or flight, but hour to hour day to day I‚Äôm SO MUCH BETTER. If you‚Äôre a heavy consumer of weed I definitely would recommend trying to stop and see how you feel! It worked for me.

"I‚Äôve tried so many of them (starting with box breathing, which seems to be most commonly used for anxiety) and they don‚Äôt help. If anything, focusing on my breathing makes me hyper aware of how long I am holding my breath and my anticipatory anxiety kicks in.

"#Long post warning. TL;DR I had a nightmare edible trip a few years ago and it seems to have permanently affected the way I react to weed and increased my daily general anxiety. Looking for similar experiences, hoping for some explanation or a happy ending.


Title says it all. This incident happened about two years ago. Here's what I can remember from the trip:

Background: I smoked a lot on and off since I was in my late teens (now in my 30s). Had a brief period of hard drug use, then my wife helped me clean up my act and my life has been pretty sweet and my overall anxiety had been quite low - for the past few years, I haven't had anything stronger than a beer and some weed and generally that was fine until this incident happened. I never, ever in my life had any sort of weed-induced anxiety save for one time in high school when we got chased by the cops through a park while stoned, but an hour later we were just laughing about the experience. I do have general and social anxiety disorder but weed never amplified that, in fact it was always the opposite where weed would calm me down and mellow me out. It was like a miracle drug. I never got stuck in my own head or anything like that until this happened. This is important to note: for the months leading up to this incident, I stopped smoking daily to focus on work, usually only getting stoned on the weekends. So my tolerance had dropped.


Drove into the city to see a movie. Hanging around outside beforehand, I took two edibles 20 minutes apart, each of which contained roughly 2g of some dispensary shit that had been mailed in to our state. They were peanut butter firecrackers. I completely fucked up the dosage and accidentally put in about ten times as much as I intended (I'm bad at math). That was my first mistake. I did not take into account the fact that I had a lower tolerance and just wanted to get ripped. So I gobbled them down and the die was cast. Someone I talked to estimated that I ingested at least 800mg of TCH. For reference, I think the dosage of most edibles these days for normal people hover around 10mg.

About 35 min later, we were sitting in the theater when the first one kicked in almost all at once. For about 3 minutes, I was giggling and feeling good. Then I realized I was way more stoned than I expected, it was kicking in too fast, my heart was thumping, and the second one hadn't kicked in yet. So the anticipation of how much higher I was about to get started to make me uncomfortable. My only thought was the second one hasn't kicked in yet, it hasn't kicked in yet, holy shit this is going to be a lot. My hands began to tingle and I got lightheaded and all of a sudden my heartbeat and breathing seemed way too loud to be normal.

I tried to calm myself by telling myself that I was in a movie theater and all I had to do was sit and distract myself with the movie, and that was when the paranoia started. I felt like everyone behind us was watching me. I started breathing really quickly and I was just about to lean over and tell my wife when the second one kicked in.

Just like the first one, the second edible hit me in the head all at once like a hammer. I blasted off. For a moment, all I could do was grip the arm rests as tightly as I could and wheeze through my nose, trying to control my breathing. I started drooling and sort of foaming at the mouth like a dog. My vision exploded into a kaleidoscope of color but they weren't pleasant colors, they were hostile and unnatural alien ones that only served to reinforce the idea that I was not in a comfortable and natural place. I felt like a space monkey locked in some hateful alien zoo. The small rounded lights on the walkways seemed to me like eyes which were staring furiously at me. I lost the ability to hear things and all I could sense out of my ears was a low, deep evil droning like a ship's foghorn. I covered my ears but it didn't help so I started shaking my head furiously, whispering no, no, no. At this point my wife looked over at me to see wtf I was doing and she saw that I was tripping out. She whispered something to me but I couldn't hear her because I had lost my ability to hear or discern human words. Her voice made no sounds but her teeth scared the shit out of me. They looked like the angry teeth of a shark. She rubbed my hand and noticed I was sweating bullets.

This was the last point where I noticed anything about the movie. I sat in there for 20 or so more minutes but despite watching the screen I had no idea what was happening and I might as well been like the dude from Clockwork Orange who was brainwashed with his eyes taped open. Right after the second one kicked in, I got stuck in a mental thought loop where I could not perceive any conscious thought other than this is your last day on earth over and over again. I probably thought the phrase over a thousand times as I sat there. The Beatles song ""A Day in the Life"" played on loop in my mind, but not the nice part, the scary, dissonant crescendo part. The only words in my mind I could hear were YOU'RE DYING, YOU'RE DYING, YOU'RE DYING again and again.

I had just enough of my wits left in me to realize that I was about to puke so I got up as normally as I could, wobbling and jerking, and just pretended there was nobody else in the theater as I made my way for the exit. As I walked, my vision began to fail. Black spots dotted my scope of vision and things were morphing and shifting before me. I held the handrail as tightly as I could and completely lost my frontal vision as soon as I saw the bathroom. So, the last 20 or so feet I had to walk sideways like a crab using my peripheral vision as I could no longer see out of the front, only the sides. I noticed one of the popcorn minions was watching me carefully so I had to consciously act like I wasn't a drug addled lunatic because I was terrified they'd call the cops (at the time, we lived in a non legal state).

Made it to the bathroom just as the second edible peaked. I'd wager it was abound 1 to 1.5 hours after ingestion, although it felt more like 5 or 6. I stumbled into a stall and puked my guts out. I convinced myself my puke was full of blood and freaked out some more. Then I sat down on the toilet and tried to control my breathing, but every time I did I'd remember that my guts were bleeding and hyperventilate some more. I was distracted for a moment when I thought I saw a camera hidden in the stall lock and panicked some more because I thought the people in the theater were watching me on their phones through the camera in the bathroom. This sent me into a spiral so I sat on the toilet for a while burying my face in my hands and crying. At this point, I was wholly convinced of my imminent death. There was no peace with it at all, only pure, blind, primal panic. Nothing but adrenaline and the pounding of my own heart in my ears.

This period where I was alone in the movie theater bathroom was one of the worst moments of my life. I've overdosed on cocaine and opiates before, I've had severe alcohol poisoning, hell, I have had several bad trips before on both LSD and psilocybin but nothing compared to this. What I felt on those psychedelic bad trips was fear, yes, but it was more like awe and amazement to the point that made me nervous and blew my mind and my fears then were a result of my realization that I was just a teeny, little insignificant part of the universe. On an acid trip, I cried, but I also laughed and loved. Acid was scary at times but it was a good fear, the kind that makes you grow as a person. My bad weed trip, however, had no insight to offer whatsoever. There was no depth, no connectedness, no realizations, only primal, utter fear of the deepest kind that was disjointed and disharmonic. Like concentrated adrenaline and anxiety and confusion that was unrelenting, unceasing, and unyielding. I felt like a lost child in some evil and foreign place and that I would never see anyone or anything that I love ever again. Just pure fear.

After about 20 minutes in there which felt like a few more hours, my wife texted me asking if I was okay. She realized I hadn't come back and left the theater and was waiting for me on a bench outside of the bathroom. She offered to come in and help me but I didn't want to draw more attention to myself so I somehow managed to text her and say I need to just sit in here for a minute. She waited for me out there for about another 30 minutes before telling me she wanted to come get me so she could drive us home. At some point, I thought someone was banging on my stall's door and trying to get at me. Someone screaming at me to come out right fucking now. This very well could have been a hallucination of psychosis and not a real person. I don't know. It wasn't my wife, she waited outside for me as I sent her a garbled text that I'd be out in a minute.

My vision was still severely fucked up at this point and I couldn't see very well, so she took me by the arm and guided me out. I had to take the theater steps one at a time like a little old man because I was so unsteady on my feet. Somehow we made it to the car. I don't have any recollection of this journey. I remember walking out of the theater and then suddenly I'm in my car in the passenger seat. I cried a little bit more and I begged my wife not to drive yet because I was paranoid thinking the police were watching us and would drop spike strips to run us off the road. So we sat in the car for another 20 minutes before she said fuck it and drove us home, telling me I'd be more comfy if I was tripping out in bed instead of in public. I think I passed the peak somewhere on the drive home because my vision and hearing started to come back to me, and as soon as we got into the house I descended from paranoid mania into just being super fucking stoned. I fell asleep almost immediately in my bed and I was still ripped when I woke up for work the next day.

I was mentally fucked up for about two weeks after this experience. I felt semi-stoned for a solid 3 days and my memory was affected for the next 3 weeks. After a while, I tried to just laugh it off, and decided to try to smoke again. Well, it happened again, not nearly to the same degree but just enough to make me uncomfortable instead of fun-stoned. My mind just began to race and my anxieties really blew up. As soon as I took a puff, everything that had worried or troubled me that week immediately came to the front of my brain and it was all I could think about. I could no longer stand to be stoned around anyone other than my wife, as I felt they were all judging and laughing at me. So I just kinda stopped smoking. That was two years ago and every time since then that I've smoked, I'd had some degree of anxiety that made it unpleasant. I get so lost in my own head and very often spiral into a mild panic attack unless I'm at home with my wife and I can distract myself with a video game or something.

I do feel like this experience has permanently affected my brain as it relates to anxiety. Despite being in a better living situation today - better job, more money, more stability - than I was when this happened, I'm way more on edge most of the time. I live in fear of another panic attack like that, because THC seems to amplify all of my deepest fears, which is insane because for 90% of my life it had the complete opposite effect. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Anyone here gone from an enjoyer of cannabis to someone who lives in complete fear of it?"
"I was pretty much fearless as a kid but when I was 10, my Dad got a job about 50 miles away and my family had to move. From that day forward I started to experience anxiety issues. I‚Äôm 43 now and I‚Äôve got steadily worse over the years. I had a dreadful time at secondary school, a difficult time at college and a horrendous time at university. I pretty much had a breakdown in 2017 and I‚Äôve only had 2 full time jobs since the age of 16. Anxiety is so crippling!

Edit: Thank you all so much for your comments! I can‚Äôt possibly reply to you all so I will just say to everyone I am so sorry you have suffered with anxiety for ANY length of time. I wish there was a cure for anxiety and that we could all be rid of this awful affliction. You are all amazing people."
"They knowingly chose a career that includes dealing with people, one of the most common fears actually. So why are they always so shocked and angry when I panic? 

I'm always polite, and I apologise a hundred times, I just ask them to please understand that I'm on the verge of a panic attack the whole time I'm in their clinic. I had ONE dentist that would keep telling me what she's doing at all times and it was so helpful. But she's retired and any time I try to ask a new dentist to maybe try doing that too if they don't mind, they think I'm asking for way too much and never do it.

Sometimes I'll go for just a check up and they'll say that they could do some work while I'm there but I CAN'T. I had to mentally prepare for this checkup for 2 weeks beforehand, I can't deal with anything more than that right now. Then they try to pressure me and get literally angry (!!) at me for refusing.

I'm so tired I really want to finally fix all my teeth but my anxiety is only getting worse when every time I think to myself ""it won't be THAT bad"" it actually is. "
"I drove 40 mins for a job interview, got there 30 mins early, was going to go in 15 mins early but then a sercuity officer knocked on my window and told me it was a private parking lot and I couldn't park there. My heart was racing and my hands started to shake but I managed to say I was there for an interview, was told I could park there and if not where should I go? The guy just said idk maybe across the street at that church, but you have to move. I was just really embarrassed, confused and overwhelmed so I just left....

I really hate myself"

Idk if it‚Äôs allergies or anxiety but I swear everytime I start to feel the slightest bit anxious it‚Äôs like I have a tickle or phlegm in my throat that just DOESNT go away. I also get back stiffness that again idk if it‚Äôs because of newly discovered arthritis in my spine which has been there for years come to find out or if my anxiety is making my back feel for tight and stiff. What crazy things do you guys feel when you‚Äôre anxious?

"How old is everyone? I‚Äôm turning 50 in a few weeks and feel like the oldest one on this sub. I‚Äôve had bad health anxiety since I was at least 18.

"My wife‚Äôs ex has a baby with their new partner. So, the baby has nothing to do with my wife. 

Today, my wife licked a lollipop that was her exes baby‚Äôs. I found this a tad strange. However, could just about cope. Then the lollipop went directly from my wife‚Äôs mouth into her exes mouth. This made me feel very odd. 

My wife asked what was wrong and I said ‚Äúthat was just a strange situation, that you licked it and then your ex did‚Äù. She huffed and rolled her eyes, and that was the end of the interaction. 

I understand that I over think absolutely everything (I have both adhd and autism and severe social anxiety) but I felt like I wasn‚Äôt out of order to feel weird after witnessing my wife‚Äôs ex lick my wife‚Äôs saliva‚Ä¶?

Please let me know if it‚Äôs just my crazy head? I find it so hard to put things into perspective."
"Seriously. Delete reddit. This place is a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù factory for people like us with disordered anxiety. I realized today that every time I open this app I get a little twinge of adrenaline not knowing what to expect and which post will make me spiral. Add to that all the arguing, downvoting, and general pettiness and this place is an assembly line for cortisol, adrenaline, anxiety, frustration, and panic. It also fuels the compulsive side of people with anxiety disorders.

"Years ago when I was 15, I got psychologically evaluated. My iq was a bit difficult to determine due to how dysfunctionally depressed I was. (GAD/MDD/PTSD/ADHD/Substance Abuse diagnosed) It was around the 70s‚Äô, however she estimated around 82 iq overall. 

In my junior year I was the only kid that didn‚Äôt finish the ACT on time. Even with an extension from my 504 plan. 

Weeks ago I was curious about my iq again, thinking maybe the test was wrong cause I was a kid with several untreated mental problems. Im currently on meds, and in therapy. Also off most drugs but weed and nicotine. I took an iq test online‚Äî look I‚Äôm aware people say those aren‚Äôt the most accurate. Plus my drug use at a young age‚Ä¶But I didn‚Äôt expect to get exactly 82 iq again. Maybe atleast average. That triggered my anxiety even on meds. I don‚Äôt have money to actually retake a professional test, but now I can‚Äôt stop ruminating over it. I always suffered through poor self esteem and a massive inferiority complex, with a dash of dependence and reliance on other people. I had little trust in my own judgement to begin with, but now it‚Äôs completely gone. I can‚Äôt handle such uncertainty like that. 

What if every opinion and any word out of my mouth is just‚Ä¶wrong? Every perspective, consideration, or reasoning I come up with feels like it‚Äôs poorly defined. I feel like theres more I should be knowing, or that I‚Äôm behind in understanding. I‚Äôve always been a helper, I love helping people with anyway I can but I‚Äôm too scared since my problem solving skills are insufficient, what if I make things worse? Also I‚Äôm a very slow person, someone can help faster and better. 

I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm just scared to do anything with my brain now. I have significant trauma of feeling like so little, and the iq is almost proving those feelings as true. Im so vocal about how stupid I feel, everyone in my real life disagrees. But they could be bias. 

I can‚Äôt exactly pinpoint why it bothers me so much, I just know that my capability to do things has been a sensitive topic for me for years. It‚Äôs clear IQ isn‚Äôt what makes a whole person. So It‚Äôs probably trauma and external opinions based. Idk. Advice is welcomed but I wanted to vent somewhere. My friends and family are probably sick of hearing about it from me. 

Anxiety did nothing but ruin my self image and become so self absorbed in the little things within myself. 

Edit: I‚Äôm seeing a lot of replies within a few minutes, kind of unexpected and overwhelming- I see lots of positive comments so ty. I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as bad in anyway. I have history of ruminating over very insignificant things .. i think this stems even deeper than just the ‚Äúiq test‚Äù  

Edit 2: I just wanna say, sorry if I don‚Äôt reply back. Just know I likely have read your message and I greatly appreciate it. I think I‚Äôll keep this post up despite the anxiety, just so I can go back on it if I ever start to spiral. 

Edit 3: Fixed errors. Also No, my post was not written by ai. üòÇ Im actually considering what I can do with my writing abilities due to all the feedback I‚Äôve gotten. It‚Äôs been very eye opening for me to gain this much input from strangers who don‚Äôt even know me. I have a lot of restructuring to do with my thoughts. Im still really young (talking fresh out of highschool) by the way. I swear, I need to go back to therapy so I can put these bad thoughts to rest. Lol. "

"I had pretty bad anxiety for the last year, it came out of nowhere really (25F). It was mainly performance anxiety like going to college or going to work. Then, I couldn‚Äôt even hang out with my friends of 10 years without feeling like I‚Äôm gonna throw up. It got to the point where I‚Äôd throw up before work and I‚Äôve been there for 3 years, extremely familiar with the people, environment, whatever. 

I finally told my mom while I was in a really anxious state and she gave me 10 mg of propranolol. It felt as though it immediately worked. It subsides all the physical symptoms like racing heart, sweating, shaking, nausea, etc. 

I made an appointment with my primary and he prescribed it to me. The 159/90 blood pressure probably helped with the prescription as it is for blood pressure &amp; heart rate specifically but nonetheless I am using it for anxiety now. 10 mg a day, not a big dose. I haven‚Äôt felt one pang of anxiety in an entire week almost since I started taking it everyday. 

I never knew how difficult anxiety was just hearing it from people but to live it.. it‚Äôs a different story. 

If you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôm praying you feel some relief soon.

"i mean, what illness triggers you the most? like if you have any symptoms, you instantly go in panic mode?
mine is diabetes. my father had it, he wasnt handling it very well. he was often fainting and even falling into comas repeatedly. 
so im very scared of getting diabetes too, considering my father got his diagnosis only when he fell into coma for the very first time. 
so whenever i feel some sensations that are common with low blood sugar i instantly start panicking :( and having snacks doesn't help me much, bc i think a lot of times its just my anxiety and not low blood sugar 
im veeery afraid of passing out

"i have general anxiety and my body feels anxious most of the time. i feel dizzy, sick, on edge, dissociated and just weird in general a lot of the time. 

when i talk to people about anxiety, they say ‚Äúyes i always overthink things‚Äù or ‚Äúi always get anxious about going to parties incase i embarrass myself‚Äù etc. but my anxiety is always there and it‚Äôs not anxious thinking, it‚Äôs just anxiety in my body. specific things don‚Äôt necessarily make me anxious, i am just always anxious.

it feels like people don‚Äôt really understand it when i say that. a lot of people i speak to seem to think that overthinking is severe anxiety, which i‚Äôm sure can be just as bad, but it makes me feel worse that people don‚Äôt feel as awful as i do but claim to have severe anxiety. 

all types of anxiety is bad, there is no worse or better when it comes to anxiety, just different. but people just never understand or relate to the type of anxiety i have and how much it affects me every day. it‚Äôs not just overthinking or going to parties that makes me anxious, it‚Äôs just as simple as waking up in the morning &amp; even leaving the house. i don‚Äôt even have to leave the house to be anxious to the point of a panic attack lmao"
"Idk if I phrased that right anyway here‚Äôs mine:)

Recently I started waking up a bit early just to hear the sounds of the early morning pigeons.

Smell of rain, dimmed lights, and VERY SPECIFIC genres of music.
I realize most of these r nature related, it might have to do with me hibernating in my house 24/7 but yeah.

Edit: just remembered some more; showering in dim light with no music, stargazing or looking at the moon somewhere with no street light. Waking up earlier than everyone and sleeping later than everyone. Sleeping with no lights at all and having the blinds slightly open. Opening car windows for fresh air when driving instead of the AC. Being a minimalist in general and reading instead of watching movies (to feel more productive lol). Feeling cold OR having wet hair, I love letting my hair air dry idc how damaging it is.

"I hate everything anxiety does to you, makes you weak, makes you dysfunctional, you can't simply ignore it, it's already a hell of a living to fight your mind everyday, now add the physical symptoms. I hate living like this, if it's really what I have to pit up with my whole life might as well end it now, I'm really tired y'all, I just want to be normal, go out and genuinely enjoy myself, not to be thinking all the time when will my next panic attack will be. I don't want to feel alone and misunderstood. But it's damn easier giving up than having to put up with this hard shit. 
I don't want panic attacks anymore, I don't want to feel sick all the time, miserable, different from everybody else and them thinking I exaggerate things. 

I've been told anxiety is good and stuff, well yeah when it doesn't literally interfere with your life and how you function. How it makes you think you're worthless for having to take medication to be a functional human being, when even sometimes medication fucks you up as well. "
"Two years ago I was diagnosed with IBD. The first symptoms I had was during stressful times of life, my anxiety/panic (I get both but at different times) attacks happened multiple times a day. At the same time my stomach couldn‚Äôt digest. I‚Äôll save those details. 
Now with my IBD under control, my anxiety/panic attacks are less than one a week. But when my stomach is full, bloated, upset or I need to use the restroom I feel the start of an anxiety/panic attack. Now that I know how everything is connected I can think my way out of an anxiety/panic attack. 
I‚Äôm glad I know, and guess I‚Äôm looking for similar stories. Maybe this post can help someone else figure out how their down digestion health affects thier mental health."
"I saw a post from earlier today about klonopin but it was locked. Many comments demonized benzo use, as usual. It's basically if Satan and Hitler had a baby and converted it into a tablet.


I've take a low dose of Klonopin essentially daily for many years now. I've posted about it here before but not in awhile. I've posted my story, which I'll briefly tell again:


Anxiety forever due to I believe genetic reasons and bullying growing up. Depression was there as well. In 2013 it boiled over into panic attacks and I've never been the same. I believe it was due to personal stress + first responder stress + financial stress + alcohol abuse + high caffeine intake.


Since then I've tried two dozen mental health medications for my symptoms which are anxiety, depression, brain fog, OCD and such. SSRIs helped take the edge off but chronic anxiety remained right beneath the surface. These other meds caused many other side effects from sexual dysfunction to weight gain to exacerbation of dissociation and anhedonia. I've even tried Spravato, which was tedious.


Additionally I've tried other avenues. Therapy (on number 4), supplements (Ex: L-Theanine, Taurine, probiotics, Lithium Orotate, methylfolate, and much more), hormone therapy (diagnosed low T and am on TRT), meditation, and more.


Klonopin is the only thing that helps adequately. I don't feel GREAT and still suffer daily, especially with dissociation, but klonopin makes it more tolerable. I try to not take it and power through and I regret it every single time. So what're my choices? Take it and live a more tolerable life so I can work, be present for my family, and be able to merely go shopping without feeling super dizzy and disoriented OR suffer? 


I don't abuse it recreationally, nor have I ever. I don't use illicit drugs. I don't use marijuana. I don't drink alcohol. I just want klonopin and to use it as prescribed without being demonized by others. I don't even take my full dose of .5mg, I usually take a half in the morning and maybe another quarter or half mid day as needed.


I dont think it should be the first plan of attack on anxiety, I get that. But when someone has exhausted the ""safer"" options then this should be allowed without question. How medications pcer the past decade went from them being thrown at you with ease to being super strict isn't OK. For example, pain meds. I had spine surgery and they gave me 4 pain pills.


So please don't judge."
"Last week, a very heavy rain hit my neighborhood. The news said it was a small tornado. It was very scary, and my house suffered a lot of damage. During the tornado, I had a panic attack. I heard things breaking around my house, it was so horrifying and I‚Äôm also terrified of the rain. 
My mother was worried about the rain and also me having the attack that day. 
Today, my therapist said that ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt fair‚Äù for me to give something else to my mother to worry about (my attack) when she was already worried about the rain. 
I felt very sad because of course I didn‚Äôt have an attack on purpose. I wasn‚Äôt trying to worry my mother even further. Now I don‚Äôt know how to feel."

Open to supplements / dietary recommendations, anything else.  I‚Äôm just desperate to feel happy and excited about life again, without feeling panic about absolutely every future scenario. "
It'll only make things worse. Anxiety is harmless.
"I've been dealing with panic attacks (specifically health anxiety induced panic) for 14 years now. I've been on and off medication, but always end up falling back to xanax (prescribed). However, with such a stigma surrounding not only anxiety in general, but also the medication surrounding it, specifically benzos, there were times I would try to hold out and not take my medication due to some guilt. I would hold out and hold out until the panic attack would get so bad, I was past the point of return. I've driven myself to the ER more times than I'd like to admit because I waited too long, didn't get in front of my attack, and wound up letting spiral out of control. I always try meditation, breathing techniques or grounding before I rely on my xanax. However, it's taken my years to realize that's it OKAY to take it if you need it. I'm very careful with it, and don't take one if I know I can get through my panic without it. That being said, if I know I'm in for a rough one, I take a xanax with no guilt and no hesitation. You wouldn't feel guilty for taking some ibuprofen for a headache. Why should you feel guilty about taking medication for another health concern. 

That's all. That's my rant. It's OKAY to your medication. Don't be like me and spend years feeling guilty about something I was prescribed. "
I‚Äôve been having anxiety and panic attacks for a couple weeks now and go from having regular things like Fast heart beat to things like jaw pain and burning on the back of my neck. Wondering what unique symptoms people get when they have anxiety/panic attacks.
"Ive noticed there is a weird stigma here that seems to tie to ego about medication. Some folks act like they are too high and mighty to use medication or they say its ""covering up your problems with drugs"". Which is not true.

If you have thyroid issues, you take medication to fix your TSH. If you have heart issues, you take a beta blocker to help with electrical signals being sent to the heart. Its nothing different when it comes to the brain, some chemicals are off. And medication can help level those out.

This will help you build coping mechanics and give you the tools to actually work with yourself

Please, if you are struggling and havent talked with your doctor about it, do so. It will change your life for the better. I just wanted to post this as there are quite a few comments and posts in this sub that has kept me and others from getting the help we need.

Ive been on lexapro (SSRI) for 46 days, and metoprolol (Beta blocker) for about 30 days. My whole life has completely changed for the better. Finally getting back to my normal life, pursing college again (nearly done with pharmacy tech school and will be going to EMT school at the end of this year), getting back to work, just getting shit done.

I will say most of my symptoms (but not all) are attributed to likely my thyroid (getting my levels checked again by an endo in a month since my TSH was out of wack). I was/am having mystery symptoms and that caused me severe severe panic and OCD. That panic and OCD has significantly calmed down. Regardless though, its gets better. I promise you that. Do what you need to do for yourself and dont worry about what others think about your choices

Wish everybody the best! You got this

Edit- if you want to argue, refer to my first few sentences of this post. "
"Like seriously? Is there a hack to make it feel not so long? I think my anxiety (or maybe its ADHD, I don't know) makes it feel soooooo long. My anxiety is probably mild compared to ya'lls, but I still felt miserable the last time I did 8 hour shifts. Its like I'm just not built for the workforce. I think most people just forget about how long they'll be there and they just get busy with their tasks and time goes by faster for them. But for me, I can't stop thinking about what time it is and how long until I can leave. Being unconsciously on edge for so long just wears me out man. I feel really pathetic for not being able to handle normal working hours like all the other adults. Any advice??? I need to get a full time job eventually.

Edit: kinda funny how half the comments here are downvoted heh"
"Hey everyone,

I just wanted to take a moment to remind you that if you‚Äôre struggling right now, you‚Äôre not alone, and there‚Äôs an entire community here that understands what you‚Äôre going through. Anxiety can feel incredibly isolating, like you‚Äôre the only one dealing with it ‚Äì but that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Every person here has felt that weight, and we‚Äôre all in this together.

It‚Äôs Okay to Feel This Way: Anxiety isn‚Äôt something you can just ‚Äúswitch off.‚Äù It‚Äôs valid to feel what you‚Äôre feeling, no matter what anyone else says. Give yourself permission to feel and know that it‚Äôs part of the process.

**Breathe** I know it sounds simple, but if you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed, take a deep breath in‚Ä¶ and let it out slowly. Repeat a few times. Grounding yourself through breathing can help take the edge off, even just a little bit.

**Focus on Small Steps** When everything feels too big, try to focus on the smallest step forward, like drinking a glass of water, stretching your arms, or even just sitting in silence for a few moments. Small victories can add up.

**Reach Out If You Need** If you want to share or need support, this community is here to listen. Sometimes, just typing out your feelings can be a release. Remember, you don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúhave it all together‚Äù to be welcomed here.

Take it one day, one hour, or one moment at a time. Whatever you‚Äôre facing right now, please know it‚Äôs not permanent. You are so much stronger than you might feel in this moment, and this community is here for you every step of the way.

Sending calm and warmth to each of you. You‚Äôve got this, and we‚Äôve got you. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

"I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but my bowel movements are always accompanied by farts, and sometimes they're really loud. My roommates are home majority of the time and go nowhere. We all live in an apartment and unfortunately our bathroom is really small, close to the bedrooms and has no electric vent filter noise. I've tried using loud music or playing my phone really loud but every now and then I can still hear them laugh and I'm not sure if it's at me or if they're minding their own buisness. 

What I'm getting at is, I understand that we are human and pooping and farting is a human thing and people who judge others who do that are probably just immature, but I can't seem to poop comfortably and I've been getting stomach aches every now and then from holding it. It's like how I hate pooping in public bathrooms, I feel the same way at home. How can I feel safer pooping? Should I just let it all out and not care, should I wear earphones and blast music so I don't hear the laughing? What should I do?

I will think something somatic is causing it - every. single. time. It's so hard to convince myself that yeah, you felt something, your anxiety made it momentarily worse, but you're good now.

I think I just need to hear how common this is, to not feel so alone."
"I have struggled with health anxiety pretty much every day for YEARS. I want to take this as an opportunity to remind fellow health anxiety sufferers of a few things:

1. HUMAN BODIES ARE WEIRD!
The human body can experience strange, uncomfortable, and even painful sensations no matter how healthy you are! It‚Äôs important to note that when you feel one of these sensations, it‚Äôs very unlikely to be anything bad. Anxiety can make you feel unsafe, but you are safe!

2. YOUR ANXIETY CAN MAKE SYMPTOMS AND SENSATIONS MORE NOTICEABLE!
Hyper focusing on a small sensation or pain can actually make it feel even more painful and uncomfortable. Your brain is playing tricks on you! Anxiety can even make you feel things that aren‚Äôt actually there! 

3. LISTEN AND TRUST YOUR DOCTORS!
If you are anything like me and frequently visit your doctor for every little thing, it‚Äôs important to listen to what your doctor has to say! If your doctor tells you nothing is wrong, 99.9999% of the time they are telling you the truth. It‚Äôs much easier said than done to put complete trust into your doctors, especially when you are a chronic worrier. However, you need to remember these people know way more about the medical world than you do! They are a reliable source! Your anxiety isn‚Äôt!

4. ANXIETY COMMONLY CAUSES PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS!
Anxiety can cause sooooo many different physical symptoms that can vary from being mild to being debilitating. Chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches, fatigue, body aches, blurry vision, abdominal pain, and SO many more symptoms can all be tied to anxiety! Of course if you are worried about your health you should check with a doctor, but if you have any chronic anxiety disorder it‚Äôs super likely that a physical symptom has something to do with that. 

All in all, health anxiety is very serious and can be extremely draining. Your mind is constantly playing tricks on you, but chances are you are safe and healthy. Just know you aren‚Äôt alone in this! You are stronger than your anxiety!‚ù§Ô∏è"

"I‚Äôve been lurking for years, and finally felt a sense of belonging and understanding after reading the OCD subreddit so decided to actually make an account and post. It hasn‚Äôt  even been a full week yet. In a separate subreddit, I was vulnerable and opened up but feel like people got upvoted for being mean/harsh in their comments? Like they all jumped in and banded together? I deleted Instagram a long time ago, and really any kind of internet community makes me question myself so I‚Äôm not sure why I thought this would be different. Thinking of going off. I don‚Äôt think this is good for me. Has anyone else felt like this and what value do you get from staying on?

Edit: I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting, but I am pretty blown away by the positive reception here. Guess anxiety sub Reddit are my peeps! "
"Really needed a cable and target nearby had it, so I just went for it. Put AirPods in as a crutch but, still did it. Just pushed through the fight or flight response and the rush of adrenaline symptoms. One exposure at a time. üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
Just curious to see if anyone has discovered that there actually was something wrong with them and it wasnt just anxiety? I luckily haven‚Äôt had that happen to me but curious if anyone else has.
I just can‚Äôt fathom how people are able to sleep with so many different people or complete strangers and I can‚Äôt fathom why it‚Äôs considered so weird when someone finds out u don‚Äôt. Am I the only one with major anxiety about sex or just going after the opposite gender in general? Like I don‚Äôt understand how everyone‚Äôs so comfortable approaching others with the intent to date and sex and then actually doing it just seems like so much
"TL;DR: Running as a preventive measure for my morning anxiety has been bringing me a lot of relief on symptoms on a regular basis. 

My therapist has emphasized that regular exercise is the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù for managing anxiety (not sure if true or not). He explained that incorporating 30 to 40 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise into my routine each day could significantly help reduce anxiety, especially if I do it proactively rather than trying to calm myself down in the middle of an attack.

Since I usually wake up at 5:30 a.m. feeling either anxious or unusually alert, I‚Äôve started this ritual where I grab a piece of fruit, lace up my running shoes, and head out for a 30-minute jog. Some days even walking fast is enough. Without exception, I notice a positive shift every time I do this, even if I'm having a bad day. 

I thought this would be insightful and help some people as well. "
"Need help changing my thoughts, anything to read that might comfort or make me laugh. "
"Is there anyone else in their 30‚Äôs who have been mentally unwell their whole life and have no job, resume, partner, kids, money, essentially dropped out of society and dependent on others to even drive places? Bonus points if your interests are ‚Äòyoung‚Äô ie anime, gaming, clinging to things from your childhood like Harry Potter and 90‚Äôs cartoons?

I really struggle to accept myself. Anxiety and OCD robbed me of hitting any adult milestones and I fear nobody my age will ever relate to me and I‚Äôm so sick of therapists trying to be a cheerleader and telling me how much I have to offer when I objectively don‚Äôt have anything to offer, cannot function and don‚Äôt even feel my age

"
"I ask because I think it might be helpful for some people with health anxiety to see that what they're feeling is scary but completely normal. 

For me, I've felt: 
- sharp chest pains
- left arm pain from elbow to wrist
- constipation
- loud stomach noises 
- dizziness like being on a ship
- palpitations 
- Increased heart rate
- acid reflux
- weight on chest when lying down

I've been checked by a doctor and the conclusion is always anxiety. I even feel a lot calmer after seeing the doctor. "
"Always get pain or numbness in my left shoulder or arm, always get heart flutters, always get chest pain either in the middle or on the left side where the heartbeat is felt or squeezing sensation,  shortness of breath, chest discomfort, etc.  how the hell am I supposed to know when it‚Äôs legit? By dropping dead? Any symptoms I get the first thought from my family doctor is anxiety related, same with me as if I don‚Äôt think that I start to freak out, go to the hospital and be told I‚Äôm fine. They say you should get checked out any time you have symptoms like these but if you have anxiety you‚Äôre supposed to ignore it or else it just leads to constant pointless hospital visits. You could be actually dying and wouldn‚Äôt even know it as you and those around you will tell you it‚Äôs anxiety. "
"Does anyone else feel like they need to be mid-activity anytime you‚Äôre anxious and being watched? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a typical tick because they‚Äôre very purposeful but it feels necessary at the time. Common examples:

-digging through my bag like I‚Äôm looking for something even though I‚Äôm not 
-drinking water when I‚Äôm not thirsty 
-picking up a pen and acting like I‚Äôm thinking about something to write 
-pretend to call someone/listen to a voicemail "
"I saw a similar post to this but it was about psychosis after smoking weed and I don‚Äôt think I get psychosis. The last time I took a Delta 8 gummy (didn‚Äôt know at the time but I took double the dose) and I was knocked out cold but on the journey to my bed I just couldn‚Äôt function. My heart gets really loud and freaks me out, I twitch really bad and when my bf told me later that he got home and I was on the bed and was slurring my words trying to talk to him. Before that experience I would just try to hit blunts one time and again my heart beat would freak me out, I wouldn‚Äôt want to do anything bc my anxiety was worse and so yeah does anyone get like that? "
"I am so fucking tired that I don‚Äôt have a MOMENT of peace EVER. Not even a minute. I am always on alert and this is SO fucking tiring. I thought the meds were working but no, back to square one. I am jealous of people that are capable of living their lives and not be anxious as hell all the time."
"We are currently under a state of emergency and have never been hit by a storm of this magnitude. Tornadoes are popping up everywhere. I am terrified. I can't stop shaking. I'm alone with only my cats. I live in a very rural area and I'm worried about trees hitting my house. I feel so trapped. My chest is so tight like I can't breathe and it's not even here yet.

If you are in the path, PLEASE stay safe!"
"So every night before bed, I put on my favorite shows. I watch the same few episodes every single night and fall asleep. It‚Äôs now routine for me. It brings me comfort and puts me at ease. Does anyone else do this? Im starting to think maybe I should switch my nighttime routine. But it works wonders for my anxiety. My shows are always sunny, Rick and Morty, and what we do in the shadows."
"I understand there's a lot of stigma surrounding benzodiazepines, and I've mentioned this several times before. But here's the truth, some of us genuinely need them, just like others require insulin or beta blockers for conditions like high blood pressure.

If you're like me and have tried everything, therapy, supplements, lifestyle adjustments, for years and are still trapped in your room by debilitating anxiety, stop waiting. Seek out medication and start living your life right now, today!

Your time is now! You deserve to live in the moment.

Would you rather spend the next 20, 40, or more years bedridden just because most people are against medication?

It's strange, people accept smoking weed or drinking alcohol in excess, but the moment you take a benzo, it's considered wrong. That's unfair!

Like benzos, weed and alcohol have long-term effects. Everything does! Even the water you drink and the air you breathe contain harmful substances.

If you're constantly worrying about what will happen in 20 or 40 years, you may never truly enjoy your life.

In my family, my mom and several others have been on benzos and SSRIs for 40+ years, and they‚Äôre in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s now, completely healthy because they've never abused them.

If you need benzos every day to live a fulfilling life, go for it! Just be mindful not to misuse them.

If SSRIs are what you need, take them. Life is unpredictable, you might have a few years or several decades left, so why waste time feeling nauseous, overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts, and depressed, stuck at home?

You can live a normal life, get a job, or pursue an education. Do whatever it takes to feel better, without worrying about what others think, and focus solely on the present.

I hope everyone reading this feels better soon, just like I have since accepting that I need medication. I‚Äôm not concerned about side effects that may or may not show up in 30 or 40 years. I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

For now, I'm choosing to live my life fully, happy and functional, rather than spend decades in isolation, suffering, just because society stigmatizes medication."
"Hope this post could be helpful to many people. Sometimes we focus on what things we should do, like exercising or drinking water. But the key might be in stopping some things that harm us and generate anxiety.

  
Edit: Thank you for all your answers. I'm reading all of them today! "

"The worst one I have is the wave of chills washing through my veins. It flows from my neck and down to my hips, where it slowly warms up again before it hits the knees. Weird af. It feels like lactic acid. It's often accompanied by a feeling that my life is over. 

Have you experienced it? Do you have anything you hate more?"
I read recently that more young people than ever are getting colon cancer. Probably due to microplastics or chemicals in literally everything we eat. This has been giving me so much anxiety like is there no way to stay healthy and avoid health issues anymore?

I hate my brain. I'm eating, been up and dressed for about 2 hours and I've already had about half a bowl of whatever is in our big grinder.

I'm still ramped up to 4000, shaking like a leaf in a hurricane, and that makes it hard to drink my hot coffee and eat my poptarts

I have my favorite music playlist going, am doing my breathing exercises and moving slowly in an effort to be mindful.

"I'm wondering.. aside from the symptoms, what does anxiety actually feels like ?

  
For me it feels like something in my chest, imagine falling backward while sitting on a chair, see that rush in chest? its the same but it just doesnt go away.. What does it feels like with you ?

"I started better help about 4 months ago and I loved it to start. A way to vent, get my feelirns out without dumping them on my loved ones and that‚Äôs all great if that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre after but I needed help identifying triggers for my panic attacks and coping mechanisms to ward them off. I spent 3 months with my first therapist and one mornint had a panic attack that I was talking about and she flat out told me ‚Äúthere might be something medically wrong with you‚Äù after telling her for months I had health anxiety. This sent me over the edge. I matched with a new therapist and explained everything and they told me ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm not sure how to manage panic attacks‚Äù LIKE HOW ARE YOU EVEN A THERAPIST THATS YOUR JOB. Anyway, I needed to vent. "
"Hello everyone! I‚Äôm not sure if this is unusual or not, but anytime I feel anxious, I isolate. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in my own skin and don‚Äôt want other people to know i‚Äôm anxious. I see how people develop agoraphobia."

"I have anxiety, and I rarely drink energy drinks because I know how unhealthy they are, especially given the symptoms they can trigger for someone with anxiety.

Today, I thought, ""It's been a long time since I had one, so why not?""

But just 15 minutes after drinking it, I started feeling dizzy, lightheaded, tired, and like my legs were about to shake. 

Thankfully, I recognize these as symptoms linked to energy drinks, so I'm able to calm myself down. 

However, this experience has confirmed that I need to double down on avoiding them entirely.

So, for everyone that has anxiety; please do NOT drink energy drinks, especially if you know it‚Äôs hard for you to manage their effects."

"Anxiety easily can cause a million different symptoms. I made a near full recovery and one of the worst things I had to deal with was the symptoms. Dealing with symptoms is an endless cycle that seems to never end. When I lost the fear of 1 symptom, I had a new one the next week. Its important to understand these symptoms because it takes away the power they have over you. Here is a SHORT list of the symptoms I had. I easily had 100+ symptoms, and I am leaving out the dpdr and ocd symptoms. I have recovered 95% from all of this. Feel free to ask me about any of these symptoms!

7. Compulsions: Reassurance seeking. constant googling. 
8. Depersonalizion Derealization: This was one of the worst ones. This has 100 symptoms tied to it. Everything looks 2d, flat, and like a video game. Felt like I was outside of my body permanately.

9. Difficulty concentrating, speaking, writing, following conversations. Felt incapabale of using my brain some days. 
10. Dissociation: Out of body type feeling. Super weird. Had it happen many times because of dpdr. 
11. Brain chatter: Brain doesnt stop talking 24/7. Music in my head, thoughts, words, conversations etc. its like my brain doesnt have a damn off button. Super scary at first but now its just annoying and barely happens. This is a common OCD symptom

"Studies show that people who suffer from anxiety tend to watch the same TV shows and movies over and over again. Knowing what is going to happen provides a level of comfort and predictability. If this is true for you, what are your favorite comfort shows/movies? I‚Äôll go first: 

TV: 

The Office - US and UK
South Park
Reno 911

"I've tried going to therapy a couple of times. I ended up with outrageous therapists. I actually told my current therapist about some of the things they've said to be and he was shocked. 

For now I like my current therapist. But I don't know if it will help me. I've had around four session + one get to know me session. I know it takes time but we aren't working through anything. It's just me complaining about an hour and him saying ""I understand"", ""your feelings are valid"". I don't feel like I'm making any progress. And yes I know it's just the beginning but I've been to therapy before. Around 6-7 times. And 4 of those times I stuck for months. I didn't feel like it was any help at all. "

"I disclosed my depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts (downplayed) and since then, my anxiety has increased dramatically. It feels like I‚Äôm spiraling out of control and I‚Äôm in the passenger seat just bracing for the inevitable crash. I keep feeling like I made the worst decision of my life by disclosing it all. Like something awful will come of it. I‚Äôm starting Zoloft and just the thought of doing it is making me extremely anxious. So many thoughts of ‚Äúwhat if I change in my personality for the worse?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if this makes me feel worse? Idk if I can handle that.‚Äù And so many more. Has anyone else experienced this? Are these worries unfounded? I lied to the doctor about having someone to talk to about it but truth is, I have no one. I‚Äôm completely alone and just deal with it myself. Just wondering if anyone else experienced this or if it‚Äôs just me."
"Been spending 4 hours a day on forums like reddit and google in the past few weeks fuelling my health anxiety. I‚Äôm insanely fatigued and am searching for an explanation but it‚Äôs never ever enough.

I keep reassurance seeking, I‚Äôm tired, I‚Äôm constantly overstimulated and living in absolute agony.

I love this community, always so much support and insight, so I wanna thank everyone in here, but for now I really gotta quit everything. Even this community. I gotta totally detox from socials and everything else and focus on therapy.

Hopefully from this day on I can change, love you all‚ù§Ô∏è

"I have had severe anxiety problems since at least around 15. To the point where my heart would beat so fast so constantly they put me on a two week heart monitor. Around that time I was given a couple Xanax after I was told it was probably because of my anxiety. it worked really well and for a while I didn‚Äôt need anymore. For the last 10 years, though, I have gone up and down with mental health and anxiety as I‚Äôm sure many of you have. In my downtime where I‚Äôm having panic attacks almost every other day, and just living in a general sense of existential dread that nothing can pull me out of. They have prescribed me, weaker versions in the past that I don‚Äôt think helped. I mean, I‚Äôve been on all kinds of SSRI‚Äòs, alternatives to Xanax, PPI blockers, and none of it has ever given me the relief in a panic attack like a simple, small little dose of Xanax. It is so frustrating how people refuse to prescribe it to people who actually need it. I‚Äôm not asking for a huge 50 pill refill. I just want like five or 10 to keep in my cabinet for emergencies on days where I really feel like the world is ending and I‚Äôm dying. Every time I‚Äôve managed to get someone to prescribe it to me temporarily, usually after some hospital visits from severe panic attacks or whatever, I have never abused it or felt the urge outside of seeking relief from my severe anxiety. It‚Äôs like the pendulum has swung in the other way and instead of giving it to everybody they‚Äôre not even giving it to the people who need it. 

And if I decide to be bold and advocate for myself and ask for it, then they just immediately assume I‚Äôm some druggie. Just because I‚Äôm educated on my own body and have gone through a lot of trials and errors on what helps me. Maybe I can try switching doctors until I find one that accommodates what I need. "

"Is anyone else just really tired of working? I‚Äôm four years in the workforce and my mental health has never been worse. I have constant anxiety about work and it‚Äôs ruining my life. I have panic attacks throughout the day, am shaking half the time, and it‚Äôs causing stomach issues. 

I‚Äôm tired of always thinking I‚Äôm messing up, tired of getting up at the crack of dawn, tired of my life revolving around work. I genuinely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be happy in any job to be honest.

"Last night I took only a 10mg  edible - yes only 10mg (of an indica hybrid gummy).  I'm not a normal user. I've only taken edibles once and didn't have an affect on me. (Maybe because I had a full stomach of food?) This time, I ate them on an empty stomach hoping to feel something. I had the **worst** 'trip' of my life. I had recurring panic attacks for 4-5 hours straight after taking the edible. I felt extremely dissociated and like I'd had a stroke. It felt like it wasn't going to end and I thought I was going to die with my extreme heart rate. I eventually fell asleep and I'm still feeling quite anxious today. I feel disoriented and a bit dissociated still, my entire perception feels different. It's quite strange and difficult to explain. I have baseline anxiety disorder and was actually weaning off of my Lexapro because I had been doing so good! Now I feel like I've triggered a new normal of constant panic attacks and this brain fog like-feeling. I feel so out of it. I hate this. I'm usually very sharp and quick on my feet and a great problem solver. Did I wipe out my normal mental state by taking these?

Hoping someone that has had similar experiences can provide some reassurance. Did you get better? How long did it take? Is this permanent? Please help!"
"So with the recent election results in the US, I know I'm going to be constantly surrounded with the most soul crushing news every single day. I remember the 2016 election cycle, and the next four years after that, I was deep in my doomscrolling and it seemed like every time I refreshed or opened an app, some new ridiculous, dangerous, ugly thing was being reported.

It affected my mental health so much and drove me into having panic attacks, aggression, nihilism, and even suicidal thoughts once in a while. I know this time will not be any different, and in fact, will probably be *much* worse.

I told my wife as soon as the results were out that it's a great idea to get off of social media as much as possible, as it's only going to make things worse. So I advise you all, for the sake of your mental health, limit your screen time. Go outside, read, exercise, play music, hang with friends, do what you gotta do to escape this reality and do what's best for you.

We live once, and things like this are usually outside of our control, so it's best to focus on you and the people you love and care about. I love you guys, good luck to you all out there, and take care of yourselves and each other.

"Like if you have had it your entire life, your brain just thinks this is the normal way to behave so you think it doesn‚Äôt effect you but in reality it does?"
"For 3 years ago I was at the gym. I was doing my normal push routine while all of the sudden I felt immense pain in my chest. I laid the weights beside me and sat down, my heart was pumping, it was pumping harder than ever before and worst of all, it was beating irregularly. I panicked, my vision became distorted and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I thought I was dying. My hands went numb and I was shaking.

When I was 19 years old I had my first panick attack, and from there on, my life went down like a lead balloon. Constant panic attacks, worrying, isolation, bad grades, depression, stress and horrible somatic symptoms.

I couldn‚Äôt even ride the bus without getting a panic attack. I was doomed, rock bottom.

During the years I‚Äôve attented therapy with no or little result, I‚Äôve read books, went to the hospital etc. Nothing really worked so I started experimenting with my anxiety and this is my warm recommendations:

1. **Consult with a proffesional**:Take a trip to the hospital if you‚Äôre experiencing somatic symptoms - I assume that you‚Äôre just like me, I never accepted that my heart palpation was because anxiety and thus feared the worst. Consulting with a proffesional will only do good and hopefully lower the anxiety.

2. **Meditate**: I found myself in constant stress, I was afraid of letting my body relax which kept me in a vicious cycle of constant panic. I strongly advise you really try to get in a relaxed state with meditation even though it can be very scary depending on the intensity of your anxiety. 

3. **Accept the anxiety**: I understand that when you‚Äôre experiencing a panic attack there‚Äôs little or no rationality going on in your head, but understand that a panic attack will never hurt you, no matter what. What you‚Äôre currently experiencing is just a set of symptoms of stress, and whilest it might - or probably will be terrifying it will subside. Learn to be okay with having a panic attack, and embrace them. And when you‚Äôre really feel like you got this you can even try to induce them. Because afterall, panic attacks are completely harmless! :)

I‚Äôve noticed that my anxiety is moreoften a consequence of my state of mind rather than a certain event occuring. And the best way of coping with this is with some consistent set of rules:

1. **No alcohol**: I think this is a nobrainer but easier said than done, please take some time of alcohol and document the result. I promise you, this is probably what will make the biggest impact
2. **Consistent sleeping routines**: Wake up the same time and go to sleep the same time. Sometimes anxiety can mess up sleep which creates a vicious cycle, I understand. Try as best as you can to get 8 hours of sleep and consult with a doctor if you‚Äôre having really bad problems sleeping!
3. **Training**: Go for a run every morning when you wake up. I promise that you will be on top of the world. Btw lifting weights will most likely not have the same positive effects as running so make sure to grab your best running shoes and go get it.
4. **Food**: eat as healthy as you can but most importantly try to eat something, start of by eating a nice breakfast. Make sure to get atleast 3 meals per day, the healthier the better!
5. **Caffeine**: avoid energy drinks at all cost, coffee is negotiable. But remember that if it makes you feel bad you need to get rid of it.
6. **Limit screen time**: with everything in our phones it‚Äôs harder than ever to get rid of it, my attention span is shorter than a gold fish‚Äôs memory and chances are that your dopamine receptors are as burnt out as mine, but i‚Äôve found that limiting screen time and make time for other things have helped me immensily, even something as simple as watching a movie instead of tiktok.
7. **Take time off**: take atleast one day of from the week were you do something for yourself, have as little obligations as possible. I always make sure to have every sunday free for just myself. I spend time on reading, fishing, take a sauna, a swim, catch up with a friend etc. This is your stress free day and you‚Äôre not allowed to work, study or whatever. This day is for you, and only you.


I wish you the best and I hope you the best, if you try to incorporate any of this I would love to hear your progress, we are in this together and I know you will soon be alright. &lt;3


Summary: 

1. **Hospital Visit:** For somatic symptoms, consult a professional. Acceptance eases anxiety.

2. **Meditation:** Break the cycle of stress with relaxation. It might be scary, but it helps.

3. **Embrace Panic:** Understand it won't harm you. Learn to be okay with panic attacks; they're harmless.

Consistent rules for managing anxiety:

- **No Alcohol:** Document the impact; it makes a significant difference.
- **Sleep Routines:** Maintain consistent sleep patterns, aim for 8 hours.
- **Exercise:** Run every morning; it lifts your spirits more than weightlifting.
- **Healthy Eating:** Three meals a day, prioritize nutritious foods.
- **Caffeine:** Avoid energy drinks, consider limiting coffee if it affects you negatively.
- **Limit Screen Time:** Reduce phone use; allocate time for other activities.
- **Take Time Off:** Dedicate one stress-free day a week for yourself, no work or study."

"I don‚Äôt get how mom doesn‚Äôt remember 99% of my childhood. 

Apparently she doesn‚Äôt remember how so many people had to give me rides home because she fell asleep and was too drunk to wake up. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times dad would be yelling from across the house (he was a quadriplegic, so he couldn‚Äôt get up and pick me up himself) and I‚Äôd be blowing up her phone with calls. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I cried on my way home when difference school teachers, other parents, theater teachers and theater friends would drive me home. I would feel so guilty that they had to take time out of their day to take me home because mom forgot. I am almost 35 and this is one of many things that happened in my childhood that still angers me so intensely. My dad has passed away, rest his soul about 13 years ago now, so it‚Äôs just mom and I. She‚Äôs been sober for 18 years now, which I‚Äôm grateful for. She just doesn‚Äôt understand how something from my childhood still bothers me so much. And I‚Äôm like, how am I supposed to not be bothered by the fact that she would quite literally leave me stranded with no way home? Not even any cash for a cab or the bus home. 

There‚Äôs other shit too that both my parents did that still bug me but I can‚Äôt talk to mom about any of it because she doesn‚Äôt remember and she just stares at me with this blank stare, which angers me so much more. Sorry, but an apology doesn‚Äôt really helpnanything when you have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about."

"Does anyone else have ‚Äúbackground anxiety‚Äù? What I mean is that even when you‚Äôre not actively panicking or having severe anxiety, do you still have symptoms that just sort of stick around constantly in the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù? If so, what are those symptoms for you? For me, when I‚Äôm having a panic attack or when my anxiety is severe, I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe. Chest tightness/pressure, sometimes dizziness and unsteadiness and tingling hands but mostly just feel like I cannot breathe. When this isn‚Äôt happening and I feel pretty in control, I still feel a constant heaviness in my chest or my heart ‚Äúfeels weird‚Äù or I feel as though I‚Äôm breathing heavily or in a labored way or my chest/breathing just feels uncomfortable in general. (I should mention I‚Äôve had a CT scan of my chest, pulmonary function tests, seen a pulmonologist etc‚Äîcurrently going through 30 days with a heart event monitor to see if there‚Äôs anything there‚Ä¶I‚Äôm on day 2). Just wanted to know if anyone else experiences this and what your symptoms are. "
What is something that you have done that has dramatically reduced your anxiety. It can be unconventional or not widely known. I'm interested in all answers. 
"I have bad anxiety to dont get me wrong. But reading about wat things set off other people‚Äôs anxiety i find funny. Mostly the catastrophising write ups, cuz i do the exact same thing. I overthink like crazy, but when ur looking at it from an outside perspective ur like ‚Äúwow this poor soul is going nuts cuz their hand was cold haha‚Äù. So it makes me think maybe people who r on the outside of the scenario im catastrophising are thinking the same thing about me. Which makes me think ‚Äúmaybe im just loosing my mind for no reason and its actually not as bad as i think‚Äù. Anxiety is so irrational, but it is comforting to know that there r other people out there dealing with the same thing. I wish we could all just laugh at our problems together."
"It's so embarrassing that I'm in my 20's and everyone that I know of (my friends &amp; cousins)  are thinking of settling with boyfriends, moving out etc, and all I think of is fixing my teeth where I'll be able to feel confident and chew foods properly. There's not a day that goes by where I don't think about improving my dental health. 

I've opted out for xmas presents this year to solely save money towards implants and braces, which I know will cost a hefty amount. But I am 100% all in, to improve my dental health and will do what it takes to maintain properly to avoid any more problems. 

I'm about to get my 5th tooth extracted this week and I just feel so down about how I've managed to neglect my oral health over the past 3 years, I have no one else to blame but myself, and the more I realise, risking my health for confectionery and junk food was totally not worth it bc I'm legit left with 24 (23 soon) teeth now. I know I can't revert to the past (even though I really wish it was possible because I would've been more cautious) I just need to work towards remaining my current teeth and practicing good oral hygiene habits. I've started todo better by flossing, brushing twice a day, and using mouthwash as well as seeing the dentists for checkups and cleaning and plan to todo this from now on end (something I didn't do 3 years ago). I'm treating myself to a water flosser this year for Christmas and I've never been more excited. 

This is just a VENT post! I'm manifesting that I'll get
braces by 2024 &amp; implants by 2026."
"I‚Äôve had anxiety for over 10 years with ups and downs. I used to have severe air hunger from anxiety and often got into (work related) spirals of catastrophising, unable to let myself feel any form of excitement or happiness because anxiety was always looming etc etc 

I‚Äôd taken magnesium on and off for years on my personal trainers advice but after seeing how someone raved about it on tik tok for their anxiety I realised I wasn‚Äôt taking the right dosage

I switched to 400mg per day and took it consistently, and OH MY GOD the results were almost instant (I noticed a feeling of mental calmness after around a week of taking it). All of a sudden I could look forward to things in the future and not feel the anxious pangs which used to always pop into my mind. Or the thoughts would sometimes pop up but I‚Äôd be able to push them aside 

A few times I stopped taking it out of laziness and the anxiety returned. As magnesium doesn‚Äôt stay in the body this makes sense I suppose? 

The brand I use is fusion magnesium 
2 tablets daily, not taken at the same time 

I‚Äôve also recently added in magnesium threonate as I  heard it crosses the blood brain barrier easier (unsure of how accurate this is!) appx 140g per day which works out to be 4 tablets (2 x twice a day) then 1 fusion tablet, so total mg would be appx 340. The results seem to be good so far

Sometimes when I‚Äôve forgotten to supplement I keep a magnesium oil spray next to my bed 

Also, not taking it at the same time as  zinc and calcium (which was previously my mistake too) as it doesn‚Äôt absorb as well 

Hopefully this helps someone else as much as it has helped me :) "
"I was getting all sorts of physical symptoms and it's hard to distinguish between what's anxiety and what's not. Especially because I have physical conditions that mimic the same symptoms (I also have a stomach ulcer).

Too! So in an effort to help yall, let‚Äôs share our symptoms! 
 
Mine are categorized under three areas:

PRIMARY:
1: feeling like I can‚Äôt swallow. Like there‚Äôs a ball in my throat. 

2: worry. I tend to worry about everything. Then my brain starts creating realities for something that hasn‚Äôt happened or happened already. 


SECONDARY:
1: chest tightness. This scares me because I‚Äôm
Asthmatic. So I start to freak out. 

2: feeling like I can‚Äôt take a deep breath. This often times comes with the feeling of not being able to swallow. 


RARE:
1: chest pain. This does happen but super rarely. 

2: super fast heart rate! This also (thankfully) happens super rarely but when it does my heart rate will spike to like 160 bpm.

"Anyone else have movies that give them anxiety? I don't mean movies with tense scenes or ones that may contain triggers, more so the thought of them or imagery makes you feel anxious? I recently saw a YouTube video easy on a old horror movie I saw a few times as a kid. It freaked me out so much back then, yet I remember watching it multiple times. Whenever I see parts of it or think about it enough to start imagining scenes from it in my head, I feel super anxious and on edge. Pit in my stomach, nausea, super jumpy, the works. The funny thing is, I'm a MASSIVE horror buff nowadays. Halloween and horror in general is practically part of my DNA as an adult. I would always see bits and pieces of other horror movies growing up, and then watch them years later when I was older and they would become some of my favorite movies ever. Its just this one movie. I've tried to watch it again in my adult life to ""conquer my fear"", so to speak, but got so freaked out and anxious I could barley sleep that night. 

  
Anyone else have feelings like this? Super curious to find out."
"I don't really mind if it kills me, but I'm just wondering if it can. Sometimes anxiety/stress feels like it can kill you or bring permanent harm. I started suffering badly since eight years ago and I developed weird symptoms since four years ago. I feel things like fatigue, not feeling healthy, (besides the fact that I lift weights and have a healthy diet) headaches, nausea etc. Is it all because of stress and anxiety? Doctors couldn't find anything."
"I seriously can't imagine that shit, that must be absolute genuine fucking luxury, just a completely bliss existence, to not be cursed with absolutely excruciating fight or flight panic and terror literally 24/7 that NEVER EVER fucking stops, and it's MOST people too, *most people* DONT experience this seemingly unending physical and mental torture

This has actually caused me to become extremely envious of every person I see because no matter how bad their circumstances may be at least they aren't absolutely terrified 24/7 for no reason, the other day I saw this rather unfortunate individual in a wheelchair who also had a facial deformity too and the first thing I thought was ""they probably don't suffer from panic attacks like I do"", I seriously get jealous of EVERYONE "
If I experience either of those physical symptoms they can ruin my whole day - everything else I find manageable. Like the idea of let‚Äôs say being at the cinemas and the thought of my heart fluttering is disheartening to want to go. But we have to try to carry on and that can be exhausting.

Sometimes minor things give me anxiety I hate it because in the end it‚Äôs usually not what I worked it up to be like‚Ä¶.Tomorrow I have an eye appointment for weeks I‚Äôve been having moments of minor panic about telling them I don‚Äôt want to buy my glasses there I just want the prescription üòíüòíüò© Ugh I hate it What‚Äôs something minor that gives you anxiety 
So basically what the title says. I‚Äôve been using 0.25mg xanax twice a day for 3 months now and it helped me tremendously but for the past week i always wake up with high resting heart rate and unbearable nausea like I used to before medication. I physically cannot get out of bed and stay under cover for HOURS. I need tips cause today I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed for EIGHT HOURS. It‚Äôs a new low for me. All advices are appreciated!!

"So, today I went to the dentist for the first time in about 10 years! I did it, I actually went through with it! I am so excited right now that I am literally shaking! 

Going to the dentist has always been triggering for me, I don't know what came over me today, I just said fuck it, and not showing up just wasn't an option. 

It also helps that I do brush and floss (partially because I didn't want to need to go to the dentist lol) and she said if I had told her it had only been 6 months since my last cleaning she would have believed me. 

It's been hours and I still feel like I'm floating. It's like I got so used to being anxious about my teeth and the dentist that it feels like a tremendous weight has been lifted off my chest now that it's over! This is such a huge win, I almost feel like I can do anything!"

But I am going to do it. I need to have people that can support me. So I am going to do it and nothing will stop me from doing it.
Sorry I am kind of using this as my journal."
About 20 min after I eat food (especially in the morning) my heart rate goes up and i get anxiety along with aches and pains all down my back and legs. It usually lasts about 2/3 hours and usually gets better as the day goes on. Anybody relate to feeling like this after they eat or just get pains from anxiety in general? The pains feel like nerve pains/ muscle pains.

"Hi everyone- 25 F here, diagnosed with depression and anxiety. In the past when I have panic attacks, they are normally triggered by extreme stress and happen relatively infrequently. I have been prescribed .5 mg Xanax to take when these occur. 

More recently, I will have a panic attack for seemingly nothing at all. I won‚Äôt even be sure that it‚Äôs a panic attack except my heart is racing, it feels hard to breathe, I‚Äôm light headed, and I feel anxious for no reason. No triggers that I can identify. 

Has anyone experienced this? Is it pretty typical of anxiety and panic disorder or do I maybe have some other underlying medical issue? 

Thanks in advance for any shared experience and advice."
"I feel like when I was in my early 20‚Äôs, therapy was a much different experience. Therapists seemed way better at their jobs than they do now. 

I would have sessions that seemed to be ‚Äúthreaded‚Äù together better.. we picked up where we left off.. therapists seemed better at digging deeper. Idk.

I‚Äôve been noticing lately that those things are harder to come by. I have cycled through so many therapists over the last six years because I‚Äôve noticed that we were just shooting the shit.

I‚Äôd open up about some pretty big things in previous sessions and in the following session, it‚Äôs like I never said it. 

I feel like I‚Äôm doing A LOT of work to start and steer the conversations and give them something to talk about. I get that in the beginning, I have to do that but after 3-4 sessions, meet me halfway!

Also.. I do WEEKLY sessions.

And yes, I am very upfront with therapists in the first session.. I explain what I‚Äôd like to work on specifically and what my pain points have been with therapy lately. 

Idk, it‚Äôs just really discouraging when I really want to do the work and build on my sessions but oftentimes I feel like I‚Äôm talking to a brick wall. 

I‚Äôm about five sessions in with my new therapist and she‚Äôs a hoot but she‚Äôs very unprofessional.. late, too chatty about her business and other peoples business, minding her phone during our sessions, and I‚Äôm prettyyyyy sure she‚Äôs a little high lol (not funny but wtf).

I‚Äôm gonna keep the faith and keep searching (I‚Äôve tried different platforms, private practices, services through my employer, etc). 

Anyone else notice this lately??? Do you feel like therapy was a little more helpful and effective in the past?

TLDR: therapy has been shit lately. Can you relate?

"Does hot weather worsen anxiety, or is it just me? I restarted my medication, so maybe it's taking time to kick in this time.

"I'm talking like nausea, poop smells so bad, abdominal burning, acid reflux, belching and bloating. Ever since my anxiety came back I've been experiencing this. Have been to the docs and they gave me abdominal/pelvic ultrasound, poop test, and blood work (all came back normal). Might go in again tmrw for some more testing like a CT but omg does anyone else feel like this? Im wondering if its stress related (since it started around the same time as my anxiety).

"I'm a 36 year old male and have been single my whole life due to extreme social anxiety, often sabotaging my own relationships. 

This past Saturday I went on my very first date. I was nervous, anxious, sometimes bordering on panic.  I am over analysing everything that was said and I can't help but be nervous I messed it up.

But I did it.  Despite everything and even if this relationship goes nowhere in the end, I went out on a date.

I just wanted to take a moment to celebrate my own victory. I know there is so much more I need to overcome, but I don't want to ignore the step I did take.

"I live in the Us. I‚Äôm already generally scared but I‚Äôm at peak anxiety with the amount of shootings this week, including one in my state."
I just need to vent.  My family asked me what are you going to do when something really bad actually happens?   How are you gonna cope if you can‚Äôt cope now over small stuff.  They have no idea the pain I‚Äôm going through because it isn‚Äôt seen like a physical illness.   I just don‚Äôt get it.  My mind tortures me every day and I get looked at as someone over reacting over things that don‚Äôt matter.  
"I struggle immensely with grocery shopping. I can‚Äôt stand how auditory overstimulating it is, how patient you have to be (constantly having to wait for people to get out of the way so you can grab your stuff and leave), the fear of bumping into people you know. It‚Äôs one giant crowd and I just hate crowds. Feel like I‚Äôm going to throw up every time. I feel so silly for being anxious over grocery shopping, but I need food since I‚Äôm almost out. 

Any tips for handling it? "
For me it was being more tired day to day bc I use alot of energy reassuring and redirecting my thoughts and/or practicing gratitude so I don't have a doom spiral
"I'm so scared of throwing up . I hate the feeling and I always feel like I'm dying. I don't want to make it worse by worrying so much . I don't want to eat or drink anything because I don't want to throw it up. Please help , I'm so scared"

How can you describe the feeling of living with anxiety?
"Whether something is going well in my life or not well, I‚Äôm constantly in fight or flight mode. Im so tired of being on edge all the time and my body prepared for something bad to happen and ruin my life. It sucks. 

Does anyone relate or have any ideas to help? Cannabis isn‚Äôt an option as my career is on the line. I‚Äôm done wasting my life away worrying and ruining my relationships."
"For a little background, I have recently been on Lexapro for 4 years and was able to get off of it about 3 months ago.  Since that time my work has been very stressful and my anxiety had been creeping back up.  I was looking for otc remedies and stumbled on delta 9 gummies which were supposed to help with anxiety.  I ordered up some of Cheech and Chong‚Äôs cruise chews that have 3mg of thc per gummy.  A week ago I stated taking 1 gummy at a time, and then a few days ago 2 gummies and today at work I took 3 at work, and then since I am off, figured I would let the good times roll and took 3 more gummies 6 hours after the first.  I figured that it was at maximum an 18mg thc dose, and at 6‚Äô6‚Äù 330 pounds it wouldn‚Äôt impact me as much.  

I literally thought I was dying.  Didn‚Äôt think I could walk, heart pounding, muscles streaming, hyperventilating, tremors, jelly legs and arms.  I kept throwing myself into bed in between nervous pacing figuring that I was about to die.  

I‚Äôm a Catholic so I said the act of contrition and told my wife I loved her but I was dying, while my oldest daughter wails because she believes I‚Äôm dying.  My wife calls 911 and an ambulance takes me to the hospital.  They do an ecg, and check my blood pressure, blood sugar and blood oxygen and all are fine.  I start talking to the emt‚Äôs in the ambulance and they say they are seeing a bunch of people freak out on edibles, some at even low 5mg or 10mg doses. 

 Anyway when I got to the hospital the gummies peaked and I started coming down and felt fine, so was quickly released, but I was just curious as if anyone else had so awful an experience with delta 9 gummies?"
"Most of my panic attacks happen because I'll realize I'm in the middle of something important, around other people, simply in public, etc., and I get this thought that lasts a split second asking myself ""what if you had a panic attack?"", and that's what sets one off.

I'm back on meds, but they seem to only work like 75% as well as before (it's been several months now), and I'm working out insurance stuff with my therapist.

Sometimes I'll get anxious before something and I'll have multiple thoughts about ""what if, what if"", and I can talk myself out of the spiral. But when it's a split second, and it can happen before or anytime during something I'm doing, I don't know how to prevent them."
"Mine is 2 and a half men and big bang theory due to growing up watching them. My anxiety has been so bad tonight because I wasn't able to eat any protein yesterday all I ate was carb (mostly bread and fruit) to fill my stomach.. As a result of that my stomach feels gurgly and empty so I'm snacking on crackers, sniffing peppermint oil and watching 2 and a half men."
Does anyone have a severe sense of impending doom that comes even without panic attacks and lingers for days and days at a time? It has a debilitated me. 
How would you describe anxiety from your perspective? I‚Äôm curious to know how it affects people differently 
"Anytime something goes wrong, ya‚Äôll think you are going to get fired?

I‚Äôm guessing this isn‚Äôt rational, since I‚Äôm good at what I do "

I'm tired of feeling anxious .  I'm tired of negative thoughts. I'm tired of feeling tired . I don't know what to do . I cant sleep which isn't helping my anxiety at all . I'm having negative thoughts all day . I can't get out of my head . I just want to feel happy . But even when I'm happy the only thought I have is : I cant be happy because for me I don't know being happy means I'll probably die soon. I miss being able to sleep without having a panic attack or thinking I'll die. I just want to sleep really . Have a good night rest and wake up feeling good. But these days it seems impossible. Whenever I feel a little bit better .my anxiety comes back worse
"This might be an odd question. When you say you have anxiety, what do you mean? I struggle talking to people about anxiety because I can never tell if we're talking about the same thing. I don't mean I worry about things. I mean I wake up in the morning and feel like I have liquid panic/jitters coursing through my veins, as if somebody injected me with it. Like a toxic skin crawly feeling that makes everything feel scary and uncomfortable. It doesn't feel mental, it's a physical reaction. And then when panic attacks happen, it's racing heart, weak legs, nausea, panic, etc.

Sometimes I'll talk to people and be like ""I was diagnosed with GAD"" and they'll be like ""oh my gosh, I have anxiety too. I worry a lot."" I don't think we're talking about the same thing. There was a period where I couldn't leave my house. I feel like there needs to be different terminology to describe what this is."
"I‚Äôm 37 years old and almost completely grey. My beard is now starting to become grey quickly. The signs of aging on me even at this reasonably younger age absolutely terrify me.

Disclaimer: I‚Äôm a very quiet introvert, but I never really thought I might have anxiety.

Today I had a biology lab/lecture  in which I arrived a bit too late (traffic), but that‚Äôs okay since a lot of students arrive late and nobody really says anything. I sat in the last row and turned my phone on to send my friend the location (she doesn‚Äôt know where the lab is).

The lecturer proceeded to say ‚Äúgirl on her phone in the last row, answer this question‚Äù. It was a question about a topic they discussed before I arrived, so she did that on purpose. I genuinely had a black out, froze and didn‚Äôt move or say anything and she kept on asking me about 5 times until she said ‚Äú stand up and come to the front‚Äù, I slowly stood up and walked to the front where she told me to sit right in front of her and continued her presentation. It didn‚Äôt end there, she asked me the question again and like previously, I froze and just stared at her completely traumatized. Eventually she carried on, but what shocked me more was the fact that my body started shaking uncontrollably. I‚Äôve NEVER experienced this but I felt like i was about to have a seizure. The tremors and shaking got so severe I had to hold on to my chair bc I was afraid I‚Äôm gonna fall soon.

What was that shaking?

"I have read so many tips and tricks about how to decrease anxiety, but I‚Äôm wondering if it may be helpful to hear about things that actually made anxiety WORSE for people. I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything to ease it but part of me wonders if I‚Äôm simply overlooking something that I‚Äôm already doing or taking. Curious what makes things worse for everyone. Mine are for sure refined sugar and caffeine.

I have recently tried things like taking ashwagandha, micro-dosing gummies, magnesium glycinate, chasteberry fruit, multivitamins, drinking more water, and excercise. "

"Long story short my mom unexpectedly passed 7 months ago. I have been slowly getting better with the amazing help from my wife. She was saying she needs some ""girl time"" with her sisters so they booked a 7 day cruise. So has days get closer to the date me and my daughter stresses to her that we are scared and worried for my daughter this has been the longest she has been away from her mother and for me this is the first time we have been apart from each other in 6 years. A couple days ago my daughter passed out and they went to the emergency room at the hospital. We discovered that she had coronavirus. After finding this out my health anxiety started a little then I was getting anxiety that my wife will be gone for 7 days with the making sure our child is ok and dealing with my intrusive thoughts and trying to not make my wife worried. Can anyone give me any advice?"

I sometimes wish i was a psychopath because they don't feel guilt remorse or anxiety! like I really wish I was born a psychopath. having anxiety is literally the opposite and I hate it.
"My daughter has always struck me as a normal teen.  She seems open and talks to us a lot, the vast majority of the days she seems happy and completely comfortable in her skin.  She's had a close friend group for years, she works hard in school and gets good grades.

She is moody sometimes, we have fights over normal parental boundary stuff (curfew, bedtime, phone usage, etc).  She gets frustrated with school or her friends and can get pretty worked up but it seems to me she bounces back and the next day or two she seems fine again.

She says she feels socially awkward and anxious in groups or around people she doesn't know.  Again, seems normal to me but last year we decided to try counseling.  I figured absolutely everyone could benefit from counseling so we were happy to pursue it.

She's been in counseling for a year and we have given her privacy, not asking about sessions and the therapist doesn't talk to us at all which we assumed was normal.

A couple weeks ago in the midst of an argument my daughter came out of nowhere accusing us of not letting her go on anti-anxiety medication.  We had heard nothing about this, and immediately texted the counselor.  She said something along the lines of ""Your daughter feel seen if we would consider medication"".  In that thread she also mentioned that after a year of counseling we sit down with her and discuss the treatment plan (also the first we'd heard of that).

We're meeting with the counselor tomorrow and I'm worried we're suddenly on the fast track to SSRIs.  I'm not opposed to medication, even moving quickly if she were experiencing suicidal ideation, or having panic attacks or if anxiety was impacting her grades, or if her angsty moods lingered for days or weeks.  I don't want to deny her experience, I'm sure she's experiencing serious anxiety, but she seems to be able to handle it.  

There are many things I would suggest trying first (diet, exercise, sleep, mediation, CBT) though when I've brought those up she seems to dismiss them as ineffective.

I guess I'm just wondering if it's common for kids who seems so outwardly healthy/normal, and whose bad moods seem very transparent, to be stoically bearing enough anxiety 90% of the time such that it warrants medication?"

"I'm very devastated lately because of the constant fear and stress i live in day to day.
Going to work is a struggle, sleeping is a struggle, there is no such thing as a calm and resting moment. When i take a break from everything, the break usually involves an intense overthinking that usually results in more stress and fear. 

I have tried therapy, i have been on medication before, but nothing seems permanent. It keeps coming back and every time it's worse than before.

I'm lately very depressed because of the fact that every event in my life whether happy or sad was always associated with a tight chest and tachycardia and unexplainable feeling of fright and an adrenaline rush. 

I have high functioning anxiety so it was never debilitating or have stopped me from performing day to day tasks. But it's like there is a dark cloud in the background glooming my life and it never leaves no matter how hard I try. "
"I have had chronic anxiety forever. I have panic attacks as well.


I'm used to just struggling in those ways. But I've noticed lately I'm thinking more about death.

Literally. The reminder that I and everyone will die and don't know when.
I'm terrified in that moment and then go about my day.

So far I've been able to shake it off pretty quickly and have it as like a passing thought and fear. 
So it's not disrupting my life any more than my panic anxiety attacks are. 
But I'm just wondering if anyone else thinks about it like this. 

I know it's normal to think I'm dying when I'm having an attack or when im focusing too much on what I feel and my body. 

But to just have the thought even when I'm feeling fine or distracted, does anyone else have this?

"Hi guys,

I‚Äôve been on generic Lexapro (escitalopram) for roughly 10 months and I just wanted to share that (the right) medication can make all the difference. I went from spending all my energy worrying about anything and everything to‚Ä¶ enjoying life. I‚Äôm not sure when it all changed but I think about 3 months into the medication. I used to be low on energy 24/7 because I was using it up on being anxious and on edge all the time. I couldn‚Äôt feel comfortable in my own home because I was scared of inconveniencing my roommate.

10 months later I can‚Äôt even imagine living like that anymore. it‚Äôs crazy that THIS is how it‚Äôs supposed to feel instead of being on edge from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep. because it was all I knew I thought it was normal. hell I doubted I even had GAD UNTIL I felt what it was like to live free of it. it has been a great journey. I picked up new hobbies, made new friends and in general feel way more secure and at peace. I started sleeping enough, eating well and even started going to the gym. medication made this possible by giving me the energy to do so. words can‚Äôt describe how much difference this medication has made in my life. I wake up every day and look forward to the day, talking to people, trying new things and just‚Ä¶ living.

the first few weeks of any medication will be rough. but once you find what works, it‚Äôs so worth it."
"Idk sometimes I see people who have deleted their accounts and I just wonder.

I'm 21. I am struggling with an anxiety disorder. I am often bothered by a variety of physical symptoms and it is already difficult for me to distinguish them from real problems in the body. What symptoms have you experienced without real confirmation of the symptom just because of anxiety
"i know there are a billion posts like this on this subreddit and i‚Äôm sorry for ranting but i genuinely feel like i‚Äôm going out of my mind. i live in constant fear that i‚Äôm going to have a stroke or a heart attack or DVT or that i have cancer or some other horrible disease. i‚Äôm only 22 and i don‚Äôt want to live like this for the rest of my life.

i didn‚Äôt always used to be like this. i always have had some general anxiety but the health anxiety ramped up a few months ago when i started having heart palpitations more often. it‚Äôs a problem my mom deals with as well and she‚Äôs gotten tested and done the halter monitor thing and she‚Äôs fine, so i‚Äôm probably just dealing with the same thing. but they happen even more often now because i‚Äôm more anxious than i‚Äôve ever been.

the worst part is i don‚Äôt have a primary care physician right now. my old one retired but i can‚Äôt get into anywhere else until like at least 3 months from now. which isn't that long in the grand scheme of things but when you're terrified every single day of dropping dead of a brain aneurysm or having a stroke or something else, it seems like ages away. i wish it was easier. i‚Äôm so tired of constantly being anxious because of a weird pain in my head or a leg cramp or something stupid.

i feel crazy. it‚Äôs affecting my life. i don‚Äôt want to go anywhere or do anything anymore because literally the slightest sensation in my body will set me off. i just want to stay home in my bed where i can hide. i want to go back to normal. but i have summer classes for university and trying to find a post-grad job and constantly feeling the weight of my student loan debt, and with this health anxiety stuff in the mix it‚Äôs all too much and i feel like i‚Äôm on the verge of a complete breakdown.

edit: i just want to say thank you so much to everyone leaving such nice comments. reading them is so comforting to know i‚Äôm not the only person dealing with this. it makes me feel less crazy. i‚Äôm so sorry that you all are dealing with this too, but i‚Äôm glad at least we can talk to each other so we know we are not alone &lt;3"
"We all the know the route to becoming better. Start exercising, journaling, quitting weed and alcohol and any kind of drugs, avoiding junk food, waking up on time, meditating and going to therapy. But the person who does this is inhuman, it‚Äôs like a caricature of a perfect person. I do not want to be perfect, I just want to be normal. Everyone around me engages in sensual pleasures but my anxiety wants me to force myself to not even touch these things. Let alone the palpitations and tightness in my stomach and other physical symptoms which arise every time, the guilt alone is unsurvivable. I hate this disease, it has ruined every waking moment of my life. Sometimes I wish I had cancer instead of spending each second fearing it. I hate living like this, I want to end myself and my anxiety with me."

EDIT 2: I have ADHD, so some factors as to why I feel this way: 
1) I have more energy than peers at this point in life and unlikely to experience a party phase but rather, go through my entire life this way (my parents have high energy but lack $ to go out as much as they want)
2) life feels really exciting when I‚Äôm going on adventures and not living a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. I love calm and peace and staying home at times (like gardening, dinner parties, reading) but need the balance to go out and dance and celebrate life (I love the stories of people going out practically every night to dance in the 20s, 40s and 70s. Huge fan of jazz, big band and groove music). Another example - I moved across the country at 22 to pursue a dream of writing and comedy. Talk about exciting!! A 9-5 today? Not my vibe. These comments have helped me realize this. I need my life to not feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and do more exciting and adventurous things. 
3) I was parentified as a kid and didn‚Äôt get to have fun like everyone else (I started watching kids when I was 8, babysitting and earning $ at 11 and basically had to give up a lot of joy in HS, college, young 20s and mid 20s due to responsibilities, emotional abuse, trauma, Covid and a serious injury - so I would get a month or two at a time to have joy and then that stopped to go back to working and focusing on problems 24/7 until a year or so later where I had joy again for a month or two. In addition, you‚Äôre expected to ‚Äúwork first, play later‚Äù but what if the work doesn‚Äôt end? Really common in the US. I didn‚Äôt learn how to value fun over work, and it‚Äôs eye opening. 
4) I live in the US and people are expected to give up their lives for their kids. I think I have a more Mediterranean and island mindset where I want my future kids to be a part of my life, not put above it (not talking about neglect - I‚Äôm big on therapy and child psychology). People hang with their friends AND kids. Everyone comes together as a community. I want this. I hate how in the US, everyone splits off. It‚Äôs too lonely. Through these comments, it‚Äôs been eye opening and helped with my anxiety
5) huge wake up call from the comments - I don‚Äôt think people in the US have fun anymore??? It‚Äôs too much work and no or little play being normalized. I love how parents in the 70s hosted parties at their home or how so many other countries celebrate life with friends and family together in a giant community. I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeking tbh and thinking of that makes the thought of having kids in my 30s more bearable.  "
"Does anyone else have an overwhelming internal narrative? If I am not speaking out loud then it is as if there is a radio in my head. Songs I don‚Äôt even necessarily like, utterly random thoughts, stringing together narratives about the most inane or serious things. I have always known this as a symptom of, or certainly a contributor to, my anxiety. 

Do you experience this? How do you manage it? I understand that some people do not even hear an internal voice in their heads and instead think in more abstract images, which sounds bizarre but peaceful to me.

For me, I have failed a PhD as I simply could not sit and write because as I say it is as if there are two versions of me speaking in my head. So I‚Äôm interested if anyone else who deals with anxiety also relates to this."
"I'm a chronic catastrophizer, and for just about any situation that pops up I will immediately launch to the worst case scenario. Even worse though, I will make up scenarios about things that literally haven't or won't happen and get extremely anxious and stressed about these things, even though I know full well that these things haven't happened or won't happen.

Right now I'm thinking of one as I type, and even though I know it won't happen I can already feel my heart rate going up.

Is anybody else like this?"
"I always feel extra anxious in the summer, I think it‚Äôs because all the sun and happy people make me feel wrong for being so uptight. I always relax more in the fall, where I notice life seems to slow down, rain makes people more inclined to stay in, and I feel like my internal feelings ‚Äúmatch‚Äù my surroundings more. Does anyone else feel like this? Just a random thought, as I have observed that it‚Äôs raining a lot today and looks to be shifting towards fall weather, and I feel delightfully neutral at work."
"something was said to me yesterday that really made me think. what‚Äôs that you say? what was said? 

i‚Äôll tell you.

 ‚Äúpeople notice you get stressed out and nervous very easily. don‚Äôt let it show.‚Äù

 it‚Äôs just a couple words yes. people may say, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt overthink it too much‚Äù ‚Äúwork on it‚Äù ‚Äúwhy would you let that bother you?‚Äù well. i‚Äôll tell you why. 

i‚Äôve struggled with anxiety for a long time. i get nervous over the smallest of situations. hence me being nervous, leads to me getting stressed because i overthink the situation. ‚Äújust don‚Äôt overthink the situation, it‚Äôs a simple task.‚Äù my mind feels like it‚Äôs going 100+ mph all day. if i make one little mistake in what i‚Äôm doing, i feel like i‚Äôve failed. trying to keep customers happy with a smile on my face while inside my head i‚Äôm talking myself down, overthinking what i did, ect.. i‚Äôm trying to teach myself to just take a breath and fix the error. it‚Äôs not as easy as you think. i try to avoid conflict and confrontation but sometimes it upsets customers/staff even though i really am trying my hardest to keep it together. 

people ask me, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you take pills for your anxiety?‚Äù ‚Äúyou should smoke for your anxiety.‚Äù 

i‚Äôm terrified to take pills again. i used to be on them. doctors messed with my doses to ‚Äúfind what dose is right for you.‚Äù it literally made me crazy. beyond irritable all the time, constantly depressed, i never wanted to get out of bed. i had trouble keeping my spaces clean. i had no motivation. don‚Äôt get me wrong, pills may help in the future but as of right now, i don‚Äôt feel it is the best choice for me. smoking helps with my anxiety a lot actually. some people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right, others do. many many jobs drug test. i can‚Äôt be smoking to help myself. 

people may not think much of it when they tell people things like this, but it affects us who are struggling quite a bit. it makes us think we‚Äôre failing and that it‚Äôs noticeable to absolutely everybody. some customers have been very understanding, others not so much. 

being told that people notice your anxiety/stress is not the best thing to hear when you‚Äôve been dealing with it for so long. trying different doses of medications for them to not really work for you. it‚Äôs upsetting but you just gotta deal with it pretty much.

"I‚Äôve had anxiety for years, probably my whole life. Most days I just feel like I can‚Äôt relax. If I‚Äôm relaxed for a bit, it doesn‚Äôt take much for me to get stressed and on edge again. I also recently got an ADHD diagnosis. I am curious what has helped your generalized anxiety the most? I don‚Äôt want to get rid of my anxiety, I just want to feel calm more often than not."
"I have been taking this drug for over a year. Last month, I took 10mg of lorazepam and basically lost consciousness. I sleepwalked through work for the next two days without any memory of what happened and when I regained my consciousness, I found out that I have taken 42 pills during that 2-day span. 3 days later I suddenly passed out at work and was sent to the hospital. The doctor suspected that I had a seizure because I bit my tougue. I am discharged now and haven‚Äôt taken any lorazepam since then but it is hard. My anxiety level is at all time high. I am completely dysfunctional in life. My life is a mess. I don‚Äôt know what to do besides sitting on the couch crying all day."
"it doesn‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense to be hit with a wave of exhaustion while you‚Äôre also freaking out. Currently im heading somewhere im SO anxious about, my heart is racing, but i feel like i could fall asleep while driving"
"Since my panic attack during December last year, I am a totally different person. Right now I only suffered from de realization, but I also fear just interpreting or analyzing all the things my eyes observed, idk if it is a psychoses or anything. But I am just afraid of things that before I was not afraid of, such reality I think. Just trying to process all the information that my eyes or reality offers is overwhelming."
"I don't know if it's my meds or what making me feel this way, but I often wake up with anxiety. Some days it's so much I gag and want to vomit but there's nothing in my stomach. 

I'm on an SSRI, antipsychotic, a seretonin modulator, and atenolol. Seroquel as needed for anxiety but that's temporary. 

I've been told I'm bipolar but I'm not sure that's right. "
"Anxious mums... Did you suddenly feel ready one day, when previously you were not?

I feel my biological clock ticking but the thought of carrying a baby and giving birth makes me SO anxious. My boyfriend often says he wishes he could take the burden off me and do it for us lol.

Even pap smears scare me; I'm a weakling with pain.

My boyfriend is 34; I'm worried about his age also. He wanted to be a young dad lol that ship sailed.

Having a little family would be pretty nice though. Everyone tells me I'd make such a good mum...

Edit: AHHH, I didn't even think of all the cervix checks along the way approaching labour! I've heard they are BAD. OUCH."
"For me it helped but only temporarily. Anytime I wasn't using it. It was much worse.

I‚Äôm 37m 3 weeks ago had to go to the hospital while there they found lesions in my lungs. I recently had a PET scan which confirmed the lesions/masses in my lungs and they found more in my lower abdomen.

How do you tell your family that you might die/ have an expiration date? The only person who knows is my fianc√©e. Sorry if this is all over the place but I‚Äôm kinda having a panic attack. Thanks in advance for reading 
"I got every test on my heart done, done multiple cardiologist visits and been to the ER.

My fucking heart keeps skipping and thats whats giving me anxiety, not the other way around. They keep telling me my heart is healthy and there‚Äôs nothing wrong but I still keep fucking getting them. I want them to fucking stop. They always tell me it‚Äôs anxiety or dehydration but I think I drink good enough. I expressed my SVT concerns (I don‚Äôt have SVT but scared I may have it.) because my heart has gone to 200bpm in a few episodes and instantly gone down back to normal. My parents are sick of it telling me theres nothing wrong with me. I‚Äôm 17 and I am at my wits end. I want these skipped beats to fucking stop. I am at my wits end."
"I often worry that I will never live a normal 'successful' life since I deal with anxiety daily. But it gives me some hope and makes me feel better when I hear stories of successful people who also struggle like me.

"I seen a post yesterday about hobbies and it got me thinking about what we do to calm anxiety.

"It is currently 12:30AM, I have been tossing and turning thinking about how my mom (60) and my dad (53) are not going to be here.

I love them so much and the thought of them not being here makes me miserable and depressed.

Same thing with time itself. I will never be this young again. My whole life is going to get slower and slower. This is my prime of my life, i am 17 years old. Nothing is going to get better than my life now I fear. It‚Äôs like my whole puzzle is connected but soon some parts will be missing. Which haunts me every single night.

Does anybody have anything to help me with this fear? Is it a phobia? If so, what is it called."

"I know the title is weird, but it happens to me in times where i'm extremely anxious and depressed : when i wake up and my bedroom it's already 9am or 10am and it's super sunny and my bedroom is drenched in light, i feel extremely anxious and scared, it's like the light scares me.
Does it happen to anyone else ?
I thought may be it's because i am unemployed and struggling with employment and waking up to this sun knowing i am not progressibg in life feels me with anxiety and stress, and makes me feel i'm disconnected from the rest of society and falling behind.
But even when i am unemployed i don't feel as anxious or stressed out when i wake up and it's still dark outside.
Is there some kind os anxiety that's related to seeing this much light when i wake up ?"

"For those who suffer from GAD, how did you know that your anxiety had gotten to a point where you needed to take medication? 

I am 20F and feel as though my anxiety is getting worse year by year. I have never sought professional help, and have lied on the GAD-7 that my doctor administers every year. I know I worry irrationally, and I do it much more than the average person and this causes me various physiological symptoms. 

What should I do? 

EDIT: thank you so much to everyone who responded. I continue to read each and every reply and I now realize I was not alone in many of the feelings that anxiety has made me suffer through. I want to live my life my way and I slowly will work on talking to my doctor about anxiety medications, and/or therapies or vitamin deficiencies that may be causing my symptoms. Thank you!"
"Hi I‚Äôm 21F and a dental assistant, I was cleaning and accidentally got pricked a little in my knuckle with a used needle through my latex glove. It made a very very tiny dot that when I squeezed had blood come out a little. The patients medical history is clear but who really knows right?? I poured alcohol on it and put on a bandaid. My boss told me I was fine but after discussing with co workers I decided to go to the hospital. The doctor I saw basically asked me what I wanted to do. Apparently there is an anti viral medication u can take for a month (but it makes u very sick with stomach pain) and that can prevent u getting anything. However he suggested to see if the patient who‚Äôs needle pricked me to do bloodwork and if he‚Äôs clear then I‚Äôm fine and don‚Äôt need the meds. Unfortunately I‚Äôm not sure if the patient will be willing to do that:( I am caught up on all vaccinations. Im very stressed and scared I‚Äôm not sure what to do.


EDIT: I went to the doctor who referred me to a positive care clinic that specializes in this stuff. I just left the apt with the doctor there and he says because of how minor the prick was and the location (on my knuckle) that he says the odds of me getting something r next to zero and it was likely salvia on the needle not blood. He did not want me to take the meds.
 

EDIT #2: My work did get in touch with the patient. He said he didn‚Äôt have anything to disclose to us. He said he got bloodwork last week as a checkup and hasn‚Äôt heard back. He refused going to get more bloodwork (I‚Äôm in Canada btw) and basically just said he hasn‚Äôt heard back from the dr about the recent bloodwork he had. Unfortunately that‚Äôs the only info I could get- he‚Äôs not the friendliest.

"Stupid question, probably, but I've been trying to exercise more to help get myself moving and do it with a purpose. That being said, I have terrible health anxiety, and I have a fear that if I exercise 'too hard' something bad will happen (heart, etc.). 

Does anyone else have this problem? If you do, what did you do to get over it/manage it? I'm trying to take things slow (treat AGGRESSIVE cleaning like exercise), but I want to move past this &amp; work on lifting heavier weights, doing more cardio because it's good for you, etc. "
"I know everyone experiences anxiety differently, so for example when I‚Äôm anxious, it gets hard to breathe, my hands get clammy, I get SUPER shaky, sometimes I get lightheaded/dizzy, and I constantly everyday feel that pit feeling in my stomach/chest/throat.
I assume that‚Äôs pretty normal though.
Are your symptoms more severe or more mild?"
"I can give more info if needed, but long story short, my 13yo daughter has been in an anxiety spiral for a month now. We've struggled with her anxiety since at least 2nd grade, but this is one of the worst occurrences I've seen. Hormonal changes definitely aren't helping, but she's barely functioning. She's not sleeping, catastrophizing, obsessively checking her pulse, thinking she's dying all the time, scared she won't wake up, eating nothing for a few days and then eating too much, constantly dizzy, feels like her throat is closing up, etc. 

It's like having a newborn again, but with a mental health crisis. 

Her doctor changed her medication from an as needed one to Prozac, we're a little over 3 weeks in on that, no progress yet but I do understand it can take 4+ weeks. 

She has an IEP, receives behavioral health services through school (her school psychologist was previously her outside therapist, we got lucky there, she adores her), has approved intermittent attendance until December if needed. Her doctor and the psychologist don't know what else to suggest to help her, though neither has mentioned admitting her. 

I can't leave her side, she's been sleeping in our room almost every single night for a month, despite trying to take baby steps to get her back in her room. Nighttime is the worst, she just keeps repeating things over and over and over for hours despite attempts at redirection. We're all exhausted and nothing is improving. She doesn't even know what is bothering her specifically, she's just in fight or flight non-stop. 

Baking cookies has been one of the only things that has kept her distracted. The only time she sleeps for more than a couple of hours is if we give her sleeping pills. We've done breathing exercises, meditation, had her write things out, ask her about random things to distract her from the negative thoughts, anything we can think of to help her break the cycle. Still not seeing any improvement. It seems to be getting even worse. 

I feel absolutely helpless. I don't know what else to do for her. She keeps saying she no longer wants to live like this, but hasn't made any specific self harm threats. "
"For me it‚Äôs throwing up, heart attack like symptoms, tight throat and constipation. Xxx"
"I went into hospital on Tuesday. I was to have an operation on my hand under local anaesthetic. I was very nervous about this and on several occasions mentioned this to hospital staff and asked if they could give me anything for my nerves, maybe a diazepam or something. I was repeatedly told no. Maybe they thought this was problem drug seeking behaviour? Everybody brushed off my feelings of nervousness which was making it worse. Finally I get into the operating room and they start to get to work injecting my hand with the anaesthetic and so forth. All of a sudden, I can‚Äôt breathe, I‚Äôm panicking, screaming and crying. It was so bad they stuck the oxygen on me. I told them I was going to pass out and went to dizzy. I was screaming stop touching me, stop the operation, I withdraw my consent. The poor surgeon tried to hold my hand and I accused her of continuing the operation. They had to cancel my op halfway through. After I could start to breathe more and a lie down I broke down to the surgical team crying and apologising. This isn‚Äôt the first panic attack at hospital for a minor procedure. I don‚Äôt know how to stop this. It‚Äôs completely involuntary. I feel so pathetic I‚Äôm a grown woman pushing 30. I am my own worst enemy. The surgeon wrote me a letter to take to my GP instructing her to get me on some stronger medication and has put me on waiting list for general anaesthetic. I feel like such a failure."
Curious to hear if there's anything you wish your family or friends knew about what it's like to experience anxiety.
"It depends for me. Caffeine for instance worsens anxiety while alcohol seems to relieve it. 

It say weed is in the middle where it doesn't help nor worsen the anxiety."
"Doctors keep handing me endless anti depressants saying that it will help with my anxiety, but I can‚Äôt even think about how many I‚Äôve tried! It seems like I‚Äôm best to stick with my benzodiazepine and maybe something like buspar but I don‚Äôt think that the SSRIs SNRIs help much at all. In fact it makes me even more anxious to think about how many of them I‚Äôve put in my body and have changed my brain chemistry. 
So, what do y‚Äôall think? I hope I‚Äôm wrong!"

What anxiety ruined for me is food, I can‚Äôt eat certain foods because of texture and sensations I‚Äôm uncomfortable with and it gets worse with anxiety.

"So I went to the hospital last night but I wasn't planning on actually going inside.  I felt the panic ""heart attack"" symptoms so I drove there as calmly as I could and just parked there.  I sat there for like 45 mins just watching my heart rate on my watch and chilling trying to wait it out and really wanting to just go home.  It's what I wanted more than anything in the world.  lol .

And there was this ambulance there that just got done checking someone in.  And they had their headlights facing me and they chilled there watching me making sure I didn't have a seizure or somethin cause I guess they noticed me.  And then it got worse so I walked inside to the lobby and just sat down in there and the ambulance left.  I told the lady there I didn't wanna check in and that I was just having a panic attack and I just felt safe waiting there and she said ok.  Apparently the nurses were watching me through the cameras in there. I lasted like 20 min in the waiting room before I felt like I was dying so I gave in and checked in to the emergency room -_-

I was in the emergency room for maybe 30 mins before the doctor came in and promptly discharged me saying my vitals were fine and that I should see a counselor and start taking aratrax.  Man I knew it was a waste of money to even check in but it's like my brain wouldn't accept that I was physically okay without being told that by a professional.  It is ridiculous.

But anyway it was nice to know they were watching me incase I like collapsed or something.  And they were all really kind to me.  But man my brain is so frustrating like why couldn't I have lasted 30 more minutes and avoided the fucking check in!  I don't get it. 

 I just started having these panic attacks at 28 years old by the way.  I never had anxiety until my mid 20s then it's like a switch flipped and life just seems like a chore instead of exciting and fun.  I am over 2 years sober from alcohol and almost 4 years clean from Phenibut.  Anyway I just felt like ranting to someone because I don't want anyone in my actual life to know about my mental problems."

I'm mostly just angry about the fact I'm having one at all. "
It‚Äôs been pretty cold the past few weeks since winter was ending. Now that it‚Äôs like 80 degrees outside I hate it.

Edit: Thank you guys, so much. You've made me feel much better. I love you all."
"So tonight i was at work and around 6pm i felt my blood sugar get low. It‚Äôs been an issue for me my whole life and ive also been struggling to eat lately, but that‚Äôs unrelated. 

I knew I was leaving work at 7 and was driving home so I needed to get my blood sugar in check before I left. So I got 2 cokes and a reeces. (All my vending machine had lol)

But that was all it took for me to get anxious about the idea of me having a medical emergency behind the wheel. My mom did when I was 11 when she had a seizure behind the wheel and we both almost died. 

So when I left work I got about ten minutes down the road and had to pull over. Still thinking it was only my blood sugar I pulled over at the gas station and got a Gatorade and a banana. Started to feel better so I left to go home finally.

Well another 10 minutes down the road and my hands are tingling‚Ä¶ oh no. Now I get the claw hands and I am barely able to pull into someone‚Äôs driveway. I call 911 because I don‚Äôt know what else to do. 

They get there and check my blood sugar. It‚Äôs fine. My blood pressure, however, is through the roof. My pulse is insane. So they say it‚Äôs a panic attack, and I know it is. But damn. 

The truth is I did have low blood sugar. And I corrected it. But the fear of driving with low blood sugar was enough to set off a panic attack‚Ä¶ even if I didn‚Äôt recognize it. 

Also, I was NOT hyperventilating when my hands locked up. So that confused me. They always say the ‚Äúclaw hands‚Äù are from hyperventilating. The paramedics said I probably wasn‚Äôt breathing correctly even if I didn‚Äôt realize it. 

After they told me my blood sugar was okay, I was able to drive home. So I knew it was the anxiety from potentially having a medical emergency behind the wheel‚Ä¶ and that in and of itself‚Ä¶ CAUSED an emergency behind the wheel. 

Now I‚Äôm spiraling even worse because I HAVE to drive. And I‚Äôm scared again. Usually I can FEEL a panic attack coming on and either stop it or get somewhere safe. But this time? It felt like something different.

"Hi everyone! I recently took a sick leave from my work because it was being too much, and I felt like I lost myself trying to ‚Äúfit‚Äù into a lifestyle that was going way too fast for me.

I see this as an opportunity to rediscover myself, BE myself. And above all adopt a slower lifestyle that my mind and body could support. Along the way, I fell back in love with gaming, and above all the ‚ÄúLife is Strange‚Äù franchise. Just finished the 3rd, I identified SO MUCH with the character and I love this type of gaming with a nice storytelling, where you can go at your own pace. It is very therapeutic and brought me a lot of peace in this difficult moment.

I‚Äôm currently giving Life is Strange 2 a try, but I would love to know if there‚Äôs any game that shares common points with it. Sooooo here‚Äôs for my fellow ‚Äúanxious/nerdy‚Äù friends. I‚Äôd like to find games that:

- Have a nice storytelling
- Where you‚Äôre not ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to fight against enemies or destroy people
- Where you can go at your own pace, no time pressure
- The multiple-choice part is also VERY cool

NB: I play on PS5, Switch and (soon) PC

"So I just left Walmart with my family, and by the time we were leaving I was having a full blown anxiety attack.
As soon as I walked in I started feeling like shit, I swear they put the horrific fluorescent lights to make you disoriented like a deer in headlights so you buy more shit. As I walked around I started feeling worse and worse, and as we approached self checkout it got to the fucking pinacle. TWO DIFERENT self checkout sections, complete with their symphony of ear-bleeding beeps, different smells and utter chaos. 
Not to mention we bought a bunch of stuff, and what makes a Walmart trip without an error at the self checkout machine? Thank GOD it got resolved quickly, because by the end I couldn't control my breathing and was freaking out. Also I don't know if anyone else gets this but when I get nervous i start laughing and it's really uncomfortable and hard to stop

"For the past couple of weeks, almost every night when I'm drifting off to sleep, my thoughts uncontrollably gravitate to the idea of death. It's the same thought process every time, and it always ends with the final thought of ""what if nothing comes after death?"" After that thought, every time, I  just instantly start panicking, going from 0 to 100. I get instant anxiety, trouble breathing, my heart starts beating faster, and a sudden need to just run away appears. I usually have to jog around a bit and take deep breaths for a few minutes before I calm down. It's really bothering me because it mostly happens at nighttime and it's stopping me from sleeping. I've gotten better at handling the immediate panic, but it still always wakes me up. Does anyone have the same anxieties or any advice?

I‚Äôve never noticed it to cause me actual symptoms, instead I would just ruminate on body sensations (I.e: pain in my chest was a heart attack, headache was a stroke.) 

In October I was not experiencing any heath anxiety, but I was studying all month for a very important exam and also going through alot of stress at my job. One night when I laid down for sleep I had a heart palpitation which felt like a big thump. They continued all night long at least once a minute. They were gone when I woke up, I took my exam and passed that week and thought everything was fine. Then they came back the next week, same deal as soon as I got in bed. I had about 5 more similar episodes over the next month. I cut out caffeine (I would drink 1-3 coffees a day), cut out alcohol and increased my water intake dramatically (I was always dehydrated). None of that seemed to make a difference so one night I went to get an EKG for my own piece of mine which looked completely normal. I then made an appointment with my doctor, but my palpitations mysteriously disappeared before my appointment. My doctor did some blood work and I had a holter monitor for 48 hours. My blood work was fine and the holter monitor showed some PVCs and PACs but still &lt;1% of total heartbeats. My doctor wasn‚Äôt that concerned but offered to refer me to a cardiologist if I wanted. Given that they had stopped, I decided not to. 

Now I feel like they are all I think about. I haven‚Äôt had an episode since November, however I now notice at least 1-5 palpitations daily. Sometimes it feels like flutters, others an extra beat. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly focusing on my heartbeat and waiting to feel one. I have slowly introduced caffeine back into my life, I‚Äôm not drinking as much as I used too but I haven‚Äôt noticed that it causes me any heart palpitations. Same with alcohol. I‚Äôve also noticed that if I‚Äôm doing something fun, I don‚Äôt notice having any at all (which makes me think they‚Äôre all anxiety related.) I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôm sick of thinking about them all day, I‚Äôm sick of spiraling the second I feel one and I‚Äôm sick of being afraid to get in bed at night worried it‚Äôs going to trigger an all night long episode again. I think I am going to go to the cardiologist after all just to hopefully ease my mind. In the meantime though, has anyone dealt with something similar and if so what has helped you?"

"I‚Äôm having an AA right now. I don‚Äôt know who to speak with, it feels like a lot of pressure right now. Can‚Äôt breathe normally, can‚Äôt focus on anything, can‚Äôt do shit right now. I feel so messed up and I have terrible thoughts right now, that tells me how of a bad person I am, lazy, bad boyfriend and friend, bad student. I just really don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs dumb to text here, I‚Äôm sorry, I just really need to talk about it"
How many people have wanted to go to hospital for anxiety because it makes you feel so awful . 
"My anxiety comes and goes, but I‚Äôm having a particularly anxious day. If you are too, you‚Äôre not alone. "
"I haven‚Äôt left my house since Christmas of 2022 after being assaulted. But today is the day. I‚Äôve been working with a therapist for the past four months and today is the day. I‚Äôm leaving my safety net and traversing the wild to get to the dentist. I haven‚Äôt slept and I‚Äôm really not feeling well physically but I‚Äôm going to pull through. I‚Äôm going to actually leave. Because today is the day.

Edit: I know it‚Äôs just comments on a post between strangers online but no one‚Äôs ever told me they‚Äôre proud of me before. You guys make me want to keep going. I love you all and I hope you find a forgotten $20 bill in the pocket of a pair of pants you washed so you can buy yourself a little treat."
"My anxiety is all over the place, I feel either guilty, or the whole world is going to end. I‚Äôm in a weird stage in my life and there‚Äôs a lot of change going on. I‚Äôm trying to keep my composure but sometimes I get headaches and stomach issues. I haven‚Äôt felt ok for about a month now, I‚Äôm losing my fucking mind."
I stopped drinking coffee for a few years because I started a job where I didn't have to get up so early. Tried 5 or 6 times in the past month and each time it sends me into an immediate high-heart rate private freakout. Anxiety is fucking evil. It's robbing me of all of the little things in life that I used to enjoy. It's like a piano dangling over my head everywhere I go.
"My chest is super tight, and my breathing is rapid, and I just can't relax. I'm trying to read a book, but it's hard to focus when my body is so tense, lol. Does anybody have any tips on how to calm the physical side effects of anxiety?"
"So I have no problem smoking a vape and most of the times I'm fine with edibles. 

24 hours ago I took a 10mg delta 9 gummy. 

I have now been high for 26 hours. Over night I was pouring sweat, couldn't use my legs, thought I was going to die. 

Now the next night I'm still slightly dizzy, extremely tired and brain fog. 

Anyone experience this or am I freaking out. Man. "
"Just had a big work meeting where I had to present my work to 10 of my supervisors and I had to take 120 mg of propranolol (it‚Äôs really a lot I know). Well I talked for one hour and a half without issues, people complimented me. Usually I shake and cry. 

This is the best invention ever. Too bad that I am so sleepy now and I still have 6 hours of work to do üòÖ"
"Hey guys, so I have a presentation tomorrow in front of 140 students, and have pretty bad performance anxiety, I shake and my heart races etc. I have 10mg propranolol tablets to take beforehand but I‚Äôm so scared to take one (I have health anxiety, specifically cardiophobia lol). My heart rate generally sits in the 60s and sometimes the high 50s (I‚Äôm 20 and exercise regularly). 
I‚Äôm basically just convinced it‚Äôs going to stop my heart/ make it super slow so it‚Äôs a medical emergency.
But I know I‚Äôll be SUPER anxious for the presentation since it‚Äôs in front of so many people. Pls help me üò≠

Edit:
Just had the presentation and took the propranolol beforehand. It went really well and I spoke basically as if I was just having a normal conversation! It was crazy how calm I felt when I‚Äôd usually be a nervous wreck.
Can‚Äôt recommend propranolol enough!!"
"I need to know if anyone ever the same sort of experience on weed. I used to smoke all the time until once I took a massive eddible it caused a massive panic attack, the panic attack it‚Äôs self lasted for about 5 hours which isn‚Äôt normal but throughout I was experiencing painful pains that was not there for example my stomach started felling like it was ripping from the outside I couldn‚Äôt lift any part of my body up as it felt like I could feel all the blood in my body everytime I closed my eyes a massive shake went to my brain felt like I was getting electrocuted it gave me a severe hypochondria about dying and now every time I smoke the exact same feelings happen and I instantly get a panic attack I quit like a year ago but want to learn more or know if this happened to anyone else?

"I‚Äôm not really talking about diarrhea or loose stools, I know those can be caused by extreme anxiety.  But what about just pooping normal poops more often than you used to?  Or maybe even softer poop?  Dr. Google causes anxiety about this."
"Every pain, every abnormality, and I think cancer. Or a brain aneurysm. Or a heart attack. 

It‚Äôs been destroying my life and taking over my thoughts so heavily recently. I can‚Äôt keep doing this. I‚Äôve been to therapy. I‚Äôve been on meds since I was 14, and im 25 now. Nothing helps me. I‚Äôll be having fun and im out of the vibe"

"That‚Äôs all.

I work in a coffee shop and I LOVE coffee. But if I have too much caffeine, especially espresso, I will have a panic attack.

It especially sucks when I have to work early and I‚Äôm exhausted. Everyone else I work with has so many espresso shots every day, and I just wish I could have that many. I usually have decaf. I love the taste of cold brew and occasionally drink it, but it‚Äôs extremely situational because caffeine makes me so anxious.

I‚Äôve had panic attacks at work multiple times because of it and I always feel like shit when it happens. Especially around other people. I just wanna enjoy my cold brew without having a panic attack, man‚Ä¶ :((("
"
Do you know what drives me the most insane with my anxiety? How REAL it all is. 

It feels so fucking real. 

Every physical symptom is so scary and so strong it‚Äôs hard to doubt the intrusive belief that something is wrong "
"I'm 20 and never worked before. Was in special education and due to fears about not being smart enough to work I didn't search for a job. My parents pushed me to find a job and I applied at this local coffee shop. I thought it wouldn't be too bad but I had my first day and my fears were proven right. 


I started during a rush and had to multitask many different things at once. I sucked at pretty much everything. I couldn't make the drinks right and my boss kept shouting at me in front of customers which made things worse. I spilled things. I bumped into things. I couldn't even mop right. At the end of the day my boss told me she didn't think I had ""the brains"" to last and she's right. I am smart enough to know how stupid I am but that's it. "
"5 years ago I was 17/18, my friend I admired used to post promiscuous pictures of herself all the time. So I wanted to copy her and I posted a promiscuous photo of myself with half my face covered in a dark lighting saying somethingbalong the lines of ‚Äúdump dump or boobies‚Äù on my IG story, then deleted it after 5min but I noticed 100 people saw it. My IG doesn‚Äôt have my real name on it but its something close to my name ish. I wasn‚Äôt fully nude but I was wearing really small shorts and a bra. I was depressed asf and being stupid I know. It was 5 years ago but to this day I worry that someone will repost it in the future. I‚Äôm jn the finance field at a large IB firm and things are going well rn but I worry someone will send a screenshot of this to my employer. I never posted things like this again, just that day I was fking stupid asf and drunk. Do you guys think I will be fired if this was reshared? üòì

Edit: thank you guys you actually make me feel a lot better, in the back of my mind I‚Äôm still worried but I guess the chance of someone keeping it for 5+ years to come and sending to my employer and them actually firing me for it would be pretty low"
"I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 12/13, I‚Äôm now almost 22. Some days are easier than others. It‚Äôs definitely gotten better over the years. I can leave the house by myself when I never used to be able to. I can socialise in ways that I never used to be able to. But I still struggle with alot of things. I still get so much anxiety about small things. Recently I‚Äôve developed a lot of health anxiety. The minute I start to feel even a slight bit under the weather, I panic and I overthink that much that I start to feel sick and my body shakes and my heart rate increases and my breathing goes all weird. I‚Äôm currently trying to book an appointment with my GP but it‚Äôs looking like they have no availability this week. Ive never been on any medication for it, so I just wanted to ask people what medication they‚Äôve been on that has genuinely helped them and if there‚Äôs any medication I should avoid. Even if anyone could recommend vitamins or natural remedies that have helped them, it‚Äôd be much appreciated. Thank you.

"I got bit like 4 times by bugs outside taking my dog out. My brain convinced me I was going to die from being bit, and it was only a matter of time üòÇ

"After a very stressful period of my life followed by the worst panic attack on sunday and monday, every single sudden noise and movement scares me and sends me into flight mode. 

I also have health anxiety and many weird symptoms that come and go which makes me super aware of every sensation in my body. My whole body feels constantly tense. I'd like to exercise but my headaches and dizziness make it difficult. I've started fluoxetine yesterday so hopefully that will eventually help. 

Does anyone have any tips? Im desperate."
Recently ive been going through some tests. Things have been seen that are not of concern but i always think BUT WHAT IF. What if they missed something what if it is bad. My symptoms are still there yet easing. The thing is i think about death every minute every second of the day it consumes every thought every feeling it just consumes everything IM FUCKING SICK OF IT! For the last 3 weeks i have hardly left the house i have hardly eaten. I get so worried i start dry reaching i wake up numerous times a night with heart rate over 120bpm sweating and feeling fucking nauseous and just thinking IM DYING! I cry i fall down i scream i swear i have lost myself.
My first thought was on the highway but in my current state that might be bad for public safety 
Is this normal? My parents say it is.
"I feel it in in my sternum right in front, below my heart above stomach. It feels like a focused tingling, almost like a current, as if I was plugged in at that spot, and a sensation of a falling or ship rocking."
"I've had anxiety since I went to high school, and my parents are well aware. However, they don't believe in medication, so it's kind of just...festered.

The constant anxiety has bloomed into physical symptoms. I shit whenever i'm mildly nervous. I don't sleep and constantly have nightmares. I cry a lot, and I always feel like I'm trapped in fight or flight. My chest always hurts or feels like something is tugging on it. 

I hate this. I hate myself for *being* like this because I somehow feel like it's my fault. I don't go to therapy often enough for it to do anything because I have to sneak around my parents. Meditating has about a 50% success rate. Breathing exercises only temporarily work, and then the nightmares come at night and I'm back at square one.

I'm over this. I want it all to stop. "
"So I have had anxiety for as long as I know. Especially with talking in front of people I don't know. It's been really bad forever. I started streaming on Twitch and Kick just for the heck of it, thinking nobody would ever watch me play a mix of weird indie titles and the occasional Zelda run. It was just me, rambling to myself and pretending I had an audience for months. Honestly, it was more about killing time and less about getting followers or anything and I liked the ""practice"" of talking to people. 

But then, slowly, something awesome happened. People actually started showing up. At first, it was just a random viewer popping in and out, but eventually, I got this little crew of about ten folks who regularly hang out in my streams. And let me tell you, this small but mighty group has been a game-changer for my confidence. 

Chatting with them, sharing my gameplay, and just being my awkward self has seriously boosted my confidence. It's like I've found this little corner of the internet where I can be me, and it's helped me deal with my speaking anxiety big time. Who knew talking to strangers while failing at platformers could do that, right?

For anyone out there feeling anxious about speaking or just interacting with people, maybe give streaming a shot. It's not about how many people show up... and having no one show up in the beginning really helped me. It's about finding your vibe and the few who dig it. It's been a wholesome ride for me, and honestly, it's made me a lot more comfortable with myself."
"Hi 

My girlfriend is a very anxious person. She has been having a few panic attacks recently.

Often she'd call me, but i know that I'm not always going to be available for her to talk to. So I've decided to record a voice note. I'll program it to her Apple watch, she can then tap and listen to it anytime.

I'm preparing 2-3 min script for this. Now I want to know what a person wants to hear when they go through a panic attack. This is my plan so far -

- Gentle intro (say her name)
- ask her to focus on nothing else for 2 mins except this voice message
- tell her to breathe
- assurance that it's going to be okay (a lot)
- highlight her good qualities, compliment her looks
- pep talk (like you go girl but a little sensitive)

I'm planning to record a normal one and a funny one.

Thanks in advance for helping me with my script. :)"
Or is it the sense of seeing others share your experiences that helps on this sub?
"I‚Äôll go first. Back in November I was heading back to my house after dropping off some friends. I suddenly had a horrible heat flash out of no where and my hands started going numb. This was terrifying since I was driving at night, and I was still about 10 minutes from being home. I had to pull over because my entire body went numb and I entered a really bad derealization episode. I was 100% sure I was dying because I literally could not breathe and it felt like my lungs had collapsed. I became insanely nauseous and was super close to throwing up, but luckily I didn‚Äôt. There wasn‚Äôt even a specific trigger that I can pinpoint, which is honestly super frustrating. I had several panic attacks that have brought me similar symptoms, but this was definitely the worst since I was alone and it was around 10 PM. Panic attacks can be SO scary and make you feel like you are dying. They are literally the worst.

What was your guys‚Äôs worst panic/anxiety attack?

"Hi everyone. I‚Äôve been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks for 2 years. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with ptsd, anxiety and panic disorder. I‚Äôve been on sertaline, mirtazapine, paroxetine and propranolol for panic attacks. I was on sertaline the longest, 250 for around a year. I hated mirtazapine and paroxetine. My doctor told me to stop taking propranolol because she suspects I have asthma, had a test in April still waiting for results. The past two days I‚Äôve had to take my propranolol because my panic attacks have been so bad. It‚Äôs been making me tight chested but I literally couldn‚Äôt have coped without it. 

I have an appointment with my doctor Monday, I‚Äôm sure I have something undiagnosed. I‚Äôve been dissociating, really bad intrusive thoughts. I‚Äôm going to discuss going back on medication so I‚Äôm just wondering, what medication really worked for you? I‚Äôm terrified of taking medication hence why I haven‚Äôt taken any since sometime last year but right now I really need it. Thank you!  

Edit: Would just like to add, I know everyone is different with side effects. I think I have terrible health anxiety so I‚Äôm worried about side effects and hearing other people‚Äôs side effects will just help me feel less alone!! "
"Please tell I am not alone in this‚Ä¶ Today I had a virtual check up with my doctor.

I get really anxious talking to doctors and even more anxious when I have to talk about my problems (with essentially a stranger).

"Hi, I‚Äôm 22 and for the last 4 months my mind has been harassing me with the feeling that I‚Äôm going to die this year. I don‚Äôt want too. I‚Äôm scared and I want to stop feeling like this. I didn‚Äôt feel like this 4th months ago. Maybe I should explain that I‚Äôve been around death a lot. My mom died when I was 15 and my dad when I was 19. Two months later after my dad, my fianc√©s mom died. I was the one who called 911 and held her up as she went into a coma. She died 4 days later. In may 2023 my uncle passed away suddenly. Then in September, my coworker gets sick and passes away just hours after I see her. 

I think it was after that I started to feel that way and think about it. I had goals for myself in 2024 back in summer 2023 and after all that, I‚Äôve just been feeling like I‚Äôm going to die soon."

"I want to cut out caffeine to lessen my anxiety, but I'm literally falling asleep at work. I get 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night (not necessarily uninterrupted) and more on the weekends. Even on good sleep, I'm draggin ass. Help?"
"Hey everyone, just wanted to take a minute to write on here to just to you to have hope and that things will get better. I know if you‚Äôre suffering with any kind of anxiety, you‚Äôll be sick and tired of hearing this, I was the same but it‚Äôs true.

A little about me, around a year and a half ago I was your standard 25 year old (M) I enjoyed going to the gym, hanging out with friends any chance I got, I worked full time and didn‚Äôt have a care in the world. Then basically overnight my world turned upside down. I had a panic attack whilst at home, nothing caused it and I‚Äôd never had one before so I didn‚Äôt have any idea what was happening to me and I freaked. I went from being me to not being able to leave the house for 5months, off work for 8 months and not being able to see friends and family for the longest of time. I would lie in bed for hours with this impending feeling of dread.

However 1.5 years one I can happily say things are much better, I‚Äôm back at work full time, I‚Äôm able to see friends again. Managed to get to my best friends wedding and I‚Äôm able to do things that a year and a half ago were impossible!

I‚Äôll list a few things below that I wish people would have told me when I was going through it and even if just one of you can relate and feels a bit better after reading this, then I‚Äôll know my suffering was worth it so that I can help others.

- Doctors can only do so much but they know what they‚Äôre talking about even when it seems like they don‚Äôt. The amount of times l left the doctors feeling frustrated that they‚Äôd not answered anything and I was still just at perplexed as before was ridiculous. Which takes me to point 2.

- Anxiety makes no sense. It‚Äôs almost impossible to rationalise something so irrational. Any symptom you can think of, anxiety can cause. To this day I still don‚Äôt understand how anxiety can cause chest pains, aches or anything but that‚Äôs okay.

- No anxiety is the same, just like no 2 people are the same. There was countless times when people who suffered with anxiety were telling me how they coped with it and because that wasn‚Äôt working, I was adamant I didn‚Äôt have anxiety and there was something else wrong with me which wasn‚Äôt the case. Just because something works for one person doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll work for you, it‚Äôs all about finding out which technique works for yourself. For example, breathing techniques never really worked for me.

- Medication. Extending on from my last point a little more, each person is different in which medication works for them. I tried 3 different types of medication before finding the one that was right for me. I see a lot of people on here use propranolol which works for them (which I‚Äôm happy for them about!) but that never worked for me, and that‚Äôs okay! 

- Counselling. It works! Don‚Äôt be embarrassed to get help and don‚Äôt let your pride/ego get in the way of getting better. I used to be the same, thought counselling was for crazy people but I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong (as long as you get a good counsellor). They help in ways that doctors can‚Äôt. They help break down all the symptoms you‚Äôre feeling and can show you what causes them which helps put your mind at ease and sometimes it‚Äôs nice to just be able to unload all your feelings to someone. 

- How tiring and boring anxiety is. No one ever mentions how exhausting it is having your body on fight or flight mode all time and how boring life becomes when you‚Äôre stuck inside all day not being able to leave. Some days, you‚Äôre so exhausted by it that it‚Äôs easier to let the anxiety win and that‚Äôs okay. As long as the next day you get back up and you challenge it again.

- Timeline. Just like in life, every person is on a different timeline. Some people can bounce back quicker than others and some take a little longer. I know it‚Äôs frustrating and I know it‚Äôs tiring but trust the process!

- You are not alone. Anxiety is extremely isolating and at times it feels like you‚Äôre the one person in the world that it‚Äôs happening to. But there is people out there who are going through the same and as horrible as it sounds, I took comfort in reading through these threads and knowing I wasn‚Äôt the only one suffering.

- My last point and the most important one. YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE. Anxiety fucking sucks and it feels like you are letting everyone down but that‚Äôs not the case. The mind is so incredibly complex and it‚Äôs just about training your mind again to think a certain way. The only thing everyone close to you cares about is you getting better and you will! You will always be the last one to notice how much better you‚Äôre getting.

Apologies for this going on a bit, I didn‚Äôt mean for it to drag on but you can do this! I‚Äôm living proof that things get better and even in the darkest days, try not to lose hope and trust the process. It‚Äôs going to take time, just keep taking loads of little steps and you‚Äôll get there. I have faith in you and I know you can do it! Love you all ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I had a traumatic experience where I had to go to the hospital in an ambulance for the first time in my life 8 months ago and I felt like I was dying. Turns out nothing was wrong with me and I had a suspected panic attack.

Since that day; every single day; i feel high. i feel as if i wake up and smoke a joint but without the good parts of the high. just insane brain fog, lightheadedness, and just feeling really really spaced out. I‚Äôve had every test under the sun from brain mri‚Äôs to echocardiograms etc. everything is clear and nothing can be found.

Is this my brain stuck in a freeze response from when I was so scared? Is this what anxiety actually feels like? It seems to ease up towards nighttime but during the day it‚Äôs unbearable sometimes. any help is appreciated. "
"can anyone relate? Over the day im super anxious and I am dissociating. The sun light gives me anxiety, i get social anxiety when I know I have to talk, I wanna be alone because people steal my energy. But whenever it‚Äôs dark outside and late im getting so relaxed, I am happier and can talk to my roommates way easier without brain fog. Right now I feel like nothing can stop me and I have the power of doing something, to go out. But only during the night. Its so weird, maybe I am a vampire. Why cant I be like that during the day???"
"So mornings are the hardest for me. I recently saw someone on Reddit actually comment a helpful tip that TREMENDOUSLY helped me. 

It‚Äôs basically just accepting the anxiety &amp; saying ‚ÄúBring it on! You can chill here if you wanna but then you can head out when you wanna!!‚Äù 

Talk to your anxiety- but be nice and patient ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"My goal here is to provide some hope and insight for others that are experiencing anxiety by sharing my journey. Maybe I can just help one person that is seeking answers like I was. This isn't some quick fix, but simply what my experience was over years and maybe you can gather some useful info. This post is mainly for people that have just recently stumbled into anxiety, specifically after a drug related event, but it may help anyone.

**ABOUT ME:**  
I had what I like to call an ‚Äúon-going panic attack‚Äù for about 2 years. It all started in my senior year of college. I had never really had ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù before as I would call it now. I would certainly get nervous and anxious about exams or fears, but it was fairly minor. I would overthink stuff and have always been a bit of a hypochondriac but I would never claimed myself as an anxious person.

That was until my first panic attack. There was a lot of stressors going on my life at the time (2021)‚Ä¶ Covid, graduating college, trying to figure out what to do with my life, dating, isolation, etc. I decided that with my time in isolation during Covid that I would try edibles to help with the tough times. I was always a bit of a goody two shoes and never did any sort of drugs, and would really only drink occasionally, but at this point I was desperate. The first few times I had a lot of fun but after some time during the year I decided to take an increased dosage as I felt as though I wasn‚Äôt really having as much fun as the first time I had done it. Went from taking a usual 10mg to then deciding to take 20mg. I started to feel extremely anxious, with an overwhelming sense of dread and fear as my whole body started freaking out. This was my first panic attack. I had been playing video games at the time and was desperate to go to the ER. Felt like I was almost in a time loop and lasted for hours and maybe at least what felt like that I can‚Äôt remember. Truly the worst experience of my entire life. Over the next few days, I still felt kinda bleh, but it was something that was in the past.

**THE INCIDENT:**  
A week goes by and I‚Äôm laying in bed on my phone, when all of a sudden I‚Äôm feeling a little anxious again until I‚Äôve worked myself up about this feeling to end up having another panic attack. This time was even scarier for me, as I didn‚Äôt know WHY this was happening. At least before I knew it was the weed and it was something that happens to people. This panic however, didn‚Äôt go away. There was nothing that I was consciously thinking about to make me feel this way, I was just in this loop of being anxious about being anxious.

Days go by where this panic doesn‚Äôt subside, my whole body is shaking, and I‚Äôm alone in my apartment horrified. I end up going to the ER and they ended up giving me some fast acting anxiety medication. This is when I finally had found some small bit of peace. This debilitating anxiety had gone from an 10 to about at 8. I was no longer shaking but I will still incredibly overwhelmed. Eventually I ended up moving back home and my journey to get back to normal started.

Now this anxiety wouldn‚Äôt just come and go. It was NON-STOP. From waking up in the morning to going to bed at night there was not a single moment of peace, it was always there‚Ä¶ but I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it this was just how I was now and it was driving me to intense depression. Usually at its worst in the morning, due to your high cortisol at that time, your body is sensitive to that increase.

**DESPERATE FOR A CURE:**  
Over this time I looked into all kinds of things to fix this, looking up my symptoms and finding stories on Reddit. Many of the things I read often made me feel worse, with people talking about how they got too high once and were forever changed. I was worried I was going to develop schizophrenia and start to lose my mind and be swept away into a mental hospital. THIS HOWEVER, I‚Äôve learned sadly a little too late is something that SO MANY PEOPLE exactly think and it‚Äôs just irrational thoughts that are incredibly common.

After so much research I was convinced that  there was something wrong with my body. This anxiety isn‚Äôt due to any sort of stress, it was something wrong with my body and I just had to find some fix for it. I tried therapy, improving my gut health, exercise, meditation, allergies, journaling, blood tests, X-rays, and all kinds of other health stuff. I was so afraid that this was going to be my life forever and I really wouldn‚Äôt be able to take it much longer. Medication was my last resort.

**MEDICATION:**  
I was finally put on Buspirone (10mg?) and after weeks I felt no change. DONT LET THAT MAKE YOU LOSE HOPE. I was convinced that even medication wouldn‚Äôt be able to help me, but after adding on some other medications and increasing the dosage‚Ä¶ it finally stopped after months of trial. This ISN'T me saying that medication fixes everything, but I just know that during my time I had seen so many posts and people talking about how it didn't work for them, so I am working to show the brighter side of things.

During this time I was unemployed and living at home, but at around this time of getting on medication I started a fun job at an Escape Room place. This job I loved, the people, the work, everything. It was truly what I needed. This in tandem with the medication helped me wake up one morning and realize that I hadn‚Äôt felt anxious in some time. After almost 2 years of constant unbearable fear, I found comfort finally. I

I ended up even finding someone at work that had gone through something similar, they had the exact same thoughts that they were going to develop schizophrenia and go crazy, but now we were both enjoying life again.

**LIFE NOW:**  
I look back now and find it so frustrating that when I was searching in fear on Reddit for someone to have lived through what I had gone through and made it out okay all I could find were horror stories. People saying that they have been like this for 15 years or something like that. THAT WAS THE WORST THING TO HEAR when trying to find hope‚Ä¶ like what the hell guys that is not what someone needs to be thinking about. I think it was difficult to find good stories because often times we‚Äôre searching our negative symptoms and people post on here with their problems, with solutions being scarce.

**THINGS THAT HELPED ME:**

* Exercise. Running was the worst thing in the world for me, but hey it really does help even a little bit.
* Meditation. Working on trying to ground yourself when feeling especially rough.
* Sleepcasts. Helped me get to sleep and distract myself. (I love Rainday Antiques by Headspace)
* Headspace. Super awesome meditation stuff and framing anxiety. There‚Äôs an app but also a lot of free stuff on YouTube.
* Medication. Don‚Äôt give up!
* Environment. Surround yourself with people that support you and understand. No one else could even perceive what I was going through, but this doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre alone. I just got a fun job and focused on living in the present for a bit.
* Therapy. Even just talking out how you feel with a family or friend. Or find someone online that is similar to you.

**CONCLUSION:**  
I think the panic was something that was coming from many stressors, but the weed was the last straw. I still do have a lot of anxiety about careers and what I‚Äôd like to do with my life, and I think that‚Äôs probably where most of the stress was as I had just graduated but was mostly subconscious. Medication and my environment helped me get to a point where I felt like myself again until I didn‚Äôt need it anymore. 

Hopefully this post can help just one person that is as lost as I once was and is searching for help. If you have similar stories or advice please share them! And if you have any questions, ask away! :)

**EDIT:** Thank you everyone for sharing! There is a lot more I could write but I wanted to say that I‚Äôm not trying to frame medication as a perfect solution. For me, it helped me get my body out of this state of debilitating anxiety, where I could then work on the things that were giving me anxiety (which at the time, I didn‚Äôt think were the problem I thought my body was just ruined because of the weed).

Also want to say that if you‚Äôre reading this post years from now, feel free to still ask any questions. I know it‚Äôs rough out there, stay strong!"
"Keeping it short.who here has been in a full blown anxiety attack, or in the middle of a symptoms outbreak and you are on the border of Doom. Then your distracted by something and all your symptoms go away. Then you remember hang on I was dying a few minutes ago, then it's back üò≠"
"I have unfortunately let Doomer Redditors take me by the hand into imagining some pretty grisly scenarios now that there's a new strain of bird flu, according to the WHO.

But in an effort to slow the fuck down and not dive headfirst into an anxiety episode, let's review the facts. 

1) Bird flu strains sometimes hop from animal to human. It's rare, but this kind of thing has happened a few times already and has NOT led to a pandemic

2) There is already an ongoing bird flu situation. It's been happening for months now, and there has only been 3 confirmed cases. These were people who were directly involved with animals.

3) Despite what Reddit will have you Believe, I think the world and laypeople like you and me have learned a thing or two about living through a pandemic. IF another were to happen, I think we'd be slightly more prepared. 

4) This is all an evolving situation. We don't know a lot of stuff. Only time will tell, and time is completely out of our control. 

Feel free to add any facts or affirmations here :)"

Edit: Reading all these comments makes me feel so warm. I am at work and my presentation went okay. I still do feel a Lil anxious overall. But I think an evening run and a good sleep would make me feel better. Thank you all of you. I surely didn't expect so much support. More love to all of you!"

Advice would be appreciated"
I get panic attacks around 7ish every night. I want to watch a show to take my mind off it but choosing a show always just makes my anxiety get worse and worse. I get kinda frozen/stuck. Best shows that relax your mind and help ease anxiety but still a good enough story like to keep your mind occupied?
"
I have been having this lingering feeling that I am gonna die soon, this year, but I had this resistance instead of acceptance so that made me reassured that it‚Äôs just anxiety. But now I read a story that someone‚Äôs grandpa a month before his death broke down crying and saying he didn‚Äôt want to die, and that exact thing happened to me. I feel it so certain that I am gonna die, I feel that it‚Äôs coming, I am freaking out.
A glimpse of hope that someone had a similar experience and outlived it.

EDIT: thank you so much for your support! I wanted to specify that a few weeks ago I had a panic attack one night, and since than a constant numb feeling that I am gonna die has been with me. Like all day, every day I couldn‚Äôt get rid of it, but it‚Äôs not particularly anxious or fearful. And I believe today I had a second panic attack.
It‚Äôs not health anxiety, I don‚Äôt think that anything is wrong with my body that could cause my death. That‚Äôs why it smells like intuition, cause I am not worried of specific things, I just have this lingering feeling that it is coming."

"Every job I have ever had (besides self employment) I have been convinced that I am always the worst on the team, I'm going to get fired, all my coworkers think i'm incompetent, etc.

In reality, being fired sounds like a HUGE relief so i'm not sure why the thought makes me nearly throw up. I am just a nervous wreck about any job I have ever had and it SUCKS. "
"The bio speaks for itself. When I was a child I accidentally shit myself in class. They all could smell it and ever since that day I developed a complex form of social trauma/PTSD. I have never been able to hold a job or relationship because I live in this fear of crapping myself again. I have compulsions to mask the smell. If I'm forced to socialize I have extreme sweating problems and pelvic floor problems. I truly have convinced myself that the world knows me as the dude that smells like SHIT. And every time i socialize I ""shit myself"" but I cannot smell it or see it. I hate my life. I cannot hold a conversation with my peers or family. I live in constant fear. I turn 23 years old in 2 months and I am jobless. My parents pay for my rent and utilities. Some days I feel as if the only way to fix this problem is to you know what... I cry every single day. I am CURSED. It will never get better. It is a very complex disorder for me. I check if my butt smells constantly. I always carry wipes. I sit down. I am avoidant. I change underwear over 5 times a day. I think that my butt is somehow leaking gas. I will check my anus to make sure it is shut closed. I walk away from conversations. I hide from people in public. I am very rude. I avoid eye contact. I hate my life. That is it. Maybe i will forever be the dude that smells like shit."
"I seriously cannot take this anymore. I would honestly be able to deal with my anxiety fine if it weren‚Äôt for the physical symptoms that I get sometimes.

Hello my name is Mary and iam in high school. One month ago my teacher said we need to assign a group for a project and we can be with anyone we want but I didn‚Äôt end up in a group and my teacher said i should to it alone. I was okay with it because i like to work alone. But tuday we had to present and I thought I wasn‚Äôt going to present because my teacher know about my anxiety. Class started and the teacher said who wants to go first. Ofc noone wanted to and she said she will choose random. I was picking. I was like what will i do. I walked up to the front and teacher explained some rules and said they need to pay attention. Then silence begun everyone was looking at me. I tried to say something but i just said what was the presentation about then i tried to speak about it and i was like s-s-speed yk and i was holding it from the start and then i couldn‚Äôt hold it anymore and boys were doing the smiles like they wanted to laugh. I started to cry and hid behind my paper. Teacher looked at me and said that I should go sit down boys started laughing but luckily teacher started to yell at them. I sat down noone said anything if iam okay but one girl asked whats wrong and comforted me. I felt better just because of her but my anxiety was really bad my legs were shaking crazy for like 15 minutes. After that I felt better even tho only 1 girl asked me if iam okay. Iam greatfull she atleast said something. I really needed that. But unfortunately i have to present next week and iam really scared.
"You know, things that people do almost every day that wouldn't normally be an issue? But to a highly anxious person it is. 

Mines is checking the mail. 

I ordered a very cool looking cardigan that I felt I really wanted and from Amazon a sharps container for my diabetic lancets. Normally checking the mail is not a problem, it's a long walk but whatever, it's exercise. 

Thing is that I feel like if I get dressed, put on my headphones and head out the door that my heart rate will go up and I'll have a heart attack, stroke, panic attack or I'll have a hypoglycemia episode. 

Thing is that I'm on hbp and t2d medication, I've lost weight and my sugar is under control but my anxiety can't make me see that.

"The bulk of my health anxiety was from 1986 to 2000. I‚Äôve seen it all, intense fear, generalized anxiety and fatigue, perceived breathing problems, dizziness,rapid pulse, skipped heartbeats, problems swallowing, nausea, pain in the chest, pain in the left shoulder and left arm, tingling numbness in my left arm, lump in the chest, lump in the throat. Does any of this sound familiar? This started when I was 29. I‚Äôm still here at 66 and fully recovered. All that worry over nothing. . If your doctor tells you that you are safe and you don‚Äôt have anything, believe him. 

I remember a therapist who recovered from cardiophobia telling me this and somehow I wasn‚Äôt convinced. I wanted the symptoms to just stop. Doesn‚Äôt work that way. First the fear of symptoms goes, THEN the symptoms. No shortcuts.

People with health anxiety have a historically bad track record when it comes to diagnosing our own illnessness. I‚Äôve been there. Don‚Äôt go by whether or not you still get symptoms even you try taking on a more positive approach.  You will start to come along as soon as you start dwelling on it less. Whether you believe you can or you believe you can‚Äôt, you are right. Keep it positive, don‚Äôt fret. Help is on its way. That help is inside you. That help is your steadfast belief that you will overcome. See every attack as temporary and move on."
"Buongiorno everyone! üçï 

Today I would like to write a post that is also kind of a reassurance for myself, because I believe that no one will give you a better reassurance that your own mind that creates this whole storm in your heart and soul.ü§ç

I know what you have been going through is tough as well. We all have different life experiences, some of them are traumatic, some of them are stressful to the point we ended up with this little shadow following us - that is anxiety. 

I want you to remember that you‚Äôre okay. I know it‚Äôs easy to say but I promise you that you will go through this challenging time. Remember, it‚Äôs not the very first time you had a panick attack, anxiety attack, anxious thoughts, all of those weird sensations and physical symptoms in your body. You had that in the past and you will be okay. Anxiety can really mess up with your brain and turn your world upside downs. But remember - it‚Äôs just a temporal state, one of millions of your thoughts. I am aware you can‚Äôt just shut your thought down. But u have recently stumbled across this post by dr Julie Smith (check her Instagram!) 
Imagine that your thoughts are actors on the scene. They are saying different things. Some of them are positive, some of them are very negative and distressful for your mind. Imagine that you are an audience and the one with the spotlight in your hand. Imagine through that spotlight you highlight what thought will be given your power and control. Now try to do this in real life. Try to highlight this positive thought. The thought of vacation with your loved ones. The thought of eating your favourite ice cream while watching your TV show. The thought of buying that dream clothing piece or game. Whatever this is. And last but not least remember - you will be okay. It‚Äôs just a sensation. Your body isn‚Äôt a perfectly programmed computer. Sometimes you will have some headache. Sometimes you will have some heartburn. Sometimes you will feel a bit nauseous or dizzy. Sometimes you will feel. And that‚Äôs okay. I promise you, if something is serious you will just know. But having gone to all of these doctors, having been given all of these clear or normal test results. You‚Äôre okay. Worrying about your health which is all okay you may as well be scared that you will fall off the stairs. That you will be hit by a car. I‚Äôm just saying that don‚Äôt think about something that is so highly unlikely to happen. Remember that 99% of the things you are afraid of will never happen. 1% is still very unlikely. You‚Äôre okay. Take a deep breath. You‚Äôre fine. You will be fine ü§ç"

"The thought of the passing of time scares me. I am only 14 almost 15 but it makes me so anxious. In about 5 and a quarter years I will already be a quarter of the way done with life and that is if I don‚Äôt die earlier. I also don‚Äôt think that I can be happy until I move out which means I‚Äôll have to be around 29 before I can be happy. I also have to get a job and go to school which means I can be happy for less than half of my life. Also what if I just never do what I want to do in life/ become happy that sounds miserable. I also don‚Äôt want my body to deteriorate and the people I care about die. Any tips to deal with this?

"Recently I‚Äôve been having really horrible anxiety attacks. They last for hours and hours, my emergency meds don‚Äôt work and when I ‚Äúlay down to relax‚Äù at the behest of my husband, it makes it even worse. A couple years ago, I was able to calm myself down during panic attacksby going into a private space like a bathroom and running through powers of two in my head like 2,4,8,16,32,64‚Ä¶. Up into the millions until I felt better. I know it‚Äôs weird but I‚Äôm a physics PhD student so I guess I like numbers. Anyways, that hasn‚Äôt been helping recently for my anxiety attacks, which are different from panic, but I did find that the only thing that can calm me down is organizing my pokemon cards. I have binders of them and I just go through them and make sure everything is in order and near and in its place. It‚Äôs the only thing that can take my mind off of it. 

So I guess my question is: what weird thing do you do to calm yourself down during either a panic or anxiety attack?"

dying isn‚Äôt what scares me, not knowing what comes after dying terrifies me. does anyone else feel the same way?

everytime i start thinking about death, i start getting this crazy derealization feeling and i start having a panic attack.

my main fear of death stems from the fact that my brain can‚Äôt fathom what happens after you die. I know a lot of people say it‚Äôs like before you were born, but honestly that scares me even more. 

The idea of everything i‚Äôve done just being wiped away in an instant and that I won‚Äôt exist anymore is a terrifying feeling that makes me feel like everything is unreal.

"Hi all, first post to this group and looking for some advice please! I would say my default setting is sort of a constant low level of anxiety with periods every few months of severe anxiety that can last a couple of weeks. I also struggle with OCD/intrusive thoughts which I‚Äôve learned to manage with CBT and medication, but when I have quite bad ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù(not sure what the right term is) this can be quite bad and scary. 

I notice that whenever I drink, my anxiety and intrusive thoughts are terrible for a couple of weeks and sometimes a hangover can kickstart the cycle. 

Over the years I‚Äôve learned my alcohol limits and been able to avoid getting into terrible states of anxiety due to alcohol. But the past couple of weeks I‚Äôve had a couple of occasions where I haven‚Äôt stuck to my limits (my hen do, 30th birthdays etc). It‚Äôs always been in the back of my mind whether I just quit drinking all together. My boyfriend is in AA and he claims that it might be more difficult to quit drinking when you don‚Äôt have a problem with abusing it. His mindset is he simply can not drink because he can‚Äôt do it in moderation and it will ruin his life etc. whereas I don‚Äôt have that because whilst it‚Äôs bad for my mental health I know I don‚Äôt have an issue with substance/alcohol abuse.

So a question, for those who have quit drinking for anxiety, has it helped and how have you changed your mindset to think ‚ÄúI cannot have a drink because of my mental health‚Äù. It seems like it would be tough to not fall back into ‚Äúwell one won‚Äôt hurt‚Äù. Also, how has your life changed for the better, and do you find social events more difficult/what is your response when people offer you a drink? 

TLDR - would you recommend quitting alcohol to improve your mental health and how have you managed to do this successfully?"

This has happened before but only at the doctors office especially after shots or getting blood drawn. Now I‚Äôm thinking maybe I have two types of panic attacks.

I was curious anyone else‚Äôs experience since I know anxiety can manifest in other ways. Is it always caused by a trigger for you, or do sometimes you just simply panic? 

edit: thanks for your responses :) it‚Äôs so interesting to see how this manifests differently for everyone. i‚Äôm sorry to everyone dealing with physical anxiety and panic. It‚Äôs not fun! "
"I have always had crippling anxiety, but in the last year it‚Äôs been unusually bad, and I have to pee literally ALL the time. Even if I‚Äôm not drinking a whole lot, I probably use the bathroom at least 20-30 times a day, mostly at night (which make it pretty much impossible to stay in bed for more than an hour or two, even with sleep meds). It really is agonizing. Sometimes it won‚Äôt be even be a large volume of it, but my bladder feels like it‚Äôs full. And the more worked up I am the more I have to go. "

"I have health anxiety, so obviously I have visited doctors a lot and complained about things that ""aren't real."" It seems like that has made them believe everything I complain about is always related to anxiety. I once had to argue with a doctor that no, I am not bleeding because I am upset, I am upset because I am bleeding.

So, good news and bad news: I have debilitating anxiety, but turns out I'm also immortal."
"I finally did it! After sitting and battling my anxiety of phone calls for half-an-hour with the number waiting on my phone, I finally mustered up the courage to book an appointment with a doctor this week! I‚Äôm honestly so glad I did it I could cry lol.

Now the next challenge is actually getting to the appointment on Friday and finding the courage to explain my concerns. "
"I feel like I can't enjoy things anymore, I'm absolutely horrified."
"I have had so many anxiety symptoms but for the past year by far the worst one has been the burning feel that I keep experiencing in my lower belly/pelvic region, my back, and my hips. It gets bad sometimes no matter what I eat and I don‚Äôt know how to make it go away. I guess I just wanted to see if I was alone. :( "
"My anxiety meds can be lifesavers, but you can‚Äôt drink on them, and a lot of the events that trigger my anxiety are parties, holiday gatherings, loud celebrations, etc where people really pressure you into drinking. I find that while alcohol is supposed to loosen you up, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mix well with my anxiety (and isn‚Äôt healthy to self-medicate with). 

I‚Äôve tried ordering virgin drinks before at a wedding reception so I‚Äôd have the option of taking my rescue meds and other guests snarkily asked if I‚Äôm an alcoholic (which is also odd to me because I don‚Äôt think people should be made fun of for having an addiction disorder; I feel like that‚Äôs just going to make them feel worse). And sometimes, due to various factors, I don‚Äôt have the excuse of needing to drive and thus be sober. 

It can get so frustrating, and while it‚Äôs obviously not the same, it makes me really feel for people who do have problems with drinking and have to constantly deal with the awkward conversations that come from turning people down. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong: drinking can be fun, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it if you‚Äôre able to stay healthy and not go overboard. But sometimes I wish it wasn‚Äôt the default."
"If you can pinpoint the pain and it worsens when you press on it, it‚Äôs unlikely to be heart-related. Here‚Äôs why:

1.	Heart-Related Pain (Angina):
- Pain from a heart issue, like angina or a heart attack, is typically diffuse and deep rather than located in a specific spot. It usually can‚Äôt be aggravated or relieved by pressing on it.

2.	Musculoskeletal Pain:
- If pressing on the part that hurts worsens the pain, it‚Äôs likely coming from the muscles, ribs, or cartilage, not the heart.

- Muscle strain, tension, or costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs) can cause localized pain that is sensitive to touch.

- Anxiety and poor posture can also lead to tight chest muscles, which can create pain that worsens with pressure.

3.	Nerve Pain:
- If a nerve is irritated (for example, in the ribs or chest wall), you might feel sharp, localized pain when pressing on the area. This, too, is unrelated to the heart.

Why It‚Äôs Reassuring:
If you can localize and worsen the pain by pressing on it, it‚Äôs almost certainly not heart-related. This type of pain is more often linked to muscles, cartilage, or nerves and is often influenced by posture, anxiety, or physical tension.

(Bonus info: The pressure or tightness we feel on our chest can usually also be worsened by touching the middle or the sides of the ribs, and therefore suggests that it most likely isn‚Äôt heart related.)"
Or am I just crazy üò≠ sometimes I don‚Äôt even realize i‚Äôm doing it 
"I post this every now and then because I was in a very dark hole with my health anxiety. I had some very real health problems I was dealing with, but my anxiety made them feel like life sentences. I could barely function, and was desperate for help.

I noticed that any normal ""anxiety""-based therapies did not help my health anxiety. If anything, they worsened it. Stuff like meditation, talking about it, writing about it, etc. It made my anxiety far worse. I knew that OCD ran in my family and I had small compulsions in my life, but I didn't realize that there is something called Pure-O. Turns out, that's what I have!

Basically, this type of OCD means you have compulsions and rituals (much like washing your hands) but they're all mental. For us with health anxiety, that means you might have an intrusive thought about your health and will immediately need to ""cleanse"" your mind by googling or asking someone for reassurance. Do you notice that you feel some relief, temporarily, but then the thought comes back and usually stronger after some time? That's OCD. That's the exact feeling someone has when they feel the need to constantly wash their hands. They just *need* to clean their hands physically, the same way you *need* someone to tell you that you're going to be ok, or you *need* to just find that one article that will tell you exactly what you want to hear and alleviate your fears.

Luckily, treating OCD is simple though difficult to achieve. You can look into Exposure and Response therapy and all the other OCD therapies, but really it comes down to this - don't act on your thoughts. Don't create secondary thoughts from them. Definitely don't google or ask for reassurance. Just let your thought come into your head, and immediately try to focus your attention elsewhere. Don't even try to force the thought out. Any type of ""interaction"" with the thought isn't going to help. Just let it stay there, and eventually, it'll leave. This is the basis of ERP which is the gold standard for OCD treatment. It's very difficult to do on your own, so I recommend finding a specialist if you can. However, I did a ton of work on my own that was immensely helpful, so it's possible.

It feels difficult at first, but over time you'll have a ton of practice. I still have good days and bad days, but my bad days are few and far between whereas they were 90% of my waking life before.

You're going to be ok :)"
"When anxiety hits, I often find myself wanting to escape from everything. It's like a fight-or-flight response, but the urge to flee is overwhelming. I'm curious if anyone else feels the same way. How do you deal with it? Do you have any strategies or coping mechanisms that help you stay grounded during those moments of intense anxiety?"
"You only have one life. That‚Äôs all we get is one life and is this how you want to spend it? Being in constant fear some thing is wrong? 

This is what I tell myself all the time. And it is true why am I ruining my quality of life when it‚Äôs the only one I get? 

Even if something might happen to me one day why not enjoy this life until then? Why not have as much fun as I can incase that day happens?

Obviously this is said way easier then done but it‚Äôs something I remind my self all day long and I do believe it‚Äôs helping me some working on my anxiety. 

I don‚Äôt want to sit inside all day thinking about the dark day until it comes. That‚Äôs no way to live. So if you are struggling remind yourself. Only one life is this how I want to spend it? 

We will get better. We will get our lives back. Might not be your ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life back but that‚Äôs okay a new lifestyle might be even better! Don‚Äôt give up we can beat it."
"I‚Äôve experienced many, but currently having a lot of lightheaded spells, feeling like I‚Äôm going to faint and shortness of breath."
"On vacation for the week with my fianc√© on the beach. It's the last day today, we head home tomorrow. Just got out to the beach about 2 hours ago and guess what? Full blown panic attack. Sitting on the beach, sun beating down on me, sweating bullets, and I suddenly feel my heart racing and my legs shaking. The only thing that helps me during panic is COLD. So I ran down to the ocean and put my legs in. Somehow, making it 100x worse (probably heart rate increasing even more). 

I went back to my chair and just sat there and breathed in through nose, out through mouth. I told my fiance what was happening and he told me to go back to the hotel room and relax but I didn't want to run away from it, I wanted to face it. So I sat there and I faced it head on. No ice packs, no fan blowing on my face, no calmigo (my favorite device by the way). Just me, myself and I. 

And I survived it. And you can too. Don't be afraid to leave your house incase this happens. Did it happen to me? Yes. Will it happen to you? Maybe. But I am fine now. It didn't ruin my vacation, because I didn't ALLOW it to. I had a panic attack, it sucked for 1 hour, and now I'm going to continue my day like nothing happened. "

"I‚Äôve been posting a lot, which I never do, therefore you can tell I‚Äôm in the middle of a very anxious period of my life. I have so many symptoms that I have a hard time believing these can all be anxiety, but I‚Äôm almost positive they are. Does anyone else share any of these, and are they anxiety? How do you feel better or prevent them from happening?

Anyway, I‚Äôve been having the following symptoms (in order of worst to manageable):

-dizziness (tied for first with nausea)

-nausea (tied for first with dizziness)

-feeling very hot

-feeling like I want to crawl out of my skin (I guess the ‚Äúflight‚Äù in ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù

-sweating

-diarrhea

-vision seeming very sharp and noticeable floaters

-strangely loud burps (almost out of nowhere)

-bloating 

-shaky hands during times of VERY high stress 

-fatigue (the fatigue I can manage because it‚Äôs a nice break from being sooo keyed up from anxiety). 
"
For me personally when I first wake up I feel a wave of anxiety come over me about the day 
"I see you.  I wish that none of us had to suffer like this. The struggle from moment to moment,  the fear,  the exhaustion. The confusion from others when you explain your feelings and those that are healthy don't understand. 

Please keep going.  Know that there are others that understand you and wish you well even though we've never met. 

I hope you all find peace and are able to heal. "

"Can anxiety affect you to the point where you feel like you have to go the toilet , for a bowel movement?

"Maybe you curl up in a ball of anxiety that cones out of nowhere or the anxiety you get from thinking of the million things wrong with your health I promise you are not alone. Weather you are worried is it a heart attack or panic attack.. you are not alone. Waking up and anxiety dropping on the pit if your stomach like pouring rain or the existanal crises you have every night‚Ä¶ worrying worrying about everything and everything thinking of the smallest details no one would think of.. you are not alone.. weather youre on medication for it or not.. weather you have accepted that you need to take 2 antidepressants and you are dependent on your benzodiazepines to get you through an another day, another hour or minute you are not alone. It helped me so much knowing i was not alone. Had anxiety probably all my life, worsened at 8 ptsd developing at 8 till my first panic attack at 19.. i almost identify as anxiety rather than human at this point but i am so thankful to be alive. We are so fucking strong. Fighting demons in your head is something that will humble you. But you are not alone, although you swear no one else can feel like this. We can and we do. Keep going minute by minute. You got this!"
"A pill that takes away all of your anxiety, keeps you sober, makes you feel like before you ever had anxiety, works almost instantly, lasts all day and doesn‚Äôt bother you that there‚Äôs something different about yourself. It‚Äôs a nice thought, but not a reality for most americans under 30. Medicine like that exists though. It‚Äôs in a special class of anti-anxeity drugs called benzodiazepines. They‚Äôre controlled substances and haven‚Äôt been widely prescribed since before a lot my generation reached adolescence. Say what you want about them or the long term effects but I‚Äôd rather be addicted to a drug then gamble with allergic reactions and crippling side effects of the antidepressants that keep getting thrown at me like they‚Äôre candy. 

Some background: I have OCD, not TikTok OCD, think Sheila from the TV show Shameless type of OCD. And naturally I went to a psychiatrist to get help. I was given countless drugs since then. SSRI‚Äôs, SNRI‚Äôs, Antipsychotics, antihistamines, blood-thinners, and even a fucking seizure medication. But never a benzodiazepine. I also got therapy, did CBT, TMS, and even Exposure Therapy, nothing fucking worked. Last night I had a panic attack so bad comparable to the one that cost me my job just before I started getting help and went to the ER. I tried breathing techniques, grounding myself, and even took a blood thinner to stop all of this before I embarrassed myself at the ER again. Everything failed. The doctors saw me monitored my heart rate but when my mom told him that I had OCD he did something different. He gave me Valium. I didn‚Äôt want to take it at first because drugs scare me. But after I took it about 30 minutes later, I felt like a human being. I kept flinching at things expecting anxiety, but no anxiety ever came. It took everything I feared away, left me conscious, and made me able to enjoy things like TV and warmth. Before I went to bed I almost cried knowing that this will be over tomorrow and eventually I‚Äôll be back to my old self. Because I was given Valium I have an actual chance to get a prescription for it now, not a good chance, but a chance and that brings me some peace. Because I always knew that if they gave me the ‚Äúgood stuff‚Äù I‚Äôd be free from the hell that is my life, and I was right. 12 hours of peace feels amazing, not like I‚Äôm on drugs but like a sunset. It‚Äôs so sad that because a few people in the past abused these drugs, the hundreds of thousands that could benefit from the have to suffer."

How do you guys help yourselves when you first wake up in the morning and you wake up feeling petrified? How do you deal with the racing thoughts? Some days I wake up and this fear is so intense that it makes me sick to my stomach. I‚Äôm having a really hard time seeing any hope with this mental condition and it just seems to be getting worse.
"‚Ä¶but relax. Take a deep breath, relax your shoulders, unclench those muscles and your jaw, let your tongue down from the roof of your mouth, and just relax for a second. I know life is scary right now, but truly, everything will be okay. 

Personally, those things I said help me relax a ton, and feel safe. Unconsciously, you can clench your jaw, muscles get all tight, you‚Äôre breathing shallow. Being reminded in the beginning helped me, and now every once in a while I will relax everything subconsciously. I love yall, promise you‚Äôre okay! "

"I‚Äôm 22 F, I have general and social anxiety for background info in case I find someone to talk to but my chest hurts.

I‚Äôm freaking out and having a panic attack because I read a horror story about how damaging coloring your hair is and I have colored hair. I‚Äôm freaking out because my chest hurts. I‚Äôm freaking out because I don‚Äôt feel safe. I‚Äôm freaking out because I feel like I‚Äôll die alone. Im freaking out because I‚Äôm wasting my life and this isn‚Äôt how I wanted to spend my 20s.

It was extremely hard to type all of this out in a coherent manner, I‚Äôm honestly struggling to focus and read what I typed and see if it makes sense. All my reasonings for why I‚Äôm having a panic attack are all so different and a lot aren‚Äôt even connected to each other.

I suffer from terrible panic attacks after consequential life events.

The knots in my stomach, tightness in my chest, nausea, can‚Äôt eat. I‚Äôm so sick of it. I am on 20 mg of flouoxetine but it clearly does shit for this stuff. It‚Äôs gonna be a long four years and I am gonna have to figure this out. I have two small kids this time around who need me. Does anyone know why this happens? What helps?

What are some of the ways anxiety manifests physically in your body?
"I know my anxiety is illogical.

I know my anxiety is excessive.

I KNOW.

It doesn't help when my therapist doesn't understand when I tell her the extent of my worrying and tells me I'm just being illogical.

It doesn't help when my partner laughs when I'm anxious and tries to wave it away.

If anything, these flippant reactions just make it so much WORSE. Not only am I suffering from illogical, paranoid, excessive worry, but now I also get to feel incredibly guilty and stupid for having this anxiety at all! Perfect. Thanks for helping, guys. Not."
"I‚Äôm on the verge of starting an ssri, but am still deciding. Weirdly enough I see almost everyone who used an ssri, getting back on it after trying to get off for a while after treatment. It seems like once you start one and your body gets adjusted, you‚Äôre stuck in an endless loop of needing it. I‚Äôm not even scared of side effects of starting it anymore, I‚Äôm terrified of never getting of after starting and am wondering if its not just better to try and beat my anxiety disorders on myself through meditation and therapy. Its just very hard because I‚Äôm living with debilitating everyday physical symptoms like extreme dizziness and sensory overload.

I‚Äôm 22, I just don‚Äôt wanna make it worse for in the future. Does anyone have any insights? Ssri‚Äôs seem very scary to me, even tho they safe lives."

"I'm switching SSRIs right now and having a rough go of it (low dose to low dose, but apparently I am very sensitive to the change). Do you have any things you do to ground yourself when you're in an anxiety loop? I'm not usually a very emotional person but I've been crying a good bit since this medication change a few days ago and it seems to help me, somehow. I've downloaded the Calm app and have been using that to help me through when moments get especially rough. I've also tried to keep around healthy snacks and always have some water with me. Excess sugar seems to be worsening the anxiety so I'm trying to avoid it. What helps you?"
"I have 24/7 brain fog due to anxiety. I am constantly operating at around 60-70% of my intellectual capabilities. Even writing this message I‚Äôm struggling, so bare with me if it doesn‚Äôt come out as smooth as I‚Äôd like.

And when I say 24/7, I mean it. My mind every since I was born really has always worked completely against me. As a kid, if I ever needed to win something important in front of people, I‚Äôd always get too nervous and not be able to perform to my best level, and would always just miss out ever so slightly. And the last 5 years my anxiety has shifted towards a 24/7 brain fog which is destroying my life completely.

Brain Fog makes me a dumb person. Even speaking to the people closest to me in the world, who completely understand my situation and don‚Äôt judge me for it at all, I‚Äôm just extremely limited in my abilities around them, and don‚Äôt have full access to my brain at all. You would think being around people who I‚Äôm close too would stop the anxiety brain fog, because there‚Äôs no pressure right? Well it doesn‚Äôt work for me. Even around my parents, close friends, anyone, I have it all the time. I‚Äôm always way dumber than I actually am, every conversation I have with everyone is always forced because conversation doesn‚Äôt come naturally to me, my mouth is often dry, I stutter over my words in conversations because my conversations are forced and not natural, I have situations where I‚Äôm standing somewhere and then I completely forget where I am and start getting confused/freaked out, memory issues (literally can‚Äôt remember the most simple things that normally I would in 1 second), and I can‚Äôt interpret situations like a normal person at all. For example, I walked past a old family friends nan the other day (someone I haven‚Äôt seen in 15 or so years) and it‚Äôs just not the sort of person I needed to say anything too as I didn‚Äôt really have an affiliation with her at all. The normal protocol in that situation was absolutely to not say anything, but because I wasn‚Äôt in control of my brain, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do so as I walked past I said hey and started an awkward conversation which just didn‚Äôt need to be had. Safe to say I felt awful about it afterwards.

Not being in control of your own brain is honestly the worst symptom I could ever wish someone. I‚Äôm genuinely not myself anymore, my real personality that is there when the ‚Äúclouds have disappeared‚Äù over my mind is constantly getting locked away by this brain fog I have. As soon as I drink 3-4 beers the brain fog just absolutely melts away, and immediately I‚Äôm able to interpret situations normally, when people speak to me, I‚Äôm sharp with my replies, my humour has come back, I‚Äôm funny, I‚Äôm intelligent, my wit is razor sharp, and my memory is incredible. That‚Äôs because I‚Äôm genuinely a smart person when I‚Äôm in control of my own mind. But with brain fog, I‚Äôm always the dumbest person in the room.

In one of my old jobs, all of the staff there genuinely thought I was extremely stupid. I would do the dumbest things, say the most stupid ideas of ways to fix situations, and just in general came across as a massive idiot. But it was all because of brain fog. If I didn‚Äôt have it, I‚Äôd have been smarter than everyone in there, but they had no idea I was suffering with it.

I can‚Äôt live like this anymore. I need to take something to try and fix this hell otherwise Im not sure how much longer I‚Äôm going to have left.. is there ANY medication that I should be trying that could help with my brain fog? I really don‚Äôt want to rely on alcohol daily to fix all my problems. I want something that can make me ‚Äúme‚Äù again.

"Met them at an AA meeting. We're younger than most of the people there; that's why they asked for my number. After the conversation ended because my break was done at work, I panicked and thought about all the ways what I said was stupid and incorrect. It took me about 45 minutes to calm back down to my normal level of thinking about all the ways I am stupid and incorrect. But, I did manage to calm down while continuing to work. Progress!"
"Why the fuck am I chronically dizzy like that? It started in 2019 when I learned I was about to be a father. I became extremely stressed out and suddenly became dizzy one evening and it sent me into a health anxiety tailspin that lasted like 6 months. Dizziness stopped after about 10 weeks once I was reassured by a clear brain MRI.

Fast forward March 2024 I got dizzy again from a sudden head movement and of course immediately freaked out thinking ""It‚Äôs gonna last months again like 2019!"" and lo and behold it did. I was constantly monitoring for the dizziness and panicked and had another brain MRI: clear again. Then had an inner ear MRI: clear. Diagnosis was basically dizziness from anxiety. Lasted 10 weeks and went away from one day to the next when I became fixated on another health issue‚Ä¶

Now September 2 there was a party at my house and I got very anxious and dizziness hit me. Once again like a fucking idiot I started panicking and thinking ""Oh no it‚Äôs gonna last months again!!!"" and it hasn‚Äôt quit since.

My dizziness isn‚Äôt room spinning it‚Äôs the inside of my head that feels like it‚Äôs spinning. It‚Äôs worse when I‚Äôm upright and walking, I feel like I‚Äôm a bobble head. I also get feelings of pressure in my head and pretty bad derealization like my vision can‚Äôt keep up with my head movements and I feel like I see everything through a window like in a dream state. I feel like I‚Äôm high or severely jet lagged.

How do I make this not last months every time? I‚Äôm getting a neck MRI in two days but I‚Äôm pretty sure after two brain MRI and an inner ear MRI, plus bloodwork multiple times, that there isn‚Äôt any disease causing this. Just anxiety doing its thing. My doctor thinks the same thing.

I‚Äôve tried SSRI and vestibular exercices but they don‚Äôt do shit. And per my neurologist it‚Äôs not PPPD as I‚Äôve never had it for 3 months+ and it goes away pretty ""fast"" (as far as chronic problems go I mean). But 8-10 weeks doesn‚Äôt feel fucking fast to me.

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I honestly want to off myself some days. I can‚Äôt deal with this dizziness, head pressure and derealization anymore. Anxiety is completely ruining my life. And even when I calm down the symptoms pop up and eventually their relentlessness gives me anxiety again and the cycle self-perpetuates.

Sorry for rambling but I‚Äôm fucking tired of feeling sick all the time with every test coming back like I‚Äôm a picture of health. Not that I want a disease but I‚Äôd just like to feel as normal as my tests say I am and not freak out over having some neurological hidden disease all the time."

"I got a call from the police department yesterday, and now I'm freaking out. Could it be something in regards to years ago?

So, yesterday morning I got a call from my towns police department and they left a message intended only for me asking them to call them back and the officer in the message gave me a name and their number and extension to call back. About 3 years ago I accidentally rear ended someone in a parking lot, waited around about almost 10 minutes, had to go so I left a note and number but never got a response back, or heard anything from the owner or police but, could that be it? I've been trying to think of all the things it could be and that's the only thing I can think of, but that feels way too long to have just gotten a response now. I know you technically don't have to call the police back, so unless they call back I probably won't and I know sometimes there are scams with people calling pretending to be police but they gave the actual departments phone number and officer his name. Like last night I could barely sleep, this morning I can't do anything other than dread on the call like when I got the message yesterday my heart kept pounding and I was shaking.



Edit: I've been reading through replies and it's really helped relieve any anxieties I've had about this, I just was so spooked and while I wasn't ignoring the ""scam"" possibility, my brain automatically jumped to a worse scenario. But thank you all so much, you've all been a great help. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Edit: Got another call from the same number today (listed as the police department) but no message this time just a dial tone and a hang up. "
"I realized that in order to be healthy I need to accept my mortality, but I cannot imagine ever accepting it.

Does anyone else get random days/ weeks of severe anxiety and depression that seemingly come out of nowhere?? It makes me feel like I'm going crazy because I swear nothing triggers it
"sometimes i feel like im in one of those scenes in a movie where i'm just like walking down the street, as if i did something wrong literally EVERYONE looks like they want to fucking kill me or think that i want to kill them. i have the worst resting bitch face in the entire world and it just sucks to go around feeling like people are looking at me so weird - once i even looked down at myself just to make sure i wasn't like...accidentally naked or something. :("

"I get really anxious on car rides so I took 5mg 30 minutes before taking a car ride and omg it was amazing. I didn‚Äôt have dizziness or upset stomach that I get when I‚Äôm really anxious.

The worst thing about my anxiety is that I get really bad stomach aches and feel the need to go to the toilet constantly and now like magic it did not happen even though I only took 5mg. 
I‚Äôm jealous of ppl who feel like this naturally.

"I‚Äôve been recently having ongoing issues with overthinking and panic attacks that always happen before I‚Äôm about to sleep. They revolve around the thought of dying or me losing a love ones and the unknown about death in general. I have tried praying before I sleep and getting closer to my religion but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping as much as it used to. These thoughts just keep me up all the time and make me dread going to bed, which just ruins my whole sleep schedule and upcoming days. Any advice would be very helpful!"

19, Male, Treating for OCD &amp; Anxiety (health anxiety and panic attacks) 

I got home and got a glass of water and took my vitamins, but i was gonna wait a little bit to take my sertraline bc i was making supper and wanted to take it closer to food.

so i then took my pills but wasn‚Äôt sure if i had already taken them. 

i‚Äôm very anxious and am scared i‚Äôm gonna die lol

i am not 100% sure if i took 400mg or just 200mg (which is my normal dose)

i am kinda dizzy feeling now but i might just be tired. it also might be anxiety induced placebo whatever tf

so i‚Äôm scared lol

EDIT: Called pharmacy and poison control. pharmacy said 400mg is a dose that some people are prescribed and since it‚Äôs only double my daily dose it‚Äôs not gonna kill me

Poison control said to watch for symptoms but at most i would‚Äôve experienced Drowsiness or insomnia, diarrhea, Nausea and vomiting. he said to watch for fever, and if i vomit more than 3 times. he said if either of those came symptoms happened then to go to the hospital but NOT to drive myself

thank u everyone for ur help and advice!

"How have you all gotten out of this cycle? Anxiety gets bad and my body starts reacting. I‚Äôm already panicky so I conclude I‚Äôm having a heart attack. I‚Äôve already been through this before, gone to the ER and had everything fine on my EKG, but I start to think that maybe those doctors missed something, that it‚Äôs better to be sure rather than risk heart damage. So here I am again.

"I have contamination anxiety. I do not have any problems eating at resturants and family BBQs in general.

Today was a family BBQ today and the host was the most unhygienic cook / host ive ever seen which lead me to offending the host as i couldnt bring myself to eat their food.

1 untensil used to cook all the food. This untensil is literally being placed on the floor where god knows how many people have walked there. Not on a clean plate, not on a small table, literally its on the dirty floor. 

No hand washing in site before handling food. Kids handling uncooked food without hands washed. 1 untensil for everything, uncooked beef, pork and chicken.

Even seen a sausage roll onto the dirty floor and put back on a plate.

Is this reasonable to not eat food, even with contamination anxiety? All 6 other people seemed perfectly fine with all this. Maybe it just is me over the top. Would be interesting to hear others thoughts. "

"So I've been going through some scary symptoms for about 6 weeks now. After my 2nd week I decided to go against my promise to never use Google again, as this has had me fall down a rabbit hole of anxiety and depression in the past. Scaring myself into a dark place that affected my daily life for many, many months. 
I'm pretty much in the darkest place I've ever been, and I'm beating myself up about it. All I've done was research and now I'm trying to avoid seeing the condition I read about but it keeps popping up on all my YouTube suggestions and news feeds everywhere. 
There is something called cyberchondria which is a term they use for people with health anxiety that look for some kind of diagnosis on the internet. See excerpt below:

""People with cyberchondria will read a list of potential explanations for their symptoms and will tend to believe only the worst-case scenarios. For example: You wake up in the middle of the night with a pain in the lower left side of your stomach. You get up and walk around, but it doesn‚Äôt go away. So you search the internet for ‚Äúleft-side stomach pain.‚Äù You find out it could be constipation, or diverticulitis, or kidney stones, or a bladder infection, or gas ‚Äî or cancer. Your mind goes right to the cancer. Oh no, what if it‚Äôs pancreatic cancer? And then you can‚Äôt sleep, so you keep surfing. Those living with anxiety or depression are more prone to worrying, which therefore suggests that cyberchondria is more likely to develop in people with a ‚Äònatural‚Äô tendency to rumination.""

The majority of us with health anxiety already know it's a damn mistake to go on Google. All of us know but yet we still do it. I'm guilty of that.
But for peace of mind, eff that ish. No more Google. 

Hope this helps anyone out there who already read the worst case scenario and are super debilitated behind it. You're not alone. 

Just stop!"

"Most of the time I can calm me down on my own, because most attacks are over before I would even arrive at the ED, but someone said docs are talking behind your back that it is not an emergency in a bad or sarcastic way, ist that true? I'm already ashamed to go there even so I now 50/50 its an panic attack or im dying. But when it goes on for more than an hour I let a friend drive me to the ED in the middle of the night. And they all are nice until they aren't anymore. Even my friend was pissed once. Man I'm sorry you have to go through this, I would trade shoes if I could to see how life is when having a phase of stong panic attacks

Out of maybe a 20-50 strong attacks (would say plus a 100 that are in control) a year i go to the ED between 1-3 times. Knowing how people think of this gives me anxiety again since this is my last straw of hope if medications dont work. I litterally can't exclude that its an emergency, i have sometimes so many symptoms that I'm convinced im dying, thats when I go to the ER because I don't know what else to do. It doesnt help to talk to therapists in that case, the only ones who can make it go away are doctors monitoring me through this when it goes over the 1h mark of possible waves of panic attacks.

I probably have PTSD from my childhood as my therapist states but he can't tell me for sure since my memory of this time is very limited.

  
Edit: I'm sorry I may have been angry towards some people because its an emotional topic for me and i posted this while not able to sleep, didnt sleep the whole night again because of having reoccuring smaller panic attacks for no reason, so i sometimes may have read comments wrong, didnt know so many people have opinions on this topic.

Anyways even if I was angry at you, I wish everyone of you all the best health and that you get your anxiety problem to a point where its okay to live with. &lt;3"

"I'm not really sure why I'm sharing this. I guess because I'm still traumatized from it tbh. 

So yesterday I went to the doctor (which takes a lot because of my anxiety). I told her I have anxiety and get panic attacks when at the doctor's office and my blood pressure is always high when they take it there. I explained that i take it at home and it is always fine. It's just a stress/anxiety reaction. Anyways, she's new and she's a NP, and she takes it anyway and it's very high. She freaks out and tells me I need to go to the ER and that she'll walk me down there. The reading was like 150/110 I think which I know is bad but again this happens only at the doctor office. I again explain it's a panic attack and her response is to tell me the symptoms of a stroke and heart attack which makes it worse obviously. 

She then leaves to talk to someone else about it I guess. I take my blood pressure while she's gone and it's lower because hello she isn't there telling me to go to the hospital, etc. She comes back in and I show her it's lower but again she says she recommends going to the hospital. I say no and she again goes over the symptoms of a stroke. I leave crying and freaking out. I get home and my blood pressure is completely normal (110/76).  

Anyway, I know she has to cover herself but I also know that this happens to a lot of people with anxiety that they don't do well with blood pressure testing at the office. 


I get that she was protecting herself but I just left feeling 1. Really upset by her not listening to me 2. really embarrassed and 3. A little traumatized honestly. 

Idk. Do you think I'm over reacting?

"If your going through the rut of anxiety right now, focus all your might on over coming it. Not simply adapting, but overcoming. 

If the fear of a certain thing is ruining your life, why not force yourself into that thing? What‚Äôs worse, doing the thing and maybe having a panic attack but surviving it ( like you know you will) or dwelling on that thing so much it‚Äôs ruining your life? 

Train your brain that you will no longer be a victim. Think to how long you have suffered from the anxiousness and say no more. No more will you allow your thoughts to win. No more will you be a victim! 

Chose life! Chose freedom from your own brain!

Say it together now‚Ä¶.

Fuck you anxiety, you will not beat me. I will no longer be a victim. 

Edit: Okay for those attacking the post, no where in the above did I say it was easy. No where in the post did I say you were not trying hard. 

This post is meant to promote strength. To promote mental fortitude in the face of fear. To many people are looking for a reason to be angry, or to knit pick. If my post makes you upset, then this form of anxiety help is not for you. We all have our own flavors. Mine is CBT without assistance of SSRI. 

I will not accept a victim mentality any longer. No reason to be upset! Conquer the day and take a step toward freedom"

"I have been suffering for more than 1.5 years. But today, I decided to end all of that and I went to a psychiatrist. 


The psychiatrist told me that I have anxiety and developed into depression (idk if I understood it well or not) and prescribed me 3 medications:

Serlift 100mg (sertraline) &gt; 1/2 tablet daily in the first week, then a whole tablet in the next two week daily.

Bioprex 2.5mg (Olanzapine)&gt; 1 tablet only if I have insomnia 

Librax (chlordiazepoxide &amp; Clidinium)&gt; 1 tab in the morning because I have IBS (I was on coloverin SR).


Now, I did some research about these meds and found out that Olanzapine is a terrible medication and many people had bad experience with it. I am scared to take it.


What's your experience with these medications?

"Well... Even though I'm still checking myself from time to time...

Today was a pretty good day from me. 

Why?

I got full sleep. I was more concentrated. I ate well. I walked for one hour relaxed. I was mostly devoid of any worries about my heart or my neurological worries.

And... My heart rate wasn't racing even when exercising, my blood pressure when I measured it was like that of a child's, my speech was perceived by myself as clear, when I had doubts about it and when everyone else already had said I shouldn't be worrying because it sounds perfect, my balance for which I had worries as well was dandy...

All these worries were from me being in a state of panicked alert the day before yesterday about either getting a cardiac arrest (knock on wood, knock on wood, knock on wood), or a serious neurodegenerative disease. 

When I stopped looking at this shit... They all disappeared. Almost entirely. As if they never were there.

So...

Even though I still check them out, for vigilance's sake (can't shake it off yet unfortunately), I can tell you with all guarantees possible: when you're not preoccupied with them, they're not there.

Don't. Check. Them. Out. Because your brain will receive that information as if there's something happening. While nothing is there. At all. Nothing is happening. Hundreds of millions of people go what we go through. If we based our symptomatology on what Google says... We'd all already be dead. But we're fine and healthy.

Don't let anxiety determine how you'll live. We're all honestly infinitely better than this humiliating situation we're subjecting ourselves into."
"I am 31 year old guy and I never had any history of anxiety issues or panic attacks and had a few 2 weeks ago in the middle of the night. Went to the ER both times thinking it was heart related- breathing heavy, heart racing etc. was diagnosed as anxiety attacks. I had only started smoking marijuana every night over the past 8 months and am wondering if that‚Äôs what caused this randomly. After thinking I guess this whole month I was feeling a little off/sick but ignored it. Over the past few weeks I have improved a little- feelings of anxious, feeling really cold and then sweaty, extremely nauseous, racing thoughts about bad things happening. I think I am a little traumatized by my panic attacks and the ER visit. Those symptoms come and go throughout my day. My pcp diagnosed me with general anxiety disorder and also referred me to a cardiologist just to really make sure that isn‚Äôt an issue since I had the ER visits. I stopped smoking the first time this happened and don‚Äôt want to ever go back. Also stopped any alcohol, coffee and eating a lot healthier and going for walks. Hot showers seem to relax me a lot when I feel any symptoms.  Is it possible my body just needs to detox from the marijuana completely? how long does that take?  It has been exactly 2 weeks since this started. I am a little nervous about starting SSRI since I have never had an issue before. Dr prescribed hydrozyine and only took a couple times.  Just want to feel better- it‚Äôs impacting my work and home life. Any thoughts or experiences like this? Seems I have a lot of symptoms of cannabis induced syndromes so not entirely sure if I should think it‚Äôs that or not."

And lots of water too."
"I know it‚Äôs kind of counterintuitive maybe, but I‚Äôm always worried that I might have cancer or have a heart attack or something else wrong with me and yet I‚Äôm even more scared of going to the doctor, I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm worried that they would just confirm my worst fears. Does anyone else feel this way?"
"Hi guys, I just wanted to share my journey here to all of you, since I love seeing success stories on here. 

I‚Äôve dealt with anxiety for a very large portion of my life. I don‚Äôt really remember life before it. However, my anxiety got much worse in late 2021 after a very traumatizing event (won‚Äôt go into detail to avoid TWs), and anxiety became the dominant force in my life. 

I had nightmares every night. I was absolutely terrified to even step one foot outside the house. This anxiety consumed me, changed me, and played a role in every single thought or decision I had. My life that I‚Äôd had before that was essentially gone at that point (or so I‚Äôd thought). 

Up until June of this year, my life mostly stayed the same. I had tried going out a few times, to some NASCAR races or other smaller events, but to no avail. Every time, anxiety and panic would win. Eventually, I became complicit with my life. I had thought that I was happy with the life I‚Äôd gotten. 

All of this changed when a long-time friend came to visit me for the first time. I was honestly terrified. I ended up developing PPPD from it, and that in itself caused more anxiety. But‚Ä¶ once he was here, I decided I was going to try just a little bit. Just a small restaurant for a bite to eat. 

And I did it. It was extremely difficult for me, but I did it. And I celebrated that small victory and everything it meant for me. I proceeded to get myself out of bed, and do it again the next day. From that point forward, I knew that I had the strength within me to keep going. 

I eventually went and visited my girlfriend. We went to the mall together, which had been a major source of my anxiety in the past. I won‚Äôt lie, it was extremely difficult. The anxiety was deafening. However, once again, I took it bit by bit. I eventually succeeded, even if only for a short period. 

A month later, I got a retail job. Surrounded by people, it was the ultimate trigger for my anxiety. I‚Äôve been harassed, stolen from, and more, but what all this has done for me is taught me that I can handle it. I‚Äôm stronger than my anxiety. 

Two weeks ago, I crossed the first of two things off my list of major goals. I went to a NHL game, and stayed the entire time. It was terrifying to me. I was uncomfortable almost the entire time, but I was able to do it. I learned to live with the anxiety and eventually appreciated it. 

And just this past weekend, I went on a plane! I went on a trip! I went to a nascar race, with massive crowds of people! And at the end of it, I was OKAY!!

Through all of this, I‚Äôve struggled a lot. I failed a lot of times at getting myself up and going. This wasn‚Äôt an easy job. These are the few things I‚Äôve found that made the most difference for me. 

- Learn to live with the anxiety. It‚Äôs not going to go away, and it‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing. Learn to appreciate it. It‚Äôs trying to keep you safe. Accept that you are going to be uncomfortable, but you are stronger than it. 

- Keep going. Every little gain, every victory, celebrate it. Just a little bit each day. You ARE stronger than your anxiety, I believe in you. At times it may seem pointless, useless, etc, but I promise you that every little gain is worth celebrating and that you too will be able to overcome it. 

- Evaluate what spikes your anxiety. For me, it was death (and the subsequent fear of it). Conquering that fear inside of me made the anxiety that much more tolerable. All anxiety has a root cause, even if it‚Äôs majorly distant - find that, and do your darndest to make even the slightest progress on it every day. 

- THERAPY. Nothing can replace therapy. It‚Äôs not a miracle tool, but it helps. 

All in all, I just wanted to hope this post could inspire someone. If it can motivate just one person to take that little step, I‚Äôd be thrilled. If it does, please tell me, because I‚Äôd love to see your progress. I love and appreciate all of you. "
"Therapist: Well, what kinds of things did you worry about when you were a child? 

Me: Oh, you know, just the normal things that every kid worries about. Big scary things like getting kidnapped or murdered or like, the house burning down with me inside of it.

Therapist: üòÄ ... so that actually isn't normal

Me: oh üòÄ 

Guess I'm just gonna go unpack that now ü•≤"

"Hey All, 

So I have pretty severe anxiety in many forms (health, social, general anxiety; a little agoraphobia, slight OCD).

Monday night I ate a huuuggee meal, way more than normal. I was super full but not uncomfortable.

An hour later, my throat felt.. tight? Not sure how to describe the feeling. I also had a dry cough, tight chest/pain (like a band around my chest), labored breathing, and a headache. 

I mostly thought these were anxiety symptoms but of course I consulted Dr. Google. Lo and behold, these were signs of heart attack or stroke that required immediate ER attention. 

Reluctant and anxiously, I went to the ER, expecting to be humiliated by another anxiety diagnosis. But my blood pressure was 153/94 (üò≥), heart rate was 110, blood oxygen was hovering around 90%. Safe to say I was full-on freaking out by now.

*BUT, maybe not for a silly reason. We did all the tests; EKG, CT Scan w contrast, blood tests, chest Xrays.

Diagnoses were ""Anxiety problem, Positive D-dimer, and AKI (Acute Kindney Injury). 

Docs were super worried about a blood clot considering my symptoms and Positive D-dimer test. And I don't even remember the doc going over the AKI.. so I have no idea the severity of that issue (plus, they had to give me Vistaril and Ativan to calm me down so by the time discharge was happening, I barely remember much of what was said).

Just posting to say sometimes were not crazy, and sometimes our symptoms that mimic anxiety could *really actually* be something more sinister. 

Don't go running off to the ER now, but if something's off, trust it. It could save your life. Okay bye üëã "
"2023 year has been the hardest year for my health anxiety and I‚Äôm so sick of it. I knew 3 people die of cancer this year so I have been fucking terrified of cancer and every little thing I feel is off, my IMMEDIATE thought is ‚Äúcancer‚Äù.

I‚Äôm 31 years old male. This year I‚Äôve had like 5 blood tests done for hepatic function, metabolic, urinalysis, colonoscopy and endoscopy, like 4 ultrasounds. All have been fine. 

I thought I had lymphoma and it turned out to be a benign lymph node. Thought i had a clot and it turned out to be a non vascular cyst. Colonoscopy and endoscopy was all fine minus a minor hemorrhoid. All my blood tests came back fine.

Thought I had prostate or bladder issues. Went to my urologist and was told I‚Äôm fine and said I had the best urine he‚Äôs seen all day and he LITERALLY told me to stop worrying and go drink a glass of wine üòëüòë. I told him my primary care ordered a prostate blood test and was like ‚Äúwhat the fuck?? Why would she order that?? That‚Äôs so stupid. At your age??‚Äù

I went to my primary care so much that I‚Äôd be like ‚Äúhi Doctor *name*!! I‚Äôm back again! üòÖ‚Äù and she told me that she ordered it to give me some peace of mind. 

Thought I might have lung cancer and did a chest x ray and everything was fine. 

Now I‚Äôm feeling something in my stomach again and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh no it‚Äôs liver cancer or something.

I‚Äôm just so so fucking tired. Feel like this year has been wasted because this anxiety has kept me in a state of depression and frozen in time.

I can‚Äôt even enjoy the food that I used to enjoy because healthy eating. I feel guilty when I sip half a glass or juice because ‚Äúsugar‚Äù and diabetes becuase HbA1C was highest it‚Äôs been this past year at 5.3. Still below even prediabetes level but I got spooked.

I‚Äôm just unhappy.

I want to stop worrying but my fear is that as SOON as I stop worrying then something bad will happen under my radar. "
"We all remember covid. I used to have nightmares, my anxiety was off the charts. Words like ‚Äòsuperspreader‚Äô and ‚Äòvariant‚Äô were common. And bloody scary - anxiety or not. It was so bad I had to stop watching the news. Surprisingly, I started to feel a bit better. 

The US election is making people very anxious. Even non Americans. I see it in other subs. I see it in this sub more and more. It is the 2024 covid. 

The news (particularly the US ‚Äònews‚Äô) is designed to frighten you. It‚Äôs well presented click bait, that wants you to come back for more. Unbiased information is not on the agenda. In summary it is exceptionally unhealthy - the visual equivalent of junk food. 

So please, turn off the news and give your poor brains a break. Think of it as a present to yourself. Not only is there nothing you can do about it, you are actively making yourselves ill even engaging beyond your democratic responsibilities. 

Here ended the lesson. "
"What medication (other than a benzo like Ativan, Xanax, Klonopin) helped you with really bad anxiety? I personally struggle with health anxiety and have all my life since a young child. I'm 36 now. I'm only on 10mg daily of Lexapro and 10mg 2x daily of Adderall as I also have ADHD. I know stimulants can worsen anxiety but I was fine for months on Adderall but all of the sudden have extremely bad anxiety that is basically 24/7 for the last few weeks and I don't even take the Adderall daily.

"I see this advice on everything from relationship advice to making career choices.  It annoys me because it's such nonsense.

I get that having GAD makes my gut extremely unreliable.  If I listened to ""my gut"" I'd never be out of urgent care, couldn't have interpersonal relationships &amp; would struggle to enjoy much of my life.  I know that others don't have that issue.

But it does highlight that ""the gut"" isn't evidence of anything at all.  Instinct should be verified with proof before action is taken.

I dread to think how many awful decisions have been made based on this advice."

"I dont mean getting panic/anxiety attacks often, I mean just ALWAYS being anxious, like youre waiting on the next Bad Thing to happen, as if your default state is being anxious about things.

Just want to know how others cope with this, because I cant remember the last time I was truly at ease, even when nothing isbgoing wrong and everything is perfect. It always just sits there with me, and it's making living unbearable"
I have both depression and anxiety and I‚Äôve been sooo anxious these days it‚Äôs driving me insane. I‚Äôd much rather be super depressed cause then I can just lay in bed all day or something and not shake and try to figure out how to stop panic attacks on the daily. Idk if I‚Äôm crazy or if anyone else thinks this.
"Hey, you, yes, I am talking right to you. I hope you will see yourself with the eyes I see you one day, because I can tell you have some awesome music taste :) You‚Äôre such a beautiful human being and worth and enough. I hope you know that you do only need yourself to be happy, I know society build up the standard that whenever you‚Äôre alone you‚Äôre not living a happy live. But in fact that is not true, if you start to realize that you actually deserve all the good things happening to you, you will treat yourself a lot nicer. I hope you let yourself rest, don‚Äôt beat yourself up over past mistakes, over regret, and over everything your mind wants to destroy you. I wish I could remove all those demons inside of your head because you deserve to feel happy. If you ever feel lonely then watch the sky, because you know, someone, at the same time is watching the sky too, maybe feeling the same way..I am glad you exist and I hope you won‚Äôt ever remove your own spot in this world, maybe you don‚Äôt feel like you belong here but, Angel, then build your home here. I don‚Äôt want you to leave this world unhappy. I want you to live every little second, I want you to feel alive, I don‚Äôt want you to see yourself just existing. You deserve it. Whatever happened, it‚Äôs not your fault, the demons in your head recognize that you have a beautiful heart, they want to take it because they have never seen such beautiful heart as yours, so why let them win over you? . You‚Äôre not selfish for isolating yourself, but you deserve to talk to someone. If you‚Äôre reading this than please never forget to breath and smile.  
Don‚Äôt live up to other standards! It‚Äôs your story and not theirs.  
Life for those who couldn‚Äôt, smile for those who forgot what a genuine smile is, love like there‚Äôs no other, hug like its your last one.  
I love you and send you hugs.  
You‚Äôre so strong, you‚Äôre still here, and I am proud of you.  
YOU ARE NOT USELESS. READ THAT AGAIN.  
YOU ARE WORTH IT. READ THAT AGAIN.  
YOU ARE LOVED. READ THAT AGAIN.  
I AM GLAD YOU EXIST. READ THAT AGAIN.  
YOU ARE NOT A PROBLEM. YOU ARE HUMAN AND YOUR FEELINGS ARE VALID. READ THAT AGAIN.  
YOU ARE NOT BEING DRAMATIC.  
You‚Äôre not a burden to anyone, don‚Äôt be afraid to talk, to use your voice.  
You‚Äôre beautiful inside out. Your body is beautiful the way it is.  
Please don‚Äôt starve yourself. Please eat, I know it‚Äôs hard but you deserve food. You deserve to eat and drink.  
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. READ THAT AGAIN.  
I WISH I COULD HUGH YOU RIGHT NOW, SO A VIRTUAL HUG WILL DO.  
It hurts me to see you‚Äôre in pain :( you deserve so much man, don‚Äôt let your emotions control you. Don‚Äôt let them get the best of you.  
I love u I love u I love u I love u I love u please don‚Äôt go.  
I am sorry that no one is hearing you, I am sorry no one is noticing that you have lost yourself. I wish I could take your pain away, it hurts me to see the pain in your eyes. I love you trough my words and I mean it. I just want you to stay, hold on a little longer okay? Please? For me.??  
I hope you have an awesome day/ morning/ evening/ night.  
If it‚Äôs night for you, go to sleep, I know it‚Äôs hard to fall asleep right now but you deserve a good sleep. If you have nightmares, please, don‚Äôt let them fight you.  
If it‚Äôs day for you, don‚Äôt start it by such sad music, I know it‚Äôs impossible to have a good day with such mindset but take baby steps, start by drinking two cups of water in the morning and so on.. You will start building little healthy habits.  
If it‚Äôs evening for you, you‚Äôre probably overwhelmed and stressed, I want you to know it‚Äôs okay to feel the way you feel. You don‚Äôt need to be scared, of course you‚Äôre overwhelmed or stressed, I mean who wouldn‚Äôt? But it‚Äôs important to know that when you feel that way you should do a little self care, such as taking a bath for example? You deserve to feel at ease and relaxed.  
And if you are somewhere in between I hope you know that you‚Äôre stronger than you think, I know you will make it :)  
Now wipe those tears away and smile for me, you really don‚Äôt know much a smile can brighten someone‚Äôs day, do you? I hope one day yours will become a genuine one where you don‚Äôt need to fake it anymore, because I can‚Äôt say this enough, you deserve a good smile and to feel alive. You‚Äôre worth more than every fucking cent in this world.  
Remember crying is not weakness, let it out as much as you can but don‚Äôt let the emotion control you by giving up. It‚Äôs okay, you‚Äôre here, you‚Äôre safe, you can let it out.  
Did anyone asked you, how you are feeling today? If not, how are you really? I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre doing good, but you will feel good at one point. Don‚Äôt give yourself up.  
I am sorry you feel misunderstood.  
But anyone who gets to be with you, doesn‚Äôt know how fucking lucky he/ she/ they is :).  
Enough with beating up yourself for today, okay?!  
\- The stranger that cares about you more than anything.  
I hope this is enough for you to stay today, tomorrow will be a new day, a new start, let go now. I hope you can stay.  
This is your sign to stay and treat yourself with love, you deserve it.  
And in case no one told you today, again, I am so proud of you.  
I hope you will remember my words :)  
Until tomorrow, my friend :)

I am pretty confident I need lexapro back in my life. It really changed my life but I was scared to take it during pregnancy. 

I have two kids under 2. So my ppd and anxiety and irrational thoughts are super high the last 3 years.

"Long story short had to call an ambulance my heart was racing so fast and thought I was gonna go into cardiac arrest. Ambulance crew arrives with me still in a tachycardia event.

Doctor was super nice explained how I didn‚Äôt have WPW and other heart stuff and he was funny too since he used to suffer with anxiety. I‚Äôm still not completely back to normal 8 hours later but this week has been brutal anxiety wise to the point I felt super poorly and sick. Glad to get closure :).

I know that everybody could see how anxious and stressed I was. I did a speedrun through the subject and tried to include some humour, but my body language and speech radiated anxiety and nervousness. 

After the short presentation one of the new workers told that I should be a supervisor in a sarcastic way. And one of my colleagues made a comment about me being nervous.

I feel like I embarrassed myself and I keep repeating the situation in my head and currently I feel like I want to quit my job. 

What the heck can I do to feel better, and is there anything to do to be less nervous when speaking in front of an audience?"

"So, this is a big win for me and I want to share it with anyone that might be going through bad anxiety. I (33F) struggle with GAD since I was 17. As a teen, didn‚Äôt get much help or even empathy, because parents just didn‚Äôt think something ‚Äúin my head‚Äù was worth treating. Anyways, here I am more than 15 years later.

I‚Äôve been in therapy since 2018 and it has helped me a lot to understand my illness but, still, A LOT of anxiety symptoms. Tried meds in 2019 and quit after 6 days for having a panic attack. Since then, had extreme fear of medication, even those not related to anxiety and depression. Couldn‚Äôt take them even if I needed them. I would get severe anxiety just thinking about it, I was so scared it would make me worst or give me an allergic reaction. 

Well, 2 months ago I decided to give meds another chance and went to see a phsyachiatrist I really liked, she prescribed me sertraline. I was TERRIFIED, but just took the first pill without thinking too much about it. The first few days were rough, anxiety got worse and I had a panic attack at 3am, but called my dr. the next day and she talked to me about it, helped me through it and it eventually got better.

I‚Äôve been on sertraline now for 1 month and it‚Äôs been a huge change for me. Still have some symptoms, but will up my dose a bit in a few weeks. Even so, I feel much less irritated all the time, I don‚Äôt overthink as much and could finally HAVE FUN in a social event. Huge change and, as my doctor said, it‚Äôs only gonna get better.

I was so scared to get worse for a few days but, i thought about how I‚Äôve already lived 16 years in anxiety, so, that gave me the courage to try again.

So, for anyone reading, if you are scared to get help, truste me, it‚Äôs worth it. Find a doctor you can trust and talk to them. Maybe we need a few tries to find something that works for us, but We can overcome this. ü§ç"

"I came back from a party 8 hours ago and I haven't been feeling well since. I drank a lot, not enough to blackout or anything, but enough to get pretty drunk. I've eaten and drank water, but I'm still a little wobbly.

I'm freaking out a lot. I haven't been able to sleep even though I'm exhausted. I've been awake for more or less 20 hours in total, from before I went to the party until now. Coupled with the hangover, I feel horrible. This is one of the worst episodes of my life. There was a really bad experience during the party, so maybe that was the trigger.

Problem is, I've been prescribed clonazepam by my psychiatrist. She's told me to take it whenever it starts to aggravate in order to relieve the symptoms. But since I drank so much, I know I can't take it now because you're not supposed to mix alcohol with benzodiazepines. What the hell do I do?"
"I spent months working on a YouTube video, I've been struggling in general so it took awhile and it's the first one I made in a year, I uploaded it and then posted it to a relevant subreddit thinking maybe some people would be interested or at least wouldn't care? It was a review of a product related to a game I play.  
Less than 5 minutes later someone commented essentially 'this is stupid and pointless so I won't watch it' and idk, I've just not been doing well in general, they down voted the post and my comments, and it shouldn't bother me but it did because I worked on it for a long time and they were rude AF without even bothering to watch it.   
I know it's dumb to be upset over that but it just hit me at a bad time and it was the only response I got to the video at all so I just deleted it and every other video on my youtube. And then I deleted my reddit account because I figured, everyone else also thinks this is a pointless video and theyre just nice enough not to say anything about it.  
It's a popular subreddit so I know lots of people see what's posted on there, but nobody came to my defense and that bothered me a lot because I have done nothing even remotely wrong and I got downvoted when I tried to defend myself. (On a side note, this particular sub prides itself in being accepting and welcoming but there is little or no pushback when someone decides not to be)  
I legit cried over it and I still feel very bad. I know it's not reasonable to be mad over that but still I am. I feel like my efforts to have fun and put myself out there only remind me how unlikeable I am."
"I know many of us are hypochondriacs always thinking we have the latest disease or disorder. I myself have been through so many tests, ER visits and xrays. I just do not feel good physically.

Long story short, has anyone here ever had a physical condition diagnosed that was some cause of their anxiety after years of Doctors telling you you were ok and it was all in your head?"
"Life will get better. You won't be plagued with nightmares in your sleep anymore one day. You won't dread waking up anymore one day. You won't be weighed down by the weight of your regrets one day. You'll be able to enjoy your hobbies without fear one day. You'll have found people who get you, the real you, one day. You'll have let love for yourself back in, one day. It's not so far away, that day. It's waiting for you to meet it. Take the step towards it too. Let no one stop you till you reach it because you deserve what's yours to take."

It would be so nice to be able to start from scratch, but the instructor and my classmates have already had that horrible image of me and it will be impossible to erase it from their memory.

EDIT: I forgot to mention something in the post. One reason I'm so nervous in class is because I've got a thing for my instructor. It's awkward when he looks my way‚ÄîI don't want him to figure out I like him. It throws me off, makes me freeze up, and feel embarrassed and guilty. But, honestly, I still enjoy being there. The two-hour class just flies by. Btw to give some context, I'm 20F, taking a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) course, and we're only like 5 or 6 students in the class.

"So I have never flown before, at least that I remember. I‚Äôm flying to Germany to visit my father and I‚Äôm super nervous about getting on a plane because I‚Äôm horrified of being stuck in a flying thing in the air with a bunch of people. Even the idea makes it feel like my chest is tightening.

I got to the airport today and I was trying my best to stay calm, but I felt like I was going to pass out by the time I got out of my car. I had to sit down because I couldn‚Äôt breath and I was getting dizzy, but eventually I got inside. I‚Äôve NEVER been in an airport so I was just following what my mom said, and we got turned around a lot. 

I‚Äôm also really really scared of elevators because once I got stuck in an elevator for like half an hour when I was going to therapy once and ever since I refuse to enter an elevator. My mom said I had to go in the elevator and I got through it, but then we had to go through like 4 other elevators after because we kept going to to wrong places and I started crying, but briefly because I refuse to let myself show emotion in public. 

Turns out my flight was tomorrow, so we had to go all the way back. I convinced my mom to let me go down the stairs for one of them, but when we got back to the parking garage I HAD to go in the elevator. I thought I‚Äôd be fine but I got in and there was this beeping sound and it freaked me out and I started freaking out. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever freaked out this much in public, I was sobbing and pulling my hair until I got out of it and even after I was crying until we left.

I just feel so stupid, I feel like I‚Äôm being ridiculous and embarrassing. I mean I‚Äôm almost 18, I should be able to use a fucking elevator, my body just freaks out when I get in one. It also didint help there was a bunch of people and it was super loud, I just can‚Äôt do it. Now I‚Äôm dreading going back tomorrow."

"This is my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù job. As in, I‚Äôve only ever done freelance work and have been self employed, so I‚Äôve never worked with an actual company before. I have pretty bad social anxiety so getting a ‚Äúreal‚Äù
job has been hard for me because I‚Äôm so scared of messing up and looking stupid. I need a consistent schedule though so I started applying for jobs around me. I got an interview for a well known bakery in my town, the lady who interviewed me was super nice. I don‚Äôt have any experience with baking other than simple stuff at home, but she  told me experience wasn‚Äôt necessary as long as I‚Äôm willing to learn, which I am! Said I‚Äôd be working in a department for a specific cake, that it‚Äôs hard work, but as long as I‚Äôm willing to learn and ask questions  I‚Äôll  be okay. 

I was honestly so excited for this job. I was expecting it to be hard work, but like I said I‚Äôm willing to learn. I‚Äôll be working in the back so minimal contact with customers, mostly just doing repetitive tasks all day. Sounds easy enough, but apparently not. I show
up, meet my boss. She tells me to just observe everyone which I did. Then she sends me with a woman who was very sweet, but she didn‚Äôt speak english well so communication was very hard. I just tried to imitate what she did, aka pipe icing onto cakes. Icing the edges of each layer so you can stick the next layer on. Sounds easy enough but I just couldn‚Äôt get it right. 

I had trouble even holding the piping bag, my boss comes obviously annoyed and says my lines were not very consistent, and they weren‚Äôt high enough. I tried many times and each time she would scrape it off and I would have to redo it. I understand her frustration of having to train someone new when you just want things to go smoothly, but I really was trying my best. I really was trying to learn but she kept rolling her eyes, making faces at me, sighing, yanking stuff out of my hands saying I was wasting everyone‚Äôs time etc. I just felt humiliated. 

Finally she just has me cut berries. Surely I‚Äôm capable of that? Wrong again. Apparently I was holding the knife wrong and ‚Äúapplying too much pressure to the berries.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt understand because I was literally just holding them but she kept getting frustrated at me. Eventually I get the hang of it though and she leaves me alone. I‚Äôm on probably about my third or fourth pan of berries (you have your uncut berry pan on one side, and your cut berry pan on the other,) and she comes over again obviously upset and goes ‚Äúthis is not how I had it earlier.‚Äù I was genuinely confused so I asked her what does she mean? She takes one of the pans slams it on the table and goes ‚ÄúTHIS IS WHAT I MEAN.‚Äù Apparently I had my uncut berry pan on the left instead of the right. 

At this point I‚Äôm on the verge of tears and I felt so stupid. I‚Äôm not complaining that there are rules. I understand things have to be done a certain way or it messes everyone else up (especially with the cakes,) but I just don‚Äôt understand that reaction for a pan being on a different side when it‚Äôs just me there and I‚Äôm getting it done. 

Then the cherry on top (berry on top?) When you fill a pan with berries you put it on the shelf in the cooler. Always leave one shelf empty in between pans. I made sure to double check because we do this with the cakes. I go in, everything is on the shelf correctly, set my pan where it needs to be. When I get done my next pan I go back in and someone had MOVED THE PANS to where there was no empty one in between??? I do not know who did this or why. Before I can do anything my boss comes in angry and starts fussing me telling me I need to pay attention and place the pans correctly and starts putting the pans how they‚Äôre supposed to be very angrily (this I definitely understood, I was pissed too I don‚Äôt understand why someone did this.) I try to tell her they were placed correctly and that someone moved them, but obviously since i‚Äôm new she didn‚Äôt believe me.

Everyone keeps telling me it‚Äôs my first day and messing up or not being perfect is expected. That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm upset about, it‚Äôs just the way I‚Äôm being talked to and treated that is upsetting me. I WANT to work there and I WANT to learn, but it‚Äôs extremely hard to learn when someone is basically berating you. I feel like it has to be a me problem and that I really am just incompetent with the way she was talking to me. 

The hiring manager kept putting so much emphasis on the need to be willing to learn which I am. But any time I would ask questions I just felt like an inconvenience. It feels like my boss doesn‚Äôt want someone willing to learn but someone who already knows how to do everything. I feel like an idiot because on paper the work is NOT hard, so why am I messing up so bad?? I seriously don‚Äôt want to quit. I know if I get the hang of everything it would be a perfect job for me, but if she was this upset with me on my first day I can‚Äôt imagine she‚Äôll have any more patience with me. Today was literally my biggest worry coming true (messing up looking stupid,) and I went into this feeling so confident but now I‚Äôm completely discouraged.

Anyway I just needed to vent. Thanks for reading this far and if anyone has any advice please let me know. "

"Hi all,

New here.

I‚Äôm a cybersecurity engineer, 34 yo male. Lately, my anxiety and depression has been so tough that it has my physical sensations at peak crappiness and feeling like I‚Äôm doing awful at my job, falling behind, etc.. 
yet, I feel so weak to even admit it. Like I should just power through. But I‚Äôm exhausted and tired of feeling this way. Shortness of breath, headaches, chest tightness, it‚Äôs all been on and off for years. I feel like I want to quit my job, but money is tight and I hate searching for work.

Anyone else in a similar situation?

Thanks for listening."
"I hate anxiety. Now I don't even google the symptoms, but one joke is enough and I'm already stressed. I've had a headache for several days. it could be a migraine. weather. pressure. maybe it's the meds fault.I also have memory problems, I lose track, I trip and drop things. But it could be meds. new dose. maybe stress.


But no, my brain sees the symptoms and is already looking for cancer. I hate it here."
"As title. I rode a rickety ride and threw up. It landed on other people. Staff was helpful but ultimately I had to walk 10m to the nearest bathroom to rinse off, then out of the park. Flies were buzzing around me and I lot of people saw.

Or come up short. 

Or don't say what you want to say. 

Or stand up for yourself.

Or stand up for others.

Or when you say something awful during an anxiety attack.

Or when you do something awful during an attack.

Or when you feel like a burden when people take care of you during an attack.

Or when you push them away, because you are afraid of being vulnerable. Or scared of hurting them.

Or when you lie to protect yourself.

And when you go through that list, you tell yourself that you are horrible. Unlovable.

Unworthy:

Of friends

Of love

Of good things

Of happiness

Of peace

Please believe me, you are wrong. In the best way. You are worthy of love, and happiness, and peace. Not because of the good things you have done. Or in spite of the bad things you have done. You are worthy just by being.

You are not damaged. Flawed. Or any of those things that parts of you tell you that you are.

You are hurting. Very badly. You are scared. It is okay to be those things. 

You are not a terrible person. You may have done some terrible things. Accept them. Learn from them. And move on.

I know that isn't easy. I'm still working on it myself. But the effort is worth it. Because you are worth it."

"Everyone,

My anxiety is through the roof right now! My resting heart rate is over 100bpm right now and I cannot get it to calm down. 

I have a really big discussion I need to have tonight and I keep putting it off because of how incredibly anxious I am.

"it's 11pm here and i went to the gas station to get a snack. i bought my snack and went to the parking lot and sat in my car. i was scrolling on my phone and eating my snack and i looked next to me and a car was there. 

the driver was a man, probably in his 30s with long bleach blonde hair.  he was staring at me and glaring. i looked away and then about 5 seconds later i looked at him again. he screamed ""get the fuck out of here"" and gestured with his hand. so i did. i backed up and sped out of the parking lot and went home.

in my driveway i sat for a long time because i was paranoid that he'd followed me home. i cried and finally went inside (with my pepper spray in my hand). i'm 23 and female but i look a bit younger, and i'm small so i felt really vulnerable. 

i didn't engage with the stranger because he was clearly unstable and i had no idea what he was capable of. what if he had a gun? 

anyway, im still shaking a bit but my girlfriend is comforting me which helps. but wtf"
I‚Äôm having my wisdom teeth removed tomorrow and I genuinely can't stop crying about it. I had to stop taking my anxiety/depression meds a few days ago because they were causing intense depersonalization but now my anxiety is in full swing and I can't stop crying about it. I‚Äôm also neurodivergent and know the level of overwhelmed and overstimulated I'm gonna feel is gonna be horrible and that also keeps making me cry. I don't know what to do and I feel like I‚Äôm making myself sick from the panic crying. I‚Äôm trying so hard not to cancel because I know they need to come out. 
"I am undoubtedly academically intelligent and school came easy for me. I also have unique talent of being able to reproduce any melody on basically any instrument extremely quickly once I hear it. But yeah, these are my two main talents. Everyone has a few main talents. But growing up, my mom used these two specific skills of mine to somehow justify that I was extremely smart and multitalented. She would keep hyping me up and telling me that whatever I do, make it to the top, because I got it in me (ALL BECAUSE I WAS GOOD AT PASSING MATH TESTS). She never even said it specifically for math, science, or music. She just called me multi-talented. I literally, for my entire childhood, internally viewed myself as so much better than ALL of my peers, even though I didn't hold any malicious intent towards anyone. This extremely raised self-opinion was simply a product of how I was raised.

And now, in college, I continue to ace math tests, but I haven't actually done any science projects or hobbies, or music composition, or anything remotely associated with my talents. Because whenever I get any ideas, I am immediately scared to start on them, fearing that I might fail and expose myself as a fraud to my mom and whoever else overhyped me when I was young.

Im feeling bad right now after feeling fine earlier and i wonder if anyone else has this problem. (Also i need people to talk to)
"I've struggled with health anxiety since I was a kid. I have always been very sensitive to sensations, symptoms in my body. And it's literally destroying my life

Now I'm in therapy and I've realized that I'm not afraid of death itself, but of suffering, pain, incurability, disability. That's why the methods of the acceptance of death don't work with me. 

**I wonder if there are others like me here. What has helped you in such a case?** 

Now my nervous system is exhausted to the point where I'm actually getting sick. I have persistent muscle twitching, digestive problems, all kinds of vague nerve symptoms, weight loss and depression. And I just can't get out of this cycle: I can't calm down to feel better... just can't. 

Though I am quite aware of the reasons for my condition. From 6 to 16 y.o., I watched my grandmother die very slowly in my apartment. I saw the stroke, the consequences, the cancer, the gangrene, the incredible suffering of someone who could not be helped. "
"Hi all. Do you ever feel like your heart is beating ‚Äúhard‚Äù? I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as fast, more like a pounding. I have health anxiety and of course am now terrified that I have a heart condition. Can anxiety make your heart beat harder 24/7? Could this just be a hyperfixation? 

I plan to ask my primary care doctor, but I assume he will just point me towards a cardiologist."
"I mean it's like a little thing trying to freak you out, putting on different costumes, faces, but it's so transparent. Fear of dying, embarrassing yourself in public, throwing up, having an incurable disease, having nobody to care for you or love you, getting lost, losing your house in fire, unbearable pain, not being able to breathe...it's all the same thing when you really step back. It's this tiny thing trying to get its foot in the door and trick you and sort of drag you out of your happy place into its crazy dramatic world.

Hey Anxiety, no thanks, I'm staying where I am. I see you! You're fooling no one!"
"I know most of the time our anxiety is irrational, we are overthinking dumb things and it seems overly dramatic to others...but telling us to calm down or chill out is not going to help. 

  
I have a new job and anytime I ever start a new job I overthink everything and panic. I understand I won't be great at everything right when I start but my anxiety won't let it go and can't handle me making mistakes, I feel like im constantly being judged when I do even if I'm not. 

  
If anything, I wish there was a way I could actually calm down, but I don't know how.

"Man!! Just need to rant about anticipatory anxiety. It is 10000000 times worse than ACTUAL anxiety. 
I literally feel like im gona have a mental breakdown before things like job interviews or travelling etc. But when I actually get there, I'm totally fine. I really don't understand it. Why does it need to be like that?? Why won't my brain learn that the thing that I fear never actually happens??? 
Rant over!!!"
"In a perfect world we‚Äôd just wish our anxiety away, and that would ‚Äúcure‚Äù us, piece of cake. But in reality, what do you think it actually takes to overcome your anxiety? 

I currently, and perhaps very naively, seem to believe that the passage of time will make it better or have it go away. That, like a flu or cold, if I get enough adequate rest, drink plenty of fluids and limit myself from doing too much, I can heal. 

I have an odd mentality regarding my anxiety, almost a tough love approach. I keep thinking if I got myself into it, surely I can get myself out of it. 

I just want to know what y‚Äôall think it will take for you to get better. I think it could be an interesting topic of conversation and may shed some light on resolutions or resources others may not have considered.

"I think when I‚Äôm really anxious, the physical reaction that happens in my body sometimes resembles that of annoyance and I get extremely irritable. 

I become super blunt and relatively nasty to the people I‚Äôm around when I‚Äôm in a really high anxiety moment, I hate being touched (although this applies practically all the time), or I go completely quiet to avoid saying anything I‚Äôll regret due to the irritability. 

But then as soon as I‚Äôve calmed down I have no recollection as to how I became so irritable because once the moment has passed I can try and view the situation that caused my anxiety to over react from a normal perspective. 

And then I‚Äôm sincerely apologising profusely to whoever I took it out on. Just seems as though my apologies are futile if it keeps happening out of my control. Blegh, anxiety. Anyways just don‚Äôt hear a lot of ppl talk about irritability. 

FYI: I‚Äôm in regular therapy and in the process of trialing different meds w my psychiatrist just wanted to see if anyone experienced this and maybe if anyone wants to share how they manage it?"
"I've been anxious all day for a few days now. I feel being at home doing nothing increases this terrible feeling in my chest. I sit down and stare at a wall essentially and the thoughts increase I guess. The more hours pass the more I feel anxious. I keep thinking about it.

I want something to distract me I suppose. Rather than the atmosphere of the game being calming it can be anything. I want something fun to focus on. Something long term would be ideal but I'm open to any suggestions even if it's a game you can finish in one sitting. My ideas were MMOs like World of Warcraft because you can play it for a long time without it ending. You can also make friends with the same interest. It'll always be there because it doesn't have a end goal. Another option was games like Stardew Valley but to be honest I don't know how to play it and never bothered to learn. When I loaded it up the days in-game went quickly without me doing much... Not a valid excuse but I fear the same is going to happen again and I can't see myself playing it for hours but I'm not sure.

As I've said you can suggest single player games that helped you. I'm a big fan of them but there are a few reasons I would prefer something long term. To use Red Dead Redemption 2 as an example. I loved that game and it brought me joy. The issue is now I've 100% the game and finished everything. I have nothing to do in the game anymore. This cycle of finishing one and trying to find another makes me sad. My wallet wouldn't appreciate it either. That said I'll still play them but I'm anxious I'll run out of these single player comfort games soon xp"
I'm so worried that world war 3 will happen and will get drafted and everyone I know will die. I have really bad autism and anxiety and I'm so overwhelmed right now I feel like crying. I'm so scared.

"I practice breathing techniques all the time so that when I have an attack, it comes easier to do. But I find it makes me panic more. I don't know why.

I do the deep breath in the chest, hold, then slowly release."
"I can't even rest for a full minute, I'm always getting the same thoughts again and again and again. It could be about college problems, work, relationships, debt, whatever.. life in general.

I can't control myself, I can't focus on anything, even when I try to sleep I usually have dreams about all this stuff. Please I know it sounds stupid but it's so tiring and I feel so overwhelmed it almost hurts"
"I dunno... food for thought (no pun) I'd rather not be eaten...

But, I feel like anxiety could be misunderstood.  I keep seeing posts about changing thought patterns, new ways of thinking, words of advice... 

To me, I was basically fucking born with it.  I have receipts.  

Yeah I became an addict and was self medicating, because AS A MAN anxiety was UNACCEPTABLE.  

Please fight back against the current alpha male Bullshit, and have an ear.  We are always in fight or flight.  We are at war every day against fear.  We are fearless when we accomplish things!  Take that to the bank!  "
So when I smoke weed my anxiety can get pretty bad I HAVNT gotten drunk since my anxiety has gotten way worse what would yall recommend? Would getting drunk worsen my anxiety like weed does or would it most likely be a better option?
"You're anxious, aren't you? You may be feeling some physical symptoms now. Just know that you will be okay.

  
Browsing Reddit trying to find and answer for your symptoms are only going to make it worse. Trust me, I was in a similar place before. I even had agoraphobia.

  
My personal recommendations are:

1. Distract yourself. Do anything to keep your mind from thinking about your bodily sensations. It will be hard at first, but once you break the cycle, everything will start to get better. Play a game, go for a walk or run, have a chat with someone. Anything that keeps your mind distracted.


2. Stop searching online for how you feel. Whenever you feel physical sensations, accept it and don't fight it. Tell yourself it is anxiety, and nothing serious will happen to you. You have experienced these sensations before, and you survived it. Use these past experiences to try teaching your body that nothing bad will happen


3. Conquer your fears. Anxiety is caused by fear. Whether it is a fear of being in crowded places, or fear of dying, you have to know the reason or triggers for your anxiety. Once you know the reason, try to slowly expose yourself to it and...


4. Do not run away from anxiety inducing situations. Stay put until your anxiety decreases. This may take 15 minutes, or it may take an hour. By not escaping the situation, you are teaching your body that this is a situation not to be fearful of.


5. Do not solely rely on medications. Medications are there to assist you in doing the above more easily, but they are not a permanent solution. "
"Mine is when someone says ""maybe"" to a suggestion I make for an activity, and when someone says something that makes me feel like they are casting what I say aside. For example: I say I'm confused about something and another person goes ""No, it's not confusing, it's..."" Or if I express my opinion on something and it's not taken seriously for whatever reason. 

An interaction happened yesterday that made me spiral that was sort of rooted in those things above.

"I have ptsd and now health anxiety:. I suffer from myofascial pain and have had digestive issues before.. on 5/1/24 I had the worst panic attack ever. Normally 20min and done this was every 10min for 3 hours‚Ä¶ my whole left arm up to my left face was numb and tingly, I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, dry mouth and burping.. and felt like I squatted 400lbs went to ER who did cardiac check and said panic attack..

I‚Äôm following up with cardiologist just to be sure‚Ä¶ anyway 3 days later I‚Äôm having a brownie with walnuts and it got stuck in my throat the feeling didn‚Äôt go away till next day when I spit some mucous out that still had some brownie and blood‚Ä¶ Browone and walnut maybe got stuck somehow?? I have extremely tight SCM and scalene..


Well since then I feel like I constantly have stuck mucous and get food stuck.. I can eat and drink but just feels like particles are stuck in my throat‚Ä¶.

I also feel constantly on edge again scared to have another panic attack..

"I get really bad anxiety when going to the doctors. I always have a high heart rate (usually between 110 and 120). I can‚Äôt seem to calm down until I‚Äôve left the doctor‚Äôs office. For as long as I remember I‚Äôve always been a like this so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs causing it. My pediatrician doctor I think knew that I was just nervous so she never worried about it. But a couple years ago I aged out and went to a new doctor. When the nurse checked my heart rate she made a comment about high it was and had me do an ekg. I told my doctor it was just anxiety but she didn‚Äôt believe me (apparently she‚Äôs never met any patients that get nervous at the doctors ?). 

She had me go to a cardiologist and get some tests done. The results were normal so at least I can confirm what I already knew lol. But my doctor acted all surprised that this was a thing some people go thru. I hate getting my heart rate and blood pressure checked. The nurses always make a comment and tell me to calm down but it never works lol I tell myself I‚Äôm fine and there‚Äôs nothing to be nervous of but my body won‚Äôt listen. 

Does anyone else have this issue? Is there anything you do to help with it? (Besides medication). My doctor recommended meditating before an appointment but I can only see that working temporarily for me. As soon as I‚Äôm done meditating and go in to the appt my anxiety is gonna spike again lol. My family hasn‚Äôt been the most helpful either, a couple family members thought there was something wrong with me just bcuz of the fact that they don‚Äôt get nervous going to the doctor :( (this was before I saw a cardiologist)

I have to make an appointment soon but keep putting it off cuz of the anxiety"
Do any of you find that your anxiety is biological and not caused by life events? I am interested to see how many are in this boat as for me it is definitely genetic and biological. 
So it seems that this is my newest coping mechanism.. my average this week was 11 hours DAILY screen time on my iPhone.. this is getting way out of hand. Any tips to combat this?
"Last night, I had an anxiety attack. Family were asleep but obviously I couldn't as it was the usual night time ones that prevents you from falling asleep.

My anxiety differs to others as it isn't a fear in death or dying, I get scared of other things instead and the overthinking gets me overwhelmed then I proceed into a state of panic.

Anyways, I misread am article talking about the health benefits of lemon for anxiety but because I was in a state of fear and couldn't concentrate, I misread where it said 'diffuser' and not the actual lemon.

I got up and cut myself a piece of lemon and let it sit in my mouth, then I felt my heart rate going dowm and my mind was only really focused on the sourness of the lemon. 

This feels like a miracle, a potion a bloody dream come true. Nothing ever works for me, not the breathing exercises as they just increase my overthinking and make it worse and not the 3-3-3 method either cuz it stresses me out.

What does lemons have that causes this.

Also, I'm never listening to music again (I found that it was the music that caused me to relapse into my anxiety attacks)

:) someone plz tell me it's not a placebo effect."
"I know that it can be scary especially when you‚Äôre actually feeling symptoms, but id like to remind all of you that very similar to the placebo effect the brain can do something called a nocebo effect where youre brain is convinced something is wrong so it actually manifests symptoms, this is why if you have health anxiety about..say..heart attacks, you might start feeling pains in your chest, or if your scared of seizures you may have muscle twitches (which are a symptom of stress and anxiety already btw)

So yeah your brain can literally convince itself that its experiencing negative side effects and this is actually decently common when your anxiety is skyrocketing 

So next time youre experiencing severe health anxiety remind yourself that its very likely all your symptoms that came out of nowhere are from the nocebo effect placed by your anxiety"

Most people in my life don‚Äôt get it and whenever I explain it to them, they just tell me to get over it. Damn why didn‚Äôt I think of that huh"
"I've seen this topic here quite a few times, but most of the discussions didn't have that much information. So I wanted to cover this topic in more detail.

Have you ever finished a meal and suddenly felt super anxious? It's a very common thing called postprandial anxiety.

&gt;Postprandial adrenergic syndrome (PPAS) is a culmination of symptoms, usually anxiety-like, that comes on after a meal.  The most mysterious part, unlike allergies is that, there are no specific foods that seem to matter.

Symptoms are typically shakiness, sense of weakness, altered or depressed mood, confusion, fatigue, increased pulse or respiratory rate, hunger.

The anxiety typically occur a few hours after a meal. The causes for the anxiety can be a wide range of things and it is very important to understand what causes the anxiety in your specific case. [Here is also a good overview](https://gocalmer.com/anxiety-after-eating/) on the topic including some good suggestions on how to identify your specific anxiety causes (e.g., journaling what you eat and how you feel).

So the most common causes are:

* **Disruptions in gut-brain axis**, because of imbalances in gut microbiota or gastrointestinal distress, can lead to anxiety symptoms after eating.
* Foods that cause rapid **spikes and drops in blood sugar levels** can trigger mood swings and anxiety. People sensitive to these fluctuations may experience heightened anxiety after consuming high-glycemic foods.
* For individuals with **food sensitivities or intolerances** (e.g., to lactose or gluten), eating certain foods can lead to physical discomfort such as bloating or nausea, which can, in turn, trigger anxiety.
* Emotional responses to eating, including **stress related to dietary restrictions** or guilt over eating certain foods, can also provoke feelings of anxiety after meals.
* Diets high in **processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats** can contribute to inflammation, which has been linked to an increased risk of anxiety and depression. This inflammatory response can affect mood and anxiety levels.
* **Lack of essential nutrients**, such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins (e.g., B vitamins), and minerals (e.g., magnesium), which play a role in mood regulation, can contribute to anxiety symptoms.

While the causes can be very different and vary from person to person, the most common cause is still the gut microbiota issues. [This study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0934-0) published in Nature journal, involving over 1,000 participants, examined how different people react to the same meals and found significant variation in blood levels of triglycerides, glucose, and insulin.

It basically says that individual factors, like gut microbiome,  affect these post-meal responses significantly more than the type of food eaten Genetics also play a role but a smaller one.

This research suggests using personalized diet plans based on individual metabolic responses to improve health outcomes, highlighting the potential for precision nutrition.

It would be interesting to hear what triggers others have and also what management methods are being used. Thank you!"
"What were your first signs of anxiety and do you have any advice for those of us who are currently struggling with this mental illness? 

A little background, I‚Äôve been dealing with anxiety for exactly a year now. And it‚Äôs gotten unbearable over the past 4 months (unmedicated). I strongly believe the blood pressure medicine Losartan caused this. 

Anyways, I just remember waking up one day with obsessive thinking, constant worry and an almost irrational fear of rain and elevators. And it all went downhill from there.

Edit: Oh my! I was not expecting so many responses. I am reading each and every comment. Thank you all for the suggestions and letting me (and many others) know that we are not alone in this. This is such a wonderful community. And I am extremely grateful. "
"Its stupid but I've been watching a lot of shows and movies talking about finding the meaning in life and ""embracing the little things"". Got me thinking about just how much anxiety influences everything I do, or more accurately don't do. I'll stare at a woman's nails for what feels like a ridiculously long time but I can't tell her they look nice. The rare times I go into a store, I try my best not to be in a tight aisle with someone else there.

Forget sky diving or running a marathon or learning 6 languages. I want to be able to walk down a street and say good morning to a stranger, full eye contact and everything. I want to sit at the edge of a pond and not immediately think of 60 different scenarios in which someone could hurt themselves. It's something I'm working on, very slowly, but I'd like to think it'll improve the quality of my life eventually.

Anyway would love to hear what other people with anxiety want to do, could be a good source of inspiration."
"Does anyone else's partner just seem to have no empathy for your anxiety? Since he suffers from no issues and a seemingly charmed live, he just thinks I need to ""get over it""."
"So my husband walked out on my kids (6&amp;4) &amp; i on Monday. We have been having some issues but this was a complete shock. He said he will pay the bills until i can get a job (im a Sahm) but hes walking away from everything. 

Im anxious on a good day but this has really messed me up. Im having panic attacks the moment i wake up, i cant eat, cant focus, not sleeping well, my heart rate and bp are thru the roof and i feel like i wanna crawl out of my skin. My dr gave me a couple xanax which cuts down the panic attack but i still feel awful and the xanax is only temporary because i dont wanna depend on it.

Im at a loss of what to do. I have 2 little kids and need to find a job. I unfortunately i dont have time to feel like this. Im already in therapy and take buspar for my anxiety. Any other advice? I just feel like im breaking down. "
"Hi everyone I‚Äôve had health anxiety ever since a I was a teen. It has gotten worse over the years because I was diagnosed with a rare condition that could potentially affect me later on in life. Then I had a few traumatising (to me) events that kickstarted my obsession with getting checked out for everything. 

Few days ago I came across a rare disease called Huntingtons which is inherited, the only way to find out if you have it is obviously get a genetic testing done that takes 2/4 weeks to come back. No one in my family has it that we know of, however because it came up to me on my FYP I have a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù now that it‚Äôs a sign and that I have it. 

With my health anxiety, everything that I come across I want to get it checked out. However I want to stop this vicious cycle of constant worry and what ifs. I have therapy booked in, but until then how can I stop myself from thinking and convincing myself that I have this rare disease? I don‚Äôt want to get tested because I feel like this enables my health anxiety further

"I have essentially lived in fight or flight the majority of my life, I'm almost 36. I've taken meds off and in but never consistently through the years, so I've never noticed a major difference (with the exception of my klonopin addiction but we won't go in to that lol). 

In the last few months I've started therapy, it's the fist time I've actually kept a therapist for longer than 5 sessions, and I started taking Buspar.

Basically I feel calm for the first time in forever and now I'm like ""how the eff do I function"" lol like I've lived in fight or flight for so long, now I'm starting to actually see the results of therapy and consistent meds... And idk what to do now. What is my next step, what do I do now that I'm not constantly anxious and thinking about all the things?

"I'm 32, I live with my mother. 

I've been anxious since I was a kid. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was like 9. 

I barely get any sun, I don't have a steady job (I used to work for my father, but he's toxic and we cannot seem to make it work due to him having narcissist tendencies and being a terrible manager). 

I live in a very deteriorated house. My mom has been dealing with depression and health issues as well. 

My routine is basically being on my phone, watching YouTube, watching movies and tv shows, listening to music, reading and practicing musical instruments. My sleep schedule is all fucked up, I dream way too much and I wouldn't say I have a quality sleep. This night I woke up literally shaking and kinda fighting in my bed. 

I also struggle with porn addiction. I haven't watch porn since March 27. I'm fat and I lack energy. My life is kind of a mess tbh. 

I still have things to be thankful for, such as my parents, having close friends, my health, art, having a roof to sleep under etc... I'm just venting and I'd like to know if anyone else is in a similar situation.

I have this musical  project with a friend and we're playing a gig this Friday. It'll be cool. 

Do you spend too much time in your house and you seem like you cannot escape it? 

Btw, I take 100mg of Fluvoxamine everyday and when I'm having a very anxious day I take a Clonazepam. I just took 1 mg to calm down. 

I can't go back to therapy now, but I will as soon as I can. 

Thanks for reading. I'm obviously really anxious and depressed, so I'm sorry if some of my writing doesn't sound so coherent. I wish you all the best to y'all!

I‚Äôm so scared of the thoughts of having cancer I know I‚Äôm not the healthiest person in the world but the fact 1 in 2 people get cancer in their lifetime at some point makes me feel petrified I‚Äôm in constant fear that I‚Äôm going to die
"There's a lot of intense posts on here, which are awesome and I am so glad there is a place to vent their concerns and see that they're not alone - but let's talk about the hilarious things we do because of our anxieties. Something that is so ridiculous that in retrospect you just have to laugh. I have two:

It was my first job after the military and it was an office setting. Everyone was so kind but when lunch rolled around I realized I had packed my lunch (a can of soup) without utensils. Instead of asking someone  for a spoon or bowl or anything I drank my soup in the bathroom out of the can like some goblin because my social anxiety was so great.

My second is, without fail, I'll join a guild in an MMO, really enjoy the people but then become so anxious I just ghost and leave lmfao

What's your stories? I'll be at work but I can't wait to read them when I get off

Edit: Wow! I love reading your stories and I am so glad there is a space where we can come together and connect on these things. Anxiety can be super fucking lonely, and being able to read your stories, giggle a little too because I relate so much, has been a bright spot in a really hard panic week. Thank you!"
"So, basically I am a 16F and about 3-4 years ago I was diagnosed with asthma, and for the past wee I have been having analmost constant sharp pain on lungs and finding it difficult to breath, I tried using my inhalers but It only helped for an hour or so, so today I decided to go to the hospital with my mom, I told the doctor I believed I was having an asthma crisis, so she gave me intravenous medicine, I stayed in there for over an hour but the medicine didn't help, so I go back to that doctor and she says that I might be experiencing an anxiety crisis so she sent me to the psychiatrist, at the first she seemed very professional and nice, until she asked me if there was anything in my life that could be causing me to be anxious (keep in mind that it was a public hospital that is ""free"" meaning that you pay taxes for it but the services are free, but since it sucks, anyone that can afford a private hospital will do that, even though they are extremely expensive.) 

So I told her that my family and I were trying to get a visa And the moment I said that her face changed and she kept asking me what I meant by that, she was sooo confused at how that could be causing me to be anxious, I tried to explain to her that we were trying to immigrate to X country and that the whole process was very exhaustive specially because I had a very active part in it and dedicated myself a lot to it, and that a couple of days ago when went to do the interview and they denied our visa, my mom then tried to explain that living in X country has been a dream of mine for years so when our visa was denied I was devastated, but the woman acted like we were richies with no real problems that had no business being in a public hospital when there were people with ""real problems"", which is honestly so upsetting, and so ignorant of her to assume that we were immigrating because we were rich, specially because (just like us) the vast majority of immigrants choose to immigrate to have a good life and because their current life and country sucks and has terrible qualify of life. Also, when my mom said that it was mostly a dream of mine the psychiatrist was shocked and said ""oh so just because you want to live in X you (my mom) will do anything she wants? You (me) tell her what to do now?""

I wanted to add other details on why I was feeling so anxious (things like loliness, frustrations,fears that I have, etc.) but after the reaction the doctor had I didn't feel comfortable saying anything anymore.

She said that ""things like this happen""  and that ""she herself has has many anxiety crisis."" And that she wouldn't give me anything to calm me down because by looking at me she could tell that I wasn't having any problems breathing and that I wasn't in pain, which again is dumb, she shouldn't assume how I was feeling, she should have asked me so, specially because I have asthma so over the years I learned how to deal with and mask it, I mean, when I first got diagnosed I had to stay in the hospital for 3 days because at first, only 40% of the air I breathed was going to my lungs (or smt like that) And if you just looked at me, you would never guess that. I tried to explain that my lungs were hurting and that they have been like this for over a week but she was like ""oh it's not that serious, you're breathing just fine, it's just an episodic thing."" And that I should just ""go home and relax""But as she said that, my lungs were hurting and I was in fact having trouble breathing, and I was so nervous, anxious and upset that at the moment I was holding my tears a lot but as soon as I got out of the hospital I burst into tears, because I have been feeling terrible for so long and when the doctor sent me to the psychiatrist I told I would get at least a tine bit of help but instead the psychiatrist just acted if my problems weren't serious enough. So all of the frustrations with all of the areas of my lifes, the Visa thing and the psychiatrist treatment just made me start crying now stop and made my pain and breathing difficulty worse than it was when I got to the hospital. Tbh my mom's emotional support was more useful than the psychiatrist, but unfortunately her hugs and soup didn't make my lungs stop hurting.  :/"

"Once in a while I see someone post in here that anxiety is normal, it's a natural everyday process that is essential to human survival. There are many, many different levels of anxiety, from mild nervousness to a full-blown panic attack. Anxiety to the level of it interfering with your basic functioning, as in going outside, working, relaxing with friends, that level is not 'normal'. I have no idea why someone would say that level is normal. It's simply not. People don't come on subs like this because they feel normal. They know they are not feeling normal, that's exactly why they come on here for advice. Untreated anxiety can lead to high blood pressure, insomnia, and many other issues that can eventually be life-threatening for real, not just imagined. Just want to remind everyone of that. This is a real illness, it's not being made up because we are all dramatic or neurotic. It's real. It needs to be treated, one way or another. "

"I've been through a lot emotionally, and traditional therapy didn't quite click for me. I wasn't ready to openly express my emotions to a real person who could judge me. But then, a friend mentioned Flint.

I have to admit, it's made a huge difference. There are moments when I feel overwhelmed, and using Flint to express myself usually makes me feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I feel like I can tell it anything, and it will just help me straight away.

Honestly, if therapy is too expensive or invasive for you, like it was for me, maybe give Flint a try. It's a genuine tool that's helped me find some peace."
"So I have new meds that ONLY come in capsule form. There is NO alternative medicine because I am allergic to the alternative kind. It is quite important for me to start taking them asap. I am alsp not allowed to open the capsules up either.

I have a very big fear of choking on a capsule. Choking in general.. this is important

The capsules float in my mouth and I just can't get over it.

I tried:
- the ""leaning forward"" technique
- first chewing food and then putting the capsule in my mouth (then try swallowing it with water)
- with yoghurt

It just does not work so far. And I wastes 5 capsules ""practicing"".

Does anyone have tips? I know it is a mental thing. I can swallow pills, not big ones ( I break up big pills) but still. Pills don't float.

Please help me out with the mental ""block"" to swallow capsules?"
"I was that person. Unbothered, and sane. I had a very first panic/anxiety attack a couple weeks ago.

"It happens to me quite often and it's like my mind is trying its absolute best to try and make me hate myself which is successful a lot of the time. 

These episodes happen randomly but can last for a long time. It can be about one specific memory or several memories. It's not small mistake memories like saying ""thanks you too"" to a restaurant waiter telling you to enjoy your meal they just brought you lol. They're memories I see as MAJOR mistakes that were super embarrassing and cringy at the time and that still haunt me even if they happened years ago. When these episodes happen I literally physically cringe and tell myself to fuck off multiple times out loud if I'm alone. These memories make me really anxious but I feel like there's no way to stop them from happening.

"I have a bottle of magnesium(The Jamieson brand? 250mg I think)

"A little into this school year, my school introduced a new set of rules around using the bathroom during class, the old rule was just to sign your school journal, but the new rule expanding of the old one means you as have to leave your phone in the classroom, understandable, but you also have to bring a lanyard.

Each teacher has a red lanyard with their name attached. I hate this because it means I'm supposed to touch the same disgusting thing 100s of other kids have held and brought into the toliet, I doubt all of them even wash their hands, I've seen students put them in their pockets and in other gross places. No one else seems to care or find this gross, and when I talk about it they tell me or look at me like I've lost my head.

I try avoid using the toliet mid class for this very reason, using it during breaks, before or after class, but thanks to my adhd I'm not always able to, weather I'm distracted or simply don't realise I need the toliet until I'm about to pee myself. 
Today I unfortunately did the latter, and luckily when I asked the teacher another student was using it and said I could go with out it.

On the 3 to 4 occasions I have had to use it I was incredibly uncomfortable and freaking out, holding as little as possible with a tissue/paper towel barrier, and after touching it needing to apply ALOT of hand sanitiser and/or washing my hands thoroughly as possible, it only kinda help but I still felt disgusting, holding it is so bad and gross and will make me sick and yet everyone else is just ok with it. Just thinking about it I'm feeling gross. Is this a real issue or I overreacting or being anxious? If its anxiety what do I do to lesson it, I'm likely going to be made to touch it again and I don't know what to do when that happens."
"I‚Äôve been suffering for the past 3 weeks and made a post about possibly going to the ER. Well‚Ä¶ I did.

I was NOT okay and it hasn‚Äôt been okay for these past 3 weeks in general. I feel like I‚Äôve been on my death bed every single day. 
Until they injected Ativan into my IV drip. 

Immediately, I felt like mush. Like all my thoughts were shut off, my worries went away, and i didn‚Äôt have a thing to think about. Today has been the first day that I have ever felt normal, and what I went in with, stayed at that ER visit.

"Today was a quizz game in our neighbour town. My boyfriend wanted to go and asked me to come with him. First I agreed but today I started to overthink the thing and got major anxiety. Finally I told him I don‚Äôt want to go and started crying. We sat down for an hour talking about what scares me and how he could help. We agreed to give it a try, if it begins to get too much we leave immediately even if it is after 10 minutes. So we went, my stomach hurt so much I thought I am going to throw up on the way to the event and my heart was pounding like crazy. We arrived 30 minutes early so I had some time to find a quiet place just in case I needed a break. I also had time to find 3 emergency exits (It is a kind of weird thing I do, it reassures me to know where to go if something happens and I must flee)
My biggest worry were people I don‚Äôt know, noise, movement, no way to get home (as I don‚Äôt drive). But the event was quite little and there were only 100 people but I didn‚Äôt know this before.
Well guess what I actually enjoyed most of the evening, I needed my quiet place only twice and we stayed for 6 hours. Actually it was fun even if at some moments it was though. 

I am really proud of myself right now, I am so thankful that my boyfriend took the time trying to understand what is going on and how to make things easier for me. And he did it in a such lovely way. This morning I couldn‚Äôt imagine leaving my safe place and going to the event but I did it and I was wonderful üòå"

Yesterday it happened, my whole body was shaking so bad and I couldn‚Äôt control it, it went away after like 40 minutes, just like the other times. Can this be because of anxiety? How do you stop it?"
"In one, two, maybe six months, you'll wake up knowing that everything is okay. The air will no longer feel heavy and getting up will not seem as difficult. You will think about what you are going to do today and you will be exited. You will even make plans for the future without being afraid. You will go out without even wondering if anything could happen to you. You will be proud of yourself for getting through all these days when you thought you couldn‚Äôt and you will fall in love with being alive again. You've been here before and you ended up getting better. It always ends up getting better."
"Small backstory - I‚Äôm 41 and haven‚Äôt been to the doctor in 14 years. My anxiety and panic is almost completely about my health. Think hypochondriac but terrified to go to the doctor. 

I also haven‚Äôt taken medicine in 14 years - not even Tylenol, supplements, nothing. 

Yesterday I went for the first time. I asked her to take my BP twice. Once when I first got there and once when I was leaving. My BP going in was 168/90 and leaving it was 120 something /84. It just goes to show that my anxiety is almost always anticipatory but this woman was amazing. She‚Äôs a DPC if you know what that is. So no long waits, 24/7 access (if needed) and there‚Äôs a monthly fee to be a patient. But it‚Äôs so worth it. 

For anyone who struggles the way I do with health anxiety, PLEASE look into a DPC in your area. They‚Äôre everywhere. For the first time in a VERY long time, I felt seen and heard. I wasn‚Äôt made to feel like I was weird for my fears. I was asked questions and she truly listened. 

Now, the next hurdle is getting labs done, a mammogram and going to an ENT. But yesterday made me feel like I could conquer those things, as has this forum. 

I posted here a little while ago saying I‚Äôd update when I went and here I am. This was so hard, but so worth finding someone who won‚Äôt just throw pills at me for every little thing and instead wants to make sure I‚Äôm comfortable with my plan of treatment. 

For reference: I do go to a therapist for my anxiety. I‚Äôve just not been to a primary care or even emergency doctor in 14 years. "

"I‚Äôm terrified. I‚Äôm 41 and haven‚Äôt been to the doctor in 14 years. I also haven‚Äôt taken any kind of medication in that time, not even over the counter. I‚Äôm a rare bird, I‚Äôm aware. 

I made my appointment and after three months, it‚Äôs now less than 24 hours away. But I‚Äôm terrified and wanna call and reschedule already. 

I‚Äôm scared about bloodwork. I‚Äôve not had blood taken in probably 20 years or so now. And then having to wait for the results - that‚Äôs going to make me go insane and I already know I won‚Äôt sleep until I get the results. 

I‚Äôm scared they‚Äôll get the results and say I have to come in instead of just telling me. I do have their app on my phone where it gets uploaded I assume once the results come back?

This is a new patient appointment. Can someone tell me what I can expect? "
"Like, I cannot leave my house some days. I have 2 chronic conditions from stress alone and have not been able to enjoy my hobby in months because my brain convinced me I suck and people are laughing at me for it. How THE FUCK is it a superpower?"
"I worked up the courage to take my first pill of my anxiety medication, and I didn‚Äôt have an allergic reaction of any kind ü§óü•≥ 
One of my main paranoias is anaphylaxis or another serious form of allergic reaction. I try to avoid medication at all costs and I don‚Äôt try new foods often because of this. However my anxiety has been so unmanageable for the last month that I couldn‚Äôt put off getting meds any longer. I‚Äôm so proud that I took the leap and was able to take that pill today and prove to myself that I‚Äôm going to be fine.

"I only find comfort for my anxiety by re-watching the same few shows. Even if they're for background noise. I have gotten to the point where Im ""re-watching"" Modern Family for the 4th time. I have 4 comfort shows I keep in rotation, but watching anything other than those doesn't help. I get anxious when I watch other shows now. It's become so strange because I used to love watching new things (I love TV and Film).

I don't know when my anxiety got so bad, but I started taking sertraline this last week, and I'm hoping it begins to help. I work remotely and my anxiety has become physically painful and crippling. I haven't left my house in a week, and now I'm too anxious to go anywhere. I don't have any close friends anymore due to a breakup and I'm planning to move in the next month or so but I have no idea what to do, and the idea of moving is freaking me out too."
"I (24m) have been dealing with health anxiety for years at this point and it is not getting any  better.

I don't know where to start but I am living with this fear that at any moment something might come up and my life would take a totally different path. The bad thing is that I am afraid of going to doctors and every day I discover something new that triggers me.

My fear of going to doctors was always there, but it got worse last year when I was doing a regular check up and I was nearly misdiagnosed with diabetes (Faulty measure I guess), I later took the tests and everything was fine. Needless to say, that made my anxiety worse and going to doctors was no longer an option in my mind.

The thing is, this is ruining my life. Sometimes I have plans of going out or studying but something might trigger me and I would find myself sweating, my heart beating too fast and I would go into a rollercoaster of googling symptoms and trying to convince myself that I don't have something.

Triggers can be really anything, Instagram videos with young people having bad diseases, or if a character in a tv show or a movie gets diagnosed with something, that surely will send me into panic mode and my plans for the day or even the couple of coming days are just gone. Sometimes I notice something on my body when showering and that would also trigger that mode to the point that now I try to avoid touching my body during showers.

Today I was supposed to go out and then study, but here I am at 3am writing this post and I have done nothing other than googling symptoms (I know I shouldn't do that and I have been trying to not do it but sometimes I can't control it).

I would also like to say that my panic modes got a lot worse after I started living alone and I don't really want to share this even with close people because I don't want to be a burden or something like that to them.

I really need advice, anything that might help. This constant sense of fear or that something is not right is making life meaningless and tasteless for me. I really can't enjoy anything anymore.  
Even when I achieve something, my mind would trick me into thinking that we should expect something bad because it can't be all good.

I really need help, I apologize if my thought are all over the place but I have no other options and I need to share this with someone who would understand me.

English is not my first language so I apologize for any mistakes."

Today we were talking in the car and i was crying saying that i didnt know how tog rt better and what do i even do. Currently ive been having panic attacks and throwing up, not eating and not drinking (im scared ill throw it up), when i told him that he mentioned how hes been sick for a couple days now and yesterday he ate a slice of pizza in the morning snd for the rest of the day he felt like absolute dog shit, and i told him, ""but you just ate a slice of pizza? you barley ate and still felt like crap how did u be fine"" and he said.. ""i knew id be fine because i know whats happening in my stomach, when you dont eat your stomach shrinks and when you eat those heavy foods, it messes with your small stomach. Eat chicken noodle soup and youll feel better"" and i felt a lot better. It helped a lot to get a POV of someone who went through some thing id freak out about but its just normal and okay to them!

"I've been trying multuple, different antidepressants (Mirtazapine, Lexapro, and Prozac) for anxiety and they're making me less and less resilient in stressful situations. It's really disheartening to see each medication worsening my anxiety symptoms more and more. I had a panic attack yesterday night that I'm still recovering from. This was one of the worse ones. 

I was under the impression that antidepressants were safe drugs because doctors prescribe them so easily. I have requested benzos before and was denied. Medical providers give antidepressants out like candy but treat benzos like poison. The affects of antidepressants have been horrible.  I honestly do not know if I can survive another round of them. I feel like at this point, I'm in desperate need of a medication to alleviate my panic attacks. I feel like benzos can't be more horrible than antidepressants that are giving me more severe panic attacks."
"An anxious mind gets overwhelmed very easily.

"So this morning I, like I‚Äôm sure many other people in multiple countries are right now, was doomscrolling the WW3 news stories after the drone strike from Iran. Obviously, I‚Äôm scared about the prospect. I‚Äôm American and already contemplating leaving for another country but trying to figure out how I could even do that ‚Äúbefore it‚Äôs too late‚Äù. 

With these anxious thoughts about an uncertain future in mind, I‚Äôm walking to church, and it is BEAUTIFUL OUTSIDE. Probably the nicest spring day we have had so far. Not a cloud in the sky and a nice 65-75 degrees. 

This beauty was a great reminder to me to live in the present. It feels like as soon as I turned 30 two months ago, I‚Äôve been finding new perspectives because I‚Äôve realized just how fast life happens. One moment I was in grade school and now I‚Äôm fucking 30, living alone with a 9-5.

With this new perspective, and being outside with the stunning colors of flowers and the big blue sky around me, I‚Äôve realized how easy it can be to waste this precious gift we call life on anxiety, doom scrolling and self fulfilling prophecies. I have always seen the worst in the world, but there is SO MUCH FUCKING BEAUTY, AND GOODNESS, AND KINDNESS right in front of us, if we can just get out of that headspace.

Idk, I guess what I‚Äôm getting at is that life is fleeting, and there is so much wonder and goodness to explore all around us, and that can be the best anxiety medicine sometimes. Don‚Äôt fear the future, enjoy the present. It may not be there tomorrow, so enjoy the beauty of the world around you everyday, any time you can ‚ù§Ô∏è if I can get through it, so can you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"For the past 8 months I‚Äôve been suffering with really bad sexual performance anxiety, always at the point of penetration. I‚Äôd been seeing somebody casually and the sex was terrific, but then one time half way through I couldn‚Äôt maintain an erection. Rather than just accept this is something that happens, I obsessed over it and it seems to have led to lasting damage.

Now, after foreplay has finished and it gets to penetration, my heart begins to pound out of my chest and I can feel my erection going away. Once this happens, I lose all arousal too so getting back to even foreplay is a struggle. I‚Äôve tried ED pills and while they‚Äôre fun, they haven‚Äôt helped due to the psychological element.

I contacted a therapist who was really nice, but couldn‚Äôt help. She just told me to stop being so hard on myself. I know that much! But sometimes it‚Äôs not even on my mind and yet I can feel it in my chest.

I tried focusing on other elements of sex but it hasn‚Äôt really helped. 

I was wondering if anybody had any tips that could help me. It‚Äôs really getting me down and I have nobody to confide in.

I must add that this doesn‚Äôt happen every single time. Usually if I‚Äôve had a couple of drinks (if we meet at a weekend usually) feel a lot calmer and then the following days I am a lot more confident, but it‚Äôs then when there‚Äôs a break.

"Speaking as someone who has been in therapy for this for several years now.

Focusing intently on: 

* Stinging/aching eyes (especially after watching the eclipse yesterday ;D ); 
* Nausea/gut sensations;
* A headache; 
* Vague changes in vision; 
* Tingling; 
* Soreness; 
* Stiffness; 
* Tactile sensations; 
* ETC; 

WILL intensify these sensations. 

If you are truly worried and something seems very out of the ordinary, schedule time with a doctor. If anything comes on intensely and suddenly, consider going to the ER or calling 911. 

Otherwise, be very honest with yourself why you aren't making that call and make an effort to focus on something fun, productive or both for a while. If your symptoms are very distracting, like bad nausea or headache, for example, try a reasonable remedy like drinking water or peppermint tea. 

If you find that you are ""preferring"" to focus on these sensations because anxiety is a bitch, try this: 

1. Tell yourself you will worry about a bodily sensation for 10 minutes. 
2. Make mental or handwritten notes about why you are worried about that sensation. 
3. Alongside those notes, also note some reasonable explanations as to why you may be feeling these sensations (example: my eyes could feel a bit sore today because I was on my phone a lot this week.)
4. When the ten minutes are over, move on from them. When you catch yourself focusing on your symptoms, gently remind yourself that your worry-time is over and that for now you need to do something else.
5. For days when you really keep feeling drawn to focus on bodily sensations, come up with an action-plan. ANy time you start wanting to focus on a sensation that makes you anxious, get up and sweep the floor instead, or put on a show, or spend time with your pet, etc etc etc. Find something positive to do instead.

You probably will have days where you struggle to successfully distract yourself from hyperfocusing on your body, but the important thing is to really try. 

I am not ""better"" but after recognizing and practicing the above techniques, I've gone from non-functional and unable to eat or leave the house, to where I am now, which is a MUCH much better place than I was in 2019.

"I'm 20 and in uni  
To make a long story short, when I get overwhelmed my anxiety manifests in the form of anger. I was having trouble explaining something during a discussion, and my prof disagreed with me (this was like an opinion thing. I wouldn't disagree with a professor over a factual thing that would be messed up lol), and people (or a person?) started laughing at me. Like even my prof wasn't defending me. That's when my anxiety kicked in and I told everyone in the room to quit laughing at me. You could tell I was pretty upset.  
After class my prof pulled me aside and said she didn't mean to make me upset for disagreeing with me. This wasn't what upset me. I love criticism. It was just the fact that people were laughing at me that made me anxious. I told her that it was fine and I'm not upset. I didn't elaborate on the latter fact though because I was totally about to cry. I've been in a bad place mentally since then. I skipped yesterday's class and I'm on spring break at the moment.  
I never want to show my face in that class again lol. If it were up to me I wouldn't, but unfortunately attendance is mandatory. So is participation, but the syllabus says we can email the prof if we're uncomfortable speaking in class which I certainly am now. Everyone in there probably thinks I'm crazy now (for lack of a better word), but I feel like emailing her and never speaking again would be just as embarrassing. I feel like I just can't win here.  
If anyone has any advice I'd really appreciate it."

"That menthol stuff our grandparents use actually does help with soothing anxiety, at least for me. I was in the middle of a panic attack a few minutes ago and decided to put some Vicks under my nose and on my chest that i had lying around, i felt very derealised and figured it might help ground me by shocking my senses a little since that stuff is *pungent*.

The strong menthol scent and tingly cooling sensation on my skin instantly smacked me right back into the present, along with my usual things like box breathing but i'm very impressed with how well it worked for me. Maybe it's also the nostalgia of the smell or the fact that it helps clear your airways too, but either way i feel much better and i'll keep it in my arsenal from now on.

Just thought i'd share, has anyone else tried this?"

"A school near me was shot up recently, and everyday I go to school wondering if my life will end today, or my friends life, or anyone‚Äôs at my school, I know anyone can die from anything but this is the scariest to me, I don‚Äôt wanna die, and I don‚Äôt wanna be the next person in a massacre that‚Äôs just the ‚Äú horrible tragedy. ‚Äú that happened, nobody will know me for me just as a victim, and people will just speak upon those who killed me, and I‚Äôll be forgotten like almost all the victims of mass shooting. 

 Im happy at school, I love school, I love writing essays at school and the algebra class, but I don‚Äôt wanna bleed upon that floor wondering why people are this way, wondering what I could‚Äôve done with my life, wondering who I am, gone before I could be something, gone before I could get a job, and I‚Äôll be nothing I‚Äôll never contribute to nothing, I‚Äôll be nothing my friends will be nothing I love them.

What would my mother say, what would she do? She‚Äôs told me I‚Äôm her world, and she couldn‚Äôt exist without me, I don‚Äôt want her to do something to herself I just want her to be happy, me and her argue a lot and I don‚Äôt want to die with her last memory of me being mad at her, or her yelling at me.

She deserves the world, and so do my friends. What can I do to help myself because it feels like I‚Äôm being drained and my hands are tied. And I cannot do nothing it feels, I‚Äôm stuck. 

I take medication but it doesn‚Äôt make my anxiety go away, I want my anxiety to go away, sometimes I wish I felt nothing so I wouldn‚Äôt be like this. I hate feeling like this, the only thing that helps a bit more then medication is making art, but besides that I feel like I cannot do anything.

I feel as if I‚Äôm too young to be so anxious and worried, I should be carefree and happy, why am I not? I have no bills no taxes why am I so ungrateful for this life? Why am I me? Why am I anything is anything, anything will doing this do anything? Will my death mean anything no matter how I die?

How do I cope with this? How do I fix myself."
Every time I eat unhealthy and drink more for a period of time my anxiety increases quite a bit. I am thinking I need to stop eating bad and probably stop drinking all together as it does not bring me any positivity in my life. I am exercising regularly already but have not been for few weeks and my anxiety is increasing. Did anyone else notice that healthy lifestyle helps them with anxiety? 
"For me i feel like i‚Äòm falling when walking or standing, i feel like i don‚Äôt have any balance. Also i have blurry vision and feel like the world is moving. ü§°

It‚Äôs really driving me crazy, i feel like if I would not have these terrible symptoms i would be able to deal with my anxiety way better. But i constantly worry that i have a serious illness. :( but until this day, no doctor found anything (had mri scans of my brain, neck, had a  neurological check-up and blood drawn, and a few ekgs..)

Does anyone else here experience things like that? Does anybody know something that helps? I tried exercising which feels relieving for a couple hours but when i wake up it starts all over again.

"My anxiety disorder either started, or was most clear one day when I was smoking and felt a sharp pain around my heart (later found to be GERD). I had my first panic attack, and ever since then every little thing I feel physically causes intense anxiety. It affects every day of my life and it can be torture on severe days. Anyways, does anyone else feel this way? In the way that, for example; you get dizzy from standing up too fast, you get anxious about your health, and anxiety symptoms set in, only making it worse. That is the biggest thing for me; differentiating anxiety from reality.

I know that hypochondria is a thing and obviously other people feel it. It just feels better for me to hear others that relate."
"I have chronic anxiety and particularly struggle with health anxiety. I need to start meds as I need to start living my life but I‚Äôm so scared of the side effects etc.

"**What is D.A.R.E**

*Disclaimer: I have NOT received any compensation for writing this bro i just really love them*

D.A.R.E is an amazingly written book by a wonderful author Barry Mcdonagh. That is different than any panic or anxiety book or countless therapists I have tried. This is the only one that spoke to me.

**Here is a free PDF:** [https://www.dareresponse.com/dare-toolkit-dare-free-book-app/](https://www.dareresponse.com/dare-toolkit-dare-free-book-app/)

**What D.A.R.E stands for:**

Getting rid of the fear of fear

Reminding yourself all physical and mental sensations, are just that uncomfortable sensations. They are not dangerous.

**D: Diffuse**

-Reply to your ‚ÄúWhat If‚Äôs‚Äù with ‚ÄúSo What‚Äù

**A: Accept and Allow**

-Accept your anxious feeling or thoughts completely for what they are. Uncomfortable sensations. Waves of energy.

**R: Run Towards**

-Anxiety is waves of energy, The same waves of energy as excitement, change your perspective on these waves of feelings you‚Äôre having

**E: Engage**

-Get back to what you‚Äôre doing, and let the rest of the anxiety wave be there as you engage with life.

**My Personal Anxiety Experience Short Summary:**

1st Grade was my first panic attack, I didn‚Äôt know it then. But my whole childhood teenage hold I would randomly get these - I never understood to why or what it was. I had a relatively good childhood. I ignored it for the most part as it wasn‚Äôt a big part of my life. This is just demonstrating I personally have always had a high anxiety level then those around me. (Some people are naturally more easily prone to anger, some sadness, some blah blah‚Ä¶What you‚Äôre naturally deposed to doesn‚Äôt mean its your permanent state)

When I was 19, I began having panic attacks every single day multiple times a day, and dropped out of college for a semester and didn‚Äôt leave the house. I struggled so much and won‚Äôt go into much detail but the biggest issues for me was intrusive thoughts and panic attacks. Although I experienced a bit of every type of anxiety possible.

At 20 till now (I‚Äôm 23) Its always been an underlying issue, while not as bad as when I was 19 it has always been there lurking. So I got tired and bought the DARE Book, Downloaded the DARE app, and enrolled in DARE academy. I thought I would share a few of the things I went through and how I used DARE to help.

**My Physical Sensations and how I used DARE:**

*-You can apply the same concept for your physical and mental sensations even if they differ-*

*-I have gotten more physical and mental sensations I have just listed a few-*

**Dizziness and feeling like i‚Äôm going to faint:**

**FAINTING IS EXTREMLY EXTREMLY RARE IN ANXIETY CASES BTW**

**D: Diffuse**

\*\*-\*\*What if I pass out right now I‚Äôm so dizzy

    \- So What - Okay go ahead and pass out, I‚Äôll wake up in a few minutes

-What if people look at me weird

    \- S- What - Okay then people will look at me weird so what doesnt impact my life

**A: Accept and Allow**

\*\*-\*\*I accept and allow this feeling of dizziness, even though the feeling sucks. I‚Äôm not scared of it.

**R: Run Towards**

\*\*-\*\*Go ahead get more dizzy, I can handle it. I‚Äôm safe. I can handle any feelings no matter how horrible it feels. Its just a feeling.

**E: Engage**

I‚Äôm going back to shopping while this feeling is still there, because I want to live my life so go ahead feel dizzy.

**Heart Palpitations**

**D: Diffuse**

\*\*-\*\*What if I \*\*\*

    \-That doesn‚Äôt happen from anxiety

-What if I pass out

    \-So What Then someone will help me or I‚Äôll wake up

-What if I can‚Äôt calm down

    \-So What I don‚Äôt have to calm down right now

**A: Accept and Allow**

\*\*-\*\*I accept and allow these heart palpations, even though this feeling sucks. I‚Äôm not scared. I‚Äôm safe. No matter how it feels. I can feel absolutely terrible. It‚Äôs just a feeling.

**R: Run Towards**

\*\*-\*\*Go ahead heart you‚Äôre a strong organ why dont you beat even faster. I know my heart can handle it.

**E: Engage**

-I‚Äôm going back to what I‚Äôm doing even with this feeling, because I‚Äôm going to live my life.

**Panic Attacks:**

**Remember you can't \*\*\* from panic attacks.**

**You can't go crazy from panic attacks.**

**Your body is well equipped to handle it.**

**It is just a very uncomfortable sensation**

**D**: Diffuse

-What If I go crazy

    \-Aint nobody can go crazy from panic attacks. 

-What if I can‚Äôt handle it

    \-So What even if handling it It‚Äôll pass, let it happen

-What if I cant breath

    \-Your body takes care of your breathing no matter how much ur mind thinks about it

-What if I embarrass myself

    \-So what, i‚Äôm not gonna see these ppl again
    
    \-So what, I‚Äôll just excuse myself 
    
    \-(If its people you know) So what they‚Äôll be more worried then think I‚Äôm a messed up person and I can explain my situation after. They‚Äôll be more sympathetic than anything.

A: I accept and allow ALL physical and mental sensations I am having and am not fighting it I accept it.

R: Run towards, Wow heart can u beat any faster? I‚Äôm ready bring on more I can handle it.

E: Engage, get back to what i‚Äôm doing once the initial part of the panic attack is gone (High Anxiety can still be there) (No need to fight it)

Don‚Äôt be scared of PANIC Attacks

Theyre horrible sensations but they‚Äôre NOT UNSAFE

They‚Äôre NOT DANGEROUS

**My Mental Sensations and how I used DARE:**

**Intrusive Thoughts:**

Doesn‚Äôt matter the content of intrusive thoughts. I have had every intrusive thought on the planet. You can apply the same for all of them, but here are a few things to remember before applying DARE for your thoughts

EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET gets intrusive, messed up, weird af, thoughts. Difference is a person with anxiety analyzes it, and obsesses over it. While other ppl just dismiss the thought. So the thought itself is not wrong or what you‚Äôre trying to get rid of, you‚Äôre trying to change your reaction to the thought. \* WE have 50,000 thoughts a day .so please just realize they‚Äôre just thoughts at the end of the day.

* The fact you think something ‚Äúdoesnt make it so‚Äù
* ‚ÄúA thought is just a thought not a fact‚Äù
* Thoughts can‚Äôt hurt you
* You are not your thoughts

D: Diffuse

‚ÄúHi Intrusive thoughts that are here to annoy me again‚Äù

‚ÄúHi theres that same intrusive thought that keeps coming back, welcome back babes‚Äù

‚ÄúIntrusive thought? Bro you weren‚Äôt invited lol but common in‚Äù

‚ÄúCommon that one again, ugh I‚Äôve heard that before‚Äù

‚ÄúOh a new twist, to the same fears. You‚Äôre so annoying‚Äù

A: Accept

I accept and allow these thoughts no matter the content

I accept and allow that these thoughts are just thoughts and I can think whatever I want

R: run Towards

I can make this thought even scarier, worse, or weirder (This is to get rid of the fear, and show that its just a thought, eventually your brain gets bored and drifts into something else)

E: Engage

-Well thought you can be there but I have things to do and places to be

-Disclaimer: I am still struggling with these. I have made progress, and that is beautiful, and I want you to know you can make progress. We can work towards a better future.

**GIVE UP FEARING IT WILL LAST FOREVER. THAT IS A LIE YOUR ANXIETY IS TELLING YOU.**

If you have questions about how to help you please refer to DARE they have coaching sessions, academy, the app, a website with other people as well who can help. I'm not an expert I am just sharing my experience, hoping it can help someone."
"I've been chronically lonely for a looong time. So i decided to make an effort to change that and went to a book lovers event. I had a blast. I met so many nice people with whom i talked until my tongue went numb. I felt like i could fly.
It's very important to mention i was completly terrified about going 
""What if i get there too late?"" I thought. Ended up wasting 6$ on an uber instead of a 25 min walk just so im not late. 
I get there, I realize i dont know anyone or even how anybody looks( including the coordimator). I try to message her, she doesnt answer. I get even more stressed, i think ""maybe its a traffiking scheme"" Im terrified people think im crazy for walking around aimlessly, im too coward to even ask anyone if they are there for the event or just coffee. 
Then the coordinator shows up, leads us all to our area and we all have the time of our lives. Up to that point, i was so stressed I felt sick and really wanted to just call it quits at times. 

But i didn't

I pushed through, and it was worth it."
"So I started taking anxiety meds for the first time ever this year.  With it being the holidays I've attended a few parties at other people's houses.  For the first time in my life, I didn't feel the nervousness and unease that I usually do.  I'm usually stuck in one spot and too afraid to relax enough to have a good time.  

I attended a work Christmas party at my boss's house last night which would usually be extremely nerve wracking for me.  But I was fine.  I was able to have a good time with my coworkers and it was so nice. 

Is this what normal people without anxiety are like?"
"My father died by suicide a week back. The police did a post-mortem; my mother saw his body wrapped in a plastic. I couldn't; I didn't. 

I am afraid she might try it and she is afraid I might. I know I won't, but I feel multiple emotions, and of course anxiety is one of them. I am also feeling irritated at times because this kind of death has a different baggage.

What if my mom dies soon because of this trauma? What if she dies before paying off the loan? What if I never get out of the country? What if people cancel my visa when they do a background check and find this? What if a potential employer finds this and doesn't hire me? 

They say grit determines one's life. What if I can't utlize this incident and become stronger and better?

My father had anxiety too."
"Anyone else struggle with health anxiety? It‚Äôs terrible! But I also don‚Äôt really have any hobbies to distract myself or keep me going. How did you find hobbies? What hobbies do you have that makes you happy and allows you to not obsess over everything little weird thing in your body? 

I feel dumb that I don‚Äôt have hobbies or no what I‚Äôm passionate about.

I am medicated as well. (I have panic disorder) I got off, but I‚Äôm back on so it‚Äôs extra bad rn.

Thanks for reading!"
"I have a weird feeling in my chest- kind of like someone is pushing on my heart, but I'm pretty calm at the moment. Or I was until this started happening."

"Something about a rainy day I just find very relaxing and soothing, sometimes I enjoy just standing outside and getting wet for a bit."
"I was stuck in fight or flight for weeks, I can always tell by digestive issues. I noticed that my skin wouldn't rebound, it was like an elderly persons. My neck looked like I was 70, I could barely recognize it in the mirror. I finally broke out of it 2 days ago and it went back to normal pretty much overnight. I guess when you're in that state your body diverts everything to survival (erroneously). I've had so many weird sensations and issues since this whole thing began. The minds effect on our bodies has changed the way I look at everything. I've had cold/hot spots, phantom pains, tingles, numbness, just weird shit that comes and goes. Not a fan."
"Please. I could just really use some kind, comforting words."
Be honest! I know for me personally it hasn't really stopped. I still feel the same way. Maybe not as extreme but the symptoms are there nonetheless.  Especially those really bad health anxiety symptoms and panicking constantly and overthinking. Wish I could talk to more people about this...
"Often I actually stress about the fact that I stress so much, just curious if anyone else has this? It‚Äôs funny how consuming anxiety can really be, it‚Äôs almost like a perpetual loop "
"I have had anxiety ever since middle school, and whenever it spikes I start gagging to the point I sometimes end up throwing up. Does this happen to anyone else? Just curious. I'm at work as I write this currently fighting back gags, since today has been a bit anxiety inducing for me. "
My anxiety hasn‚Äôt stopped for a month now and im wondering if this is normal and if it will go away
Which one works better for you? Walking two hours or Jogging for half an hour or HIIT?
""
"I am just exhausted. For years now I have lived with extreme anxiety, with endless catastrophizing and obsessive thoughts. I have tried medication, self help books, therapy, cbt. Nothing seems to work. Any ideas? Am I alone in this ridiculous amount of worry? "
"But if you're on this sub,have chronic anxiety, and still drink, then you need to cut out the alcohol. I have been in denial about alcohol for 25 years. Been off it a month and already seeing the benefits. It's a neurotoxin, literally killing your nervous system."
"I just thought I‚Äôd share some big news that‚Äôs making me brick myself.

I‚Äôve been slowly reintroducing the cinema back into my life after having a panic attack there. It causes a lot of anxiety because my brain seems convinced it‚Äôs dangerous and will kill me or something.

Well today I just bought an unlimited card from Cineworld, this has given me the motivation to not get scared and stay at home but instead see at least 2 movies a month.

I don‚Äôt recommend doing this if you‚Äôre just starting out but for me who‚Äôs been slowly working their way up to this I feel so proud, I actually can enjoy the cinemas again!

I still get nervous before it starts don‚Äôt get me wrong but once I get invested the fear starts to fade. It‚Äôs addicting to stomp out my brains dumb reaction like this!"
"I was in a TK Max store today looking for a coffee body scrub. Upon walking in a woman brushed by me in a rush to answer her phone and left the store. I excused her, understanding the desire not to take a phone call in such a public space. I instantly forgot about the exchange and started my pursuit of a coffee scrub.

I was immediately overwhelmed and overstimulated the second I looked at the shelves, stacked 5 high and over 5 meters long. The more I looked for the scrub, the harder it was to find one. Everything was colour-coded and bright, and hard to decipher. Finally, after reading the back of eight products and over 10 minutes later, I decided on a sugar scrub (no coffee scrub was available it seemed).

Then off I went, deeper into the aisles to peruse everything in the store; it's what I like to do when I go to TK Max, scour every aisle until I find something interesting. I always start at the front of the store, where the beauty products are, and continue down each aisle until I move on to the clothing. Off I went, in my own world, questioning over and over again if I had chosen the correct product while browsing everything else on offer (my brain is one of those overthinking ones that doesn't shut up). With 2 products in hand, I ventured away from the wall and then I heard it, a voice nearby. Unaware someone was close to me, I turned, searching for someone in conversation. I briefly saw a woman standing alone, out of the corner of my eye. After glimpsing her alone, I figured I must have imagined the voice, but I heard a mumble again. I dismissed the noise knowing there was only one person near me. After weighing up the advantages of each product, I discarded one and turned to the jewellery area, when I heard it again. Determined to work out if I was slowly losing my mind, I turned again, focusing on the only individual within proximity. She made eye contact quickly and spoke louder, this time I could hear her. ""Ohhh the stalker is staring at me, stop stalking me!"" she said. Stunned, I looked away, wondering who was stalking this woman, there was only herself and me in the beauty area. I instantly became worried, my anxiety peaking, I thought she might not be all there in the head, and wandered off to the jewellery section.

As I looked at the jewellery, I couldn't stop thinking about the woman, and who was ""stalking"" her. It was then I realised, that the woman who brushed by me upon my entry was the exact woman who was being stalked. As someone overly aware of their surroundings, this late realisation startled me. And then it occurred, I processed what the woman had said. She thought I was stalking her! I instantly felt sick, I wanted to go and fight her and argue that I was the last person on Earth to stalk someone, that it's not who I am, that I'm a good person, and why the fuck, would I want to stalk some older weird woman, but I didn‚Äôt. I was scared and wanted to leave, but I wanted to prove I wasn‚Äôt a stalker more than my desire to leave, and so I stayed shopping for the next hour, bouncing between disassociating and racing thoughts. 

More than 10 hours have passed and I am still rattled. I do not understand the emotions that I am experiencing, it feels almost like heartache, for someone to judge and attack me so quickly. My tongue is in my throat, my cheeks are burning with tears, and my anxiety wants my head over a toilet bowl."
"I had a really bad panic attack yesterday, and still feel some anxiety lingering this morning. Probably just scared to have another panic attack (health/heart anxiety). Any advice? What do you guys do when you‚Äôre having bad anxiety days? I don‚Äôt want to just wallow in it. I have therapy in a few days, but in the meantime."
"Also what happens if you're constantly reminded and faced with the trigger for your anxiety. Life you know what you're capable of and have shown it before,but ever since anxiety you can't do it again. Do you just accept it or try to overcome it.if yes ,how?"
"I almost didn't go because of social anxiety.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  The congregation has always been nice.

I failed out of college due to depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.  I've gained OVER 200 lbs due to sitting on my ass all day and drinking/smoking so much weed that I was basically comatose.  I wore no makeup because I didn't want to sweat it off.  They still recognized me and told me I'm beautiful!  I got so many hugs.  They know the gist of my struggles because my parents leaned on them for support.

There was no judgement.  Just joy.  And it was so much fun seeing the additions built onto the church.  I usually watch the sermons online, so I finally got to meet the preacher!  He said that he's heard so much about me and that he's proud of me.

Wow...  It was nice.  I was dreading it, but I wanted to try it again.  I'm glad I went."
"My lifestyle is very passive. I don't ""attack"" the day. My life doesn't feel real. The moment feels blurred. It's not real. Every day is 1:1 the same. My life is monotonous. I barely do anything and act like it's out of my control. I live as if someone else is controlling my life, as if there's nothing I can do about it other than whine. I'm ashamed of myself. Sometimes I don't want to be seen outside because I carry this shame inside me. I know others can't see inside me. Still, I feel uncomfortable going out.

What can I do about it?"
"I'll start. I was once trying to voice my opinion about a work matter at work to my supervisor, with multiple coworkers nearby. I was really anxious and started stuttering and speaking out of order. Right when I stopped myself and tried to restart to say what I was trying to say properly, my supervisor blurted out to me ""Are you from Africa? Do you speak English?"" I was so shocked and embarrassed, again coworkers were in the area and in earshot, I said nothing and frowned. She then said ""Could you stop talking?"" And that was that."
Just curious when everybody developed there anxiety disorder ? And did it get worse fast ?
"DPDR is one of my least favorite anxiety symptoms, yet it's the hardest to explain. It's such an isolating thing and makes me feel like I'm going crazy "
"Hey y‚Äôall, I know this might be a broad statement, but on many platforms, people are taking this ‚Äúdoomsday‚Äù approach right now, specifically talking about all the horrible natural disasters occurring at the same time right now. They are stating that they ‚Äújust feel like something really bad is about to happen‚Äù.

If this stresses you out (I know it does for me!) I recommend staying off social media, especially tik tok and twitter, and just spending time with your family. Things aren‚Äôt great right now, however it is not the end of the world. Please do not let them scare you.

It‚Äôs honestly making me sick to my stomach to think about it right now after being exposed to it all, however the best thing to do is to distract yourself.

Edit: 
Some good ways to distract yourself is to play crosswords, sudoku, daily NYT games, watch your favorite (comforting) youtubers, cuddle with your pets, watch old kids cartoons, do schoolwork/study, play video games, etc.

It‚Äôs currently late at night where I live, and despite enjoying it to be quiet when I sleep, sleeping with background chatter is always a good way to not feel so alone when these thoughts pop up.

Good luck to all of us! Hopefully the upcoming days will be better! "
"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety and panic attacks for most of my life, but this year, I‚Äôve been putting in a lot of effort to break the cycle‚Äîand I‚Äôm finally starting to feel like I‚Äôm making progress! Last month, I was able to travel and stay away from home twice without experiencing a panic attack, which is a huge win for me.

Some of the things that have been really helpful for me this year are lifting weights at the gym being the biggest help by far and reading two great books: *Hope and Help for Your Nerves* and *Dare*.

I‚Äôm curious‚Äîwhat‚Äôs been the most effective for you in reducing your anxiety or managing panic attacks? Whether it's an activity, a book, or even a mindset shift, I‚Äôd love to hear what has worked for you.

Let‚Äôs share what‚Äôs helped us so we can all learn from each other!"
"What has your brain convinced you that you're dying from this week? 

I'll go first...

That I have some random heart rhythm issue or SVT. Always in my heart attack era over here. "
"It's a feeling I've been feeling more and more lately. A while ago I told my wife (jokingly) that  it would be nice if I could just decide to spend the weekend on coma. So no thinking, no nothing. And then just decide to wake up on monday morning"
"I always had health anxiety from the age of about 11 but it went away for a few years. At age 16 I started showing symptoms of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome type 3 and doctors constantly told me nothing was wrong. 2 years later I was diagnosed with it, I‚Äôm 23 now and that whole experience has made it hard to trust doctors despite being involved with some fantastic ones since.

I‚Äôm also a sufferer of happiness anxiety - basically when things are going well or are about to start going well I get awful anxiety that something will happen to ruin it.

Last may I got symptoms of what I thought was MS, I was lucky to get an MRI done fast and it came back clear, was told it‚Äôs probably Functional Neurological Disorder. Fast forward to last month I started having the symptoms again, saw a doctor after a 10 hour A&amp;E wait when my lips went numb and I was reassured once again.

3 days ago I noticed a tiny lump in my groin area that was painless, not red and under the skin. It didn‚Äôt present the way ingrown hairs had in the past so alarm bells regarding the C word started ringing.

I had a doctors appointment today, was told it‚Äôs not the worst case scenario or any scenario for that matter. It‚Äôs an ingrown hair that is painless due to the lack of nerve endings in that area. I‚Äôve been put back on beta blockers for anxiety.

I have now put myself on a googling ban for the foreseeable future. No more ever googling symptoms , I can‚Äôt keep going through this day after day.

Things are lining up well for me rn, I‚Äôm getting my life on track and I‚Äôm determined to stop sitting in this room whilst life passes me by , rubbish piling up around me and convincing myself I‚Äôve got all these awful , terrifying diseases.

So yeah, that‚Äôs my vent for today, hope you‚Äôre all ok üñ§"
"I‚Äôve had anxiety since I was a little kid, but I‚Äôve also had other secondary behaviors I‚Äôve always associated with my anxiety that I haven‚Äôt seen talked about as much in an anxious context, for example; Pica, self harm, dermatillomania and trichotillomania. I‚Äôm most interested in the correlation of the latter two that are centered around ‚Äòpicking.‚Äô I‚Äôve of course heard about the ‚Äúin threes‚Äù phenomenon of mental health but I think of these behaviors less as their own issues and more as symptoms of a larger issue, as I tend to pick at the skin around my nails and pull my hair out most at times of increased stress as a way to self soothe. can anyone relate?"
"To me it seems sensible ;  this is because it works pretty much straight away and I‚Äôd me anxious about addiction so would hardly ever use it , emergency only ?

Interested in peoples opinions"
"I let my laundry build up in piles over the last month because I literally could not make it down to our laundry room to run my loads of laundry out of anxiety.

I found out the app that tracks when the laundry is done actually indicates when peak use is on the machines so I found a ""lull"" and made my way down there after I realized I had nothing left to wear and was pulling dirty clothes from my bins to rewear. I asked my partner to take a video of the room beforehand so I would know what it looked like and where I would need to go.

I went down there and there was a nice older lady reading her book waiting for her laundry to finish and she was the only one there. She spoke to me to tell me that one of the driers was not working and I almost jumped out of my skin when she started speaking because I wasn't expecting it, but it felt like a weight was removed from my shoulders. I do feel like I can go down there again. I know what to expect and hopefully my laundry can now get done in a timely fashion.

If you are struggling to run an errand or get a chore done, I feel you and  I am with you in solidarity. I never in a million years thought my anxiety would affect that aspect about my daily life but it did. And it is a process to fight it. But I think it will get better.

ETA I live in an apartment building where laundry is done in a communal style room "
"I look forward to my days off when I'm at work, but when the weekend comes around it's like... I don't really know what to do with myself?

Like I feel like I should be doing something somewhat productive but also I don't really want to do anything but that also feels like a waste of time

It sucks"
"I finally left my apartment today after 3 days! Even went to the mall and ate at the food court! 

I'm hoping I can build up to taking a walk around the block every morning -- fingers crossed lol"
"Like me, now, browsing Reddit rather than dealing with grocery shopping. 

And if so, how do you overcome it? Like I could‚Äôve done the whole thing and be on my way back home by now. But nope, I feel like I‚Äôm glued to my car seat. "
"For me I just randomly started having constant background anxiety and occasional panic attacks last month. I was just having a normal conversation with my mom when the first attack started. 

Has anything like this happened to someone else? We weren‚Äôt entirely surprised when we found out I had anxiety, because it‚Äôs hereditary in my family, but we were surprised with how random it was."
"I am 17 and thinking about having any kind of job petrifies me, it makes me feel sick. But I want to have one so badly I don‚Äôt want to end up without one and be seen by people as lazy. I‚Äôm scared I will mess up and make my co workers unhappy or they secretly will hate me. It‚Äôs just been on my mind so so much"
"Today my sister fell through a drain because it‚Äôs broken so when you stand on it. It flips. We tried to put it back in place but it wouldn‚Äôt stay when you stand on it. So we left it upright so people would see it and not fall over and hurt themselves. I then posted about it on my neighbourhood page and people responded saying I can get arrested for doing that. Because someone with poor eyesight might fall through it.

But the thing is. My sister fell through it anyway. When it was down I feel like that poses a greater risk because it‚Äôs less obvious. Even to someone who may be blind it may stop someone who has a cane from stepping on it. That was my thought process. But after I got those comments I immediately deleted the post. And my mum went down to put it back in place for me. I know this shouldn‚Äôt have upset me but it did. I get why it may have been a bad idea but yeah now I feel really embarrassed and like an awful. I feel like putting it back in place is risky too. 

I‚Äôm in my room having a panic attack. Hiding from the world. I don‚Äôt think I can show my face in public ever again. Everyone probably thinks I‚Äôm a delinquent now. And I feel like either way inevitably someone is going to get hurt whether the drain is up or down and even though it‚Äôs down now whenever someone falls through it I‚Äôll be blamed. I want to disappear and kill myself."
My doctor has told me it's very likely what has started my mental health problems 
"I feel like I‚Äôm a shell of a person I once was. Everything makes me anxious. Eating, talking on the phone, showering, taking my meds, watching tv, everything. I feel like I‚Äôm never calm anymore. My body is always tense. Is there anyone else like this? ü•∫"
"I haven‚Äôt been vaccinated in a while and this is my third time I have had covid. My at home test was negative but It feels too familiar. My husband is sick too.

I went to a party Saturday today is day five and it‚Äôs misery. I feel aches and fatigue as well as stabbing chest pain. My blood oxygen and six lead home ekg say i‚Äôm fine. So far no fever. 

I am afraid if I get checked out at the ER i‚Äôll get a secondary infection due my vulnerable immune system and die of sepsis. Im worried if I don‚Äôt go it‚Äôs a blood clot or a lung issue I won‚Äôt

"Right now, next to my feeling of weakness I've got this feeling of vertigo, that in parallel isn't vertigo.

I don't know how to explain it, but when I'm standing or walking at times, I feel just... Unstable. Not that things are spinning around me, but just that I'm unstable.

Does anyone else have this? Is this common for anxiety sufferers?"
"Hey guys.

I was on Lexapro for 2 years and it was incredible for my anxiety but I ended up getting off of it because it killed my sex drive and made me a bit too numb.

Now I‚Äôve been off lexapro for a year my brain-belly anxiety connection is back full force. 

Are there any medications that just handle anxiety that don‚Äôt kill sex drive?"
"I‚Äôm currently on Lamictal, seroquel and buprenorphine and my anxiety is most certainly NOT controlled. So my psychiatrist recently prescribed two medications. 
2 months ago she prescribed doxepin 10mg to help with sleep and I fucked up and googled the side effects and because I have some mild cardiac issues I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to take it. I was/am so scared that I knew if I took it I would probably have a goddamn panic attack and increase symptoms that may or may not even exist.

The joys of being crazy, I guess.

Well she wants me to try 10mg Prozac that I picked up yesterday from the pharmacy. I had done really good as to not google‚Ä¶. Until this morning. Well I googled and now I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt tolerate it well. I‚Äôm scared of so many things.. I hate this so bad. 

I need some relief from my anxiety. Because nothing has helped, really. The seroquel has helped me some, I think.. but I‚Äôm still a mess. 

What do I do!??"
"I‚Äôm open to hear any and all suggestions. I‚Äôm currently on medication but I‚Äôd love if I could eventually come off that (sertraline).

I‚Äôd like to note that sertraline has been enormously helpful, with no hugely noticeable side effects. But I‚Äôm asking as an fyi because I think there needs to be more discussion around alternative therapy and natural treatments"
Especially after dinner time?
"I woke up feeling like a weight was lifted. Like all the anxiety &amp; depression I typically feel during the holidays is gone &amp;, damn, it feels good!"

"So, I have horrific anxiety surrounding my heart, all because I‚Äôm 34 and keep seeing things about ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù people suddenly dying from cardiac arrest. I literally don‚Äôt even wanna go anywhere anymore that‚Äôs how scared I am. I went through this pretty bad in 2019, freaked out and went to a cardiologist, who pretty much told me he could tell everything was heavily influenced by my anxiety, but he would run some tests anyway. Like 3 EKGs, an echo, and a calcium score test later, they said everything was in perfect working order and they didn‚Äôt wanna see me again unless something was really wrong. 

This month alone, I‚Äôve had my regular physical and bloodwork done, had an EKG done (which was perfect), and been examined by 3 different doctors. I have another cardiologist appointment against everyone‚Äôs advice that I may cancel, but ugh. This crap is exhausting.

"So after years of trying to find ""the cure"" to my anxiety.. I realised that it was right under my nose this whole time. Please take some time to read this.

In very short, the key is self acceptance, compassion and kindness. Learning how to love yourself unconditionally. I know you might be skeptical right now but I promise that you need to hear this. Let me start by saying that what I've written here is universal and a lot of it applies to everyone, not just to people who are going through a hard time with anxiety.

You don't suffer from anxiety. You suffer from your REACTION to it.

EVERYONE feels fear. EVERYONE feels anxiety. It's normal. It's human. And fearing from anxiety is **the most** human thing. You don't suffer from the anxiety. You suffer because of the way you perceive it. You tell yourself that it's not okay. That it's not normal. You feel guilt and shame for feeling it. You see it as a bad thing. You are scared for your life to feel it.

Right now Millions of people are having an anxiety attack. Millions are feeling so much anxiety. Millions are going through the same experience as you. Feeling so alone and defective. Feeling shame and guilt just for being an innocent human being with normal feelings.

Know this. **Your anxiety is not special**. Your experience is not unique. Your thoughts and self dialog are not unique. The sleepless nights that feel like the end of the world, the feeling of dread, the racing thoughts, the dizziness. You are not alone no matter how alone you might feel right now.

**The things that make us feel the loneliest ARE the things that are the most common for all of us** and what connects us all - feelings such as guilt, shame, and also anxiety and depression. These are things that we all have experienced in our life, or experiencing right now. But these are also the things we hide from others, because we are too ashamed to admit it and too scared to be judged. Look at this sub alone. It has 661k people in it. Videos about how to ""heal"" or ""deal"" with anxiety on YouTube have millions of views. We all feel so alone in our experience while we all feel the same. It's so absurd, funny even in a vicious way.

When we see these feelings as bad or negative, this is when we will start trying to avoid feeling them. What happens when you try not to think about something? You will only think about it. Stop chasing after feeling good all the time. You are allowed to feel like sh\*t.

If you were not supposed to feel this way, then why do you? Because you were you born this way. We are wired to have those feelings. You are just like everyone else. You cannot be angry at yourself for that. Anxiety is not bad. It's just a feeling. Negative thoughts are not bad. They are just negative. They are things that just happen as a result of you being human.

\*\*\*\*The first step is to be **MINDFUL** of your thoughts. This means to know and to be aware of what you are thinking, recognise the anxious thoughts when they arise, and accept them as a part of your brain proccess. Thoughts just come up. Anxious thoughts just come up. It just happens. It's normal. Catch your brain when it starts spiralling and starts it's self dialog about anxiety. It's harder to talk sense to yourself when you are already in panic, because you are immersed in the feeling of danger.\*\*\*\*

**Sometimes you will feel anxiety, maybe when you meet new people, maybe for the stupidest reason and maybe for no reason. And that's okay. It just happens. But it is your job to be there for yourself. Speak to yourself in a gentle manner. Tell yourself ""oh, that made you feel anxious, didn't it?"", ""It's totally normal to feel what you feel. I'm here for you love"". Always make sure to listen to yourself. Ask yourself ""Are you comfortable doing this? It's okay if you are not. Whatever you feel like‚ô•"". ""I'm so happy that you are here with me!"". Hug yourself. Realise how innocent you are. You are giving your 100% right now. Appreciate yourself for that. If you knew better, you would have acted on it.**

""But what if I stay this way my entire life?""

Let me tell you a secret. This might be a little harsh, but I feel like many of us need to hear this. Your life is not that important. You might feel anxiety right now, but it doesn't matter. The world will just keep revolving. Millions of people are suffering right now. Some feel depressed and can't get out of their bed, some are stressed over things that won't matter tomorrow, some are crying in the shower, some are struggling with their body image, some feel so small and unworthy (some = countless of people).. you get it. **We all suffer**. We all have problems we are dealing with right now. This is the ""curse"" or ""gift"" that life is.

We are all going towards the same destination anyway. Yes, we are all destined to die. Maybe today, maybe tomorrow, maybe in 50 years. You and your loved ones might be gone by tomorrow. And it won't change a thing - we are all nothing in this universe. In 100 years you and everyone you know will be gone and no one will care. You might think this is a pessimistic thing to say, but it isn't. it's realistic. In fact, the most important people on earth right now, the richest, the most famous, might be gone by tomorrow, and it won't really affect anyone or change their life course. Would it change your life in any way?

So you will suffer your entire life. So you will waste your entire life. Big deal. So many did before you. You are just another person. You will die anyway. So feel what you feel. Feel like sh\*t. Feel awesome. It won't change a thing. Not now, not in 5 years and not in 100 years. And if there is no point - then you are free to just exist. Just feel whatever it is that you are feeling. Nothing that you do will change the order of the universe.

When you realise that nothing you do, think or feel really has an impact and that your days here are limited, it might start to feel a little pointless to even worry about things you said yesterday, or feel guilt for your experience. Like it's gonna end anyway, so why bother? This is when you start feeling grateful for any experience that you are going through. You just notice it, without judging it. You accept it as something that will pass and won't be remembered.

You don't need to ""let go"" of anxiety. Be okay with yourself even **when** you feel anxiety. Get good at feeling uncomfortable. Learn to even love it. Tell yourself ""you are SO human, and I love you just for that!"". Remember, THIS moment is perfectly fine.

Bodily discomfort is just a bodily discomfort. It's a temporarily state. Do you think you are gonna remember this moment in 5 years? Will it matter? Is it gonna affect your life in any way? Life changes all the time. We forget what we felt yesterday so quickly. What you feel right now is not what you are gonna feel tomorrow. Today you might feel confident, and tomorrow you might feel less confident. And that's okay. The point is to learn to love yourself no matter what. No matter what you feel, think, say. Love yourself unconditionally.

**You are not perfect. Whatever you feel right now is okay and allowed and was felt by millions of others before you. You are imperfect. You can make mistakes. You don't have to say the right thing all the time. You don't have to feel good all the time. You are human. You are a f\*\*\*ing human. And you deserve unconditional love JUST FOR THAT.**

Stop labeling yourself. You are not an ""anxious person"". You just don't accept this part of you as normal. You just don't have the tools and perspective. Tomorrow this might change. Heck, maybe even today. Maybe right now.

When I finally felt this love and compassion towards myself, when I just let things be without judging whether they are good or bad, I thought to myself - I didn't even realise that you could love yourself this way! I didn't realise how much shame and guilt I carried within myself for feeling anxiety or having certain thoughts. I used to beat myself down, feeling like a victim, thinking ""but I just wanted to enjoy life! Why I am so miserable? What's wrong with me?"" Now I realise that there was absolutely nothing wrong. I suffered because I judged this feeling. I judged and criticized myself. I was so harsh with myself AND others. Instead, now I try to have an honest conversation with myself.

Learn to have a honest conversation with yourself. It could be useful when feeling overwhelmed. Ask yourself: ""What are you feeling right now? You can tell me everything"" in the most non-judgemental way possible. Get comfortable with being vulnerable with yourself. It might feel very cringe at first, but trust me, you get used to it.

Negative thougts just happen! Laugh at them!!üòÇüòÇü§£üòÇ They are so hysterical!

**Whenever a difficult thought arises**, whenever you feel anxiety, tell yourself:

It's okay. Feel anxiety. You're allowed to. It's human. I love you. I am always here for you.

Some resistance might arise when you say that. Take a deep breath and accept these thoughts too by repeating ""I love you"", including all these thoughts and resistance. Let it be. Laugh at this human nature and how stupidly imperfect we all are.

If the anxiety is really strong right now and you cannot think properly, just note to yourself that once you feel better you will be back and you will always be there for yourself. Let the anxiety run its course now and know that eventually you will have yourself again. You always have a place to come back to. Someone to lean on.

Treat yourself gently like you would treat a good friend, a child, a pet. A toddler. In a way, it's almost like reparenting yourself. Reassure yourself with kind words. You are just as innocent, and deserving of love and kindness. Develop your own positive self dialog. Say the things that you feel you might need to hear. Always be there for yourself no matter what.

Don't love yourself despite of feeling anxiety and fear, love yourself BECAUSE of that. Because what you feel is normal and understandable. Every bit of it.

**There is no cure for being human. So stop apologizing for being one.**

"I know at first this seems like a normal thing; anxiety lies to you and of course you'll be anxious about people liking or not liking you. thats not what i mean. i mean is it normal to think that having anxiety is the reason why people are mad at you? for me, i feel like others think im dramatic and unreliable since sometimes i suddenly get anxious and back out of things i seemed fine with before. i think this makes me annoying to other people. im not seeking reassurance that im not annoying, rather, i'd like to know if people really get angry at others for having anxiety, or if this is more of a thing anxiety tells you than an actual concern."

Thought I had exposure to rabies (I didn‚Äôt) and my anxiety got so bad I went to the er for the shot. The guy basically calmed me down and told me I didn‚Äôt need it and the shot would make me more anxious cuz of the side effects. He said there was no scratch or bite and I would be okay. I felt better but the reason for coming was put down as ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù üò≠üò≠ can‚Äôt wait for the bill.
"So I have had anxiety over the last two years about walking alone, especially in public at night.
This was mainly down to a lot of harassment and sexual violence I've suffered the past two years. 

If I go out then I need my location on to at least one friend and preferably on the phone to someone. I'd struggle to go out to the garden in the evening. 

Now this may not seem like a big deal but I went to put the bins out (communal refuse) and instead of walking into my house, I just kept walking. I didn't go out for long but I didn't have my phone on me. I didn't tell anyone I was going to have a walk at 11pm. 

While out, I felt... at peace? I even heard someone walking behind me but I wasn't scared, just ""aware""

I don't know if I should be proud or if I've just been incredibly dumb."
"I've been struggling with anxiety over a year and im a coffee addict. Realizing that it triggers my anxiety to the point of panic attack i tried decaffeinated coffee and its the best thing ever. Even most of the cafes make decaffeinated coffee and IT TASTES THE SAME. No difference at all. For my anxious buddies out there, you dont have to quit coffee, enjoy your late night coffees."

It's expensive, or when you do find someone or have the money, they have zero appointments until a month or more from now. People wonder why this country has a depression and suicide epidemic, it's because most people cannot afford, or cannot find even a sliver of help. "
"I have been struggling to go outside without genuine anxiety and fear for a while. I am unsure why, but its almost a fear. I work myself up and think about all the things that could go wrong. Normally I would stay inside. But today I wanted to see nature, I noticed it was raining.. Then I stepped outside. Relief. I made it.  
I was safe out there.  
The rain was beautiful and luring me in, I had more incentive to go out due to this, as I doubted I would see anyone else. It was tranquil, peace, and I love nature. I wish I did not deprive myself of the beauty around me due to my own heads issues. I am my own person and I will overcome this. I went outside today for an hour."
"I'm dealing some weird neuropathy sensations in my hands and wrists and was wondering if anxiety might be a possibility. I've been to a number of different doctors and neurologists, and they've each said there's no sign of any kind of actual issue like carpal tunnel. The tingling/electric sensations are so intense, I find it hard to believe that mental issues alone are the cause of it, but it also seems to be the only answer at this point. Has anyone else had to deal with similar issues?"

"I‚Äôm 23F. I have no history of addiction, my parents aren‚Äôt addicts. I only smoked marijuana in high school, and after turning 22, I barely drink. I might go to an outing at the bar every other month or so and have 1 or 2 drinks. My anxiety has only gotten worse over time. I started my therapy and medication journey in 2018. Over the course of 6 years, I‚Äôve been on prozac, lexapro, zoloft, wellbutrin, buspar, and hydroxyzine. Some did not help, others just never got me to where I wanted to be and only temporarily helped. I‚Äôve also been on and off with medications(like on medication for 6-10 months and then wean off and stop taking anything for awhile), and have had multiple therapists and psychiatrists. I know you can‚Äôt be prescribed heavier stuff over the phone, so I finally found an in person psychiatrist I was able to see in just a couple weeks. I was 2 mins from my appointment when I get a call that he‚Äôs sick and can‚Äôt come in. So I went into the office anyway and used their iPad to do a video visit. He wants to put me on Effexor. I told him my anxiety is SO bad that I‚Äôm barely able to drive without freaking out, I can‚Äôt go grocery shopping alone anymore, I‚Äôve been out of work since December because of how bad it is. I feel dizzy and like I‚Äôm going to pass out any time I go into public. It‚Äôs ruining my life. He said I have MDD, GAD, and Panic disorder. And that Effexor and therapy will help. Why are doctors so against prescribing heavier things, even at low doses? I feel like none of these SSRI‚Äôs and SNRI‚Äôs are doing anything and I feel like there‚Äôs no hope of me ever getting better. And for those of you who are/have been on Effexor for anxiety with similar symptoms of mine, has it helped?"

"I officially hate Christmas and I‚Äôve realized that I‚Äôve hated Christmas for more then a decade. Ever since my dad died, it isn‚Äôt worth it. My dad was the one that loved Christmas.

"It's 4 am here and I couldn't sleep so I decided to make this post. Hope this helps some of you.

First of all I've suffered from anxiety (general anxiety, social anxiety, health anxiety) severely for more than 1 year non-stop. I've got all the physical effects (dizziness, air hunger, shortness of breath, hearth palpitations, loss of appetite and many others that I can't remember right now.) I couldn't even leave my room at that period of my life. It was terrible. I literally wasted that period of time thanks to anxiety.

Over the time, I overcame my anxiety without using an anti depressant because I was too afraid to use an anti depressant even tho my doctor prescribed me one.

When I tell my friends I've suffered from severe anxiety none of them believes me. They think I'm the last person to have anxiety and I'm too social. Lmao.

Here's few things that will help A LOT with your anxiety in a few weeks. 

**1- Start exercising. Lift weight if possible. I can't tell you how much it helped me.** 

**2- Do one thing that you don't want to do, every day. It may be going outside or making a phone call or eating something you are afraid to eat (health anxiety). Just do it. Go against your fears. That's incredibly effective against anxiety. Basically you're leaving your comfort zone. You are going out with your friends but you are too scared? Then do it scared. Don't let anxiety stealing your life.** **Going towards your anxiety is where the grow begins.**

3- Stop consuming too much social media. Scrolling non stop messes with our brain. Please limit your screen time. 

4- Meditate 10 mins a day. Maybe 5 mins in mornings and 5 mins at nights.

5- Set aside 20-30 minutes for studying. It can be learning a new language, studying a new subject, history, space etc. It's up to you. Idk why but studying something release happy chemicals in the brain. 

6- Drink enough water.

Those things literally saved me. Especially regular exercising is a miracle. I can't recommend it enough. Step 2 is the second most important thing as well.

P.s. I know all the things I mentioned above are so hard to do for an anxious person but you have to do. You have to be stubborn to overcome anxiety. Anxiety only exists if you let it.

"Tomorrow morning I am having surgery for what appears to be cancer in my thyroid. I have severe health anxiety, other chronic illnesses and I‚Äôm just scared out of my mind. I need to sleep, and rest my body but all of the bad possibilities are running through my head. I‚Äôm terrified of dying. This just feels like a lot. I‚Äôve had a really good handle on my anxiety for a while, and now it‚Äôs so bad I feel sick. 

Not sure what I‚Äôm looking for by posting. Just maybe support and to get it off my chest. I know my family is tired of hearing how scared I am. 

Update: 

First, thank you for all the support I read all of them and they really helped me. üíï
I made it through surgery I was held in the hospital for a few extra hours but I am on my way home now. Nervous to be home without all the extra monitoring but I‚Äôm trying to remind myself they normally send people home immediately after this surgery and wouldn‚Äôt have kept me if they saw anything wrong. "
"I was laying in bed not doing anything, trying to fall asleep. All of the sudden, I noticed my heart started racing. And it got faster, and faster, and faster. I grabbed my blood pressure monitor and my HR was 150. I thought I was dying. I'm not sure how long it lasted because time stood still but I'd say 10-20 minutes. It felt like an eternity. I'm sitting here now sobbing. I can't keep doing this. When is it going to happen again? I'm so tired. I'm afraid my heart can't take much more."
"For the past 6 years, every time I‚Äôve felt anxious, my eating has reduced to the point where I don‚Äôt eat for a certain amount of time before feeling good enough to eat again. Even if I try to eat while feeling anxious, I end up getting sick and exhausted afterwards.

Does anyone else have an issue similar to this? I‚Äôve not been diagnosed yet so this would be really helpful to check."

Recently I‚Äôve been having OVERWHELMING anxiety and fear of death and it‚Äôs killing me it scares the fuck outta me and it makes me always worry about myself and gives me fear that I‚Äôm going to die soon I‚Äôd just like to be more open to it than to fear it constantly I just fear there‚Äôs nothing after and that‚Äôs scary to think about even if when I die I am just nothing less as I were before but I can‚Äôt live my whole life in fear of dying I‚Äôll go absolutely crazy
"i woke up really abruptly at about half five in the morning today with the overwhelming feeling that i‚Äôm going to die today. not like that feeling you get during a panic attack where you think you‚Äôre actively dying. i felt fine when i woke up, but had this massively overwhelmed sense that something was going to happen to me later and that i was going to die today. i‚Äôm trying to go about my day like normal but it keep looming over me and every little tweak and pain is sending me into a spiral cause i think it‚Äôs the start of a heart attack or a stroke or a cardiac arrest or whatever else can kill you. im terrified and i don‚Äôt wanna die. "
"okay, so I‚Äôm not diagnosed, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I have OCD. if death/time passing triggers you, please don‚Äôt keep reading, i‚Äôm specifically NOT posting this in the OCD sub because i‚Äôm slightly less likely to trigger people here and i dont want anybody to suffer like this because of me. 

 i‚Äôve had many different obsessions and chronically ruminate and it started when i was 6 after my cat unexpectedly died. 

my fear of death is so strong it prevents me from actually living my one shot at life. i recognize how stupid this is, and that i should just live my life, but guys this runs so fucking deep im a little unsure i can break free from this. 

since i turned 21 this year, this fear that was already causing me distress increased tenfold. i actually have lost any ability to be a normal human being. it sits in my head chronically now that im going to die and that ive lived about 1/4 of my life already. 

i‚Äôm sorry this is so depressing. being born just feels like a curse especially with this fear. i‚Äôve been greatly suicidal for a large portion of my life yet i know deep down i could never do it. if someone says ANYTHING about death, time, getting old, etc. honestly it could be anything, bam, the rumination kicks in and i‚Äôm going to find somewhere to cry/have a panic attack.

i have more i could say, but i honestly shouldn‚Äôt, for the sake of my sanity and also not to continue triggering myself. 

EDIT: holy shit i forgot to mention a huge detail, i almost died earlier this year before turning 21 and that has definitely made me insufferably anxious. i tried a medication for anxiety and it gave me serotonin syndrome and it was the most painful experience. i never want to experience that again, but i will eventually, and that haunts me. the unpredictability of life. being born just feels like a real cruel joke"
"I‚Äôve been awake all night, and I feel sick and about to puke. I‚Äôm so nervous for my interview today that I can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôve tried so many things to calm myself down but I can‚Äôt do it. Now, I need to go to work. 

This weekend was hard, and I didn‚Äôt expect it to be. I guess my anxiety has been really bad lately, and I‚Äôve been having a hard time calming myself down. What do you do to calm yourself down?"
"Went to the hospital yesterday because of a panic attack and the nurse there said that its all symptoms of anxiety (DPDR, wave of panic, weird intrusive thoughts etc.).

"I've been a prescription pill guy when it comes to handling my anxiety but lately I've been exploring alternatives. For anyone who uses cannabis especially smoking to handle anxiety, how does that work? Do you smoke a little once in the morning or at night before bed?

I'm sure it's somewhat different for different people but curious what the standard usage is for most people."

I delay what I have to do and it feels good, I feel I fell so deep into my comfort zone because as of now it's just staying at home. How can I fix this? Does anyone else feel it got too bad for them too?"

I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I have apologized over &amp; over and I feel that I shouldn‚Äôt have had to do that."
I‚Äôve had anxiety for the last 15 years or so. I‚Äôve tried doing it all on my own this whole time but finally reached a breaking point. Today I finally had my first session with a therapist. It was only an introduction but it feels like a huge weight was taken off my shoulders I am crying just typing this out. For the first time in who knows how long I feel hopeful for the future. Just wanted to share with reddit.
I‚Äôve had the worst anxiety for a week. I can‚Äôt even leave my house. Can‚Äôt eat. Don‚Äôt even want to drink water. Exercising makes my heart feel like it‚Äôs pounding. I‚Äôve taken Xanax but I feel like that barely helps and if it does it‚Äôs only for a short time. I‚Äôm so tired of it
It just hit me that 2025 is less than 4 months away. I‚Äôm having anxiety because I still haven‚Äôt processed past trauma from 2020 lol. It‚Äôs like everything is going so fast at once. 
"I notice when I actually feel content, that I literally get euphoric. My baseline is pretty much just anxiety. Always in the background, so much that sometimes I just think it‚Äôs my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù until I actually don‚Äôt have anxiety. "
"A few months ago, I started to get palpitations very often and a lot of chest pains. I was so worried that I started thinking I had a problem with my heart. I was constantly worrying and checking the internet, searching up my symptoms, looking for reassurance that I am okay. One day it got too much so I went to the doctors, and they diagnosed me with anxiety. They recommended that I get in touch with a therapist and put me on some special medication for my heart palpitations. After my first therapy sessions, we came to a conclusion that I have health anxiety. 
The medication helps with the symptoms and I‚Äôve been much better at dealing with my anxiety. But I have moments when one little thing happens, like I get a slight pain in my chest or I get lightheaded or I have a big headache, and suddenly I‚Äôm worrying about way too many things and can‚Äôt get out of my head. Apart from worrying, I also get lightheaded and nausea, my heart beats faster and harder, and I get a lump in my throat and my body kinda starts to go numb. It especially gets worse when I am on my period, and it feels like my anxiety is spiralling out of control and I can‚Äôt do anything about it. 
Does anyone else feel like this? "
"I have been trying to pinpoint the beginning of my struggle with anxiety for quite some time, and the only cause I can think of is a year ago when I had two very intense panic attacks on edibles where I was fully convinced I was going to die and experienced primal terror. Ever since then my life has slowly gotten worse, and I began to experience panic and anxiety while fully sober at the end of 2023 and I have been stuck in this cycle since then. Anyone have any similar experiences or ideas about this? How could I talk to a therapist about this?"
I have tried a couple of different medications and I feel like I am still not getting the support. I need anxiety what an anxiety medication have you tried that you feel like effective?
"Has anyone else found that therapy doesn‚Äôt accomplish anything? I‚Äôve gotten to several therapists, stuck with it for months, but nothing they suggest can get rid of the crushing feeling in my chest or get me to stop procrastinating. 

I have tried antidepressants in the past which helped my depression but not my anxiety. Recently I was prescribed lexapro and I started taking it but my anxiety got so much worse that I had to stop. I‚Äôm not sure where to go from here, I‚Äôm sabotaging my life and things keep getting worse and worse. Is there any real solution to anxiety? I am a graduate student and I‚Äôm spiraling because I can‚Äôt focus at all to work on my research, but if I quit I would have nothing to show for my time here and very poor job prospects. 

I don‚Äôt know how everyone else just goes about life without worrying."
"This time, it's real.

I've said this every time, but really, I think this one's real. Or maybe it's not? I can't tell. For as long as I can remember, I've never been able to determine whether my symptoms are real or not. Because I'm able to convince myself of aches and pains, of shortness of breath or certain reactions. It's terrifying to never be able to trust yourself and your body.

You may be wondering just what cancer I have, or how I know I have cancer.

Well, this time, instead of brain cancer, leukemia, or some obscure, rare cancer, I now am positive I have cancer that's metastasized throughout my lungs, stomach, intestines, and colon. And I know this because I had two tiny, needle point-sized dots of blood on my toilet paper a few weeks ago. I have dark stool sometimes, and that could be black rather than dark brown meaning digested blood and, therefore, internal bleeding from cancer. I sometimes experience constipation or diarrhea at random. There are times where I'm not hungry even if I've not eaten all day, and there are times when my stomach grumbles very loudly, making my intestines feel bubbly and bloated. My movements, and their frequency or lack thereof, have changed recently. Sometimes, it feels as if my bowels aren't fully evacuated, a sign of obstruction and cancer. Finally, I'm struggling to take a deep breath at times.

Never mind that my family has an undiagnosed yet very obvious IBS / similar issue.

Never mind that my doctor has otherwise said I'm healthy.

Never mind that this breathing issue only occurs when I think about it, or when I notice it after running upstairs and become winded.

Never mind that I have asthma, too.

Never mind that I've never visibly shat blood before this, and the past experience was likely because I made a teeny tiny tear in my ass from wiping seven times since I ran out of wet wipes and had to use regular paper instead.

Never mind a lot of things, because those are the obvious answers. Those are explanations. I don't want to hear explanations since explanations make people overlook issues. Make people think ""oh, it's just XYZ"" and then they never get checked. No, this is how I *know* I have cancer. I must. Because if I forcibly calm myself down and think logically, what if I ignore all the warning signs? What if I do indeed have cancer that's throughout my whole body or even in one small area, and it'll spread and become fatal after I tell myself ""it's just XYZ""?

This may make some of you laugh or roll your eyes. But, for me, this is a daily, debilitating paranoia. It's to the point where I can't tell the difference between black and brown stool, can't remember what it looks like, can't differentiate between the two colors when I look into the goddamn toilet every morning and stare at my shit, making myself nauseated by the sight but forcing myself to do so *because I can't tell.* I can't tell the difference between the colors. You show me those shades any day and, as an artist, I can tell you the difference. But when I'm looking at my feces in a bowl of water, I suddenly can't tell, I suddenly have no clue, I'm suddenly seeing and/or remembering dark spots that are blood and, thus, not ulcers or something reasonable but, rather, cancer.

Don't worry, I'll be seeing a therapist sometime soon I'm hoping, but for now, I'll vent here, cry in the shower, and maybe drug myself with my hydroxyzine so I stop feeling..."
"Been having some mild anxiety attacks on and off for the past few months, and today I realized that it mostly happens in the mornings to afternoon, probably from 9 to 2 o clock. My work isn't terribly stressful and most of my anxiety attacks have revolved around my relationships with people close to me. 

Once I get home and from about 4 o clock and onward I'm usually fine, though as I'm writing this up I'm starting to feel that balloon on my chest swell up, probably just causing I'm thinking about. 

Why would my anxiety be worse in the mornings? "
"I usually hit that point, where anxiety makes me just tremble in front of others‚Ä¶.. It‚Äôs so frustrating at times, especially with strangers‚Ä¶"
"I feel like I tear up so easy, in both happy and sad situations. I feel like my still lack of proper control of my anxiety contributes to this. Anyone else out there like this?"
"this can be therapy, a realization you had, tactics/methods you use, your mentality, meditation, etc. I would love to know for my own motivation lol üòî"
"I feel so sick. the world is very chaotic right now and it's hard to even breathe. I keep having panic attacks almost every hour every time I even see anything on social media. I feel so lost and don't know how much longer I can do this for :(

edit: I should also mention that I have autism. so understanding social media posts and the world is very scary for me:(

another edit 2: this is my first official reddit post and I didn't expect to get so much support! posting and being vulnerable like this has never been easy for me. so I appreciate all the kind words from everyone in the comments &lt;3. it'll take a long while for me to truly feel okay, but I'm willing to take the steps to finally find my peace! whether that be continuing to draw my digital anime art... writing, or even other posts. I will keep going the best I can. and ik you all can too &lt;3"
I am absolutely terrified of fireworks. The noise gives me so much anxiety and will sometimes send me into an attack. Every year when the 4th of July roles around I have to lock myself in my closet with a pile of pillows and blankets for comfort. I also try to play music through my headphones to help but I can still hear those dreaded firework booms. Does anyone have any tips or tricks to help? I‚Äôm also thinking of asking my doctor for an emergency anti-anxiety/panic medication or sedative to help me. I just hate fireworks so much because they impede my ability to function normally for at least 3-4 days.
For me its been better. It was worst 2 days ago. So tell us yours! 
"Let me start by saying I‚Äôm a heavy cannabis user. I‚Äôve been using medical cannabis for roughly 10 years to help deal with my anxiety and depression. I am also expecting the birth of my first child within the next 10 weeks, I‚Äôm very excited to be a father but have also been anxious about it. 

 Up until a few weeks ago I was using cannabis nearly every day. Then I started to randomly get intense panic attacks (Heavy breathing, rapid heartbeat, feelings of dying, sweating, dizziness, etc), I thought it may just be a fluke so I tried other products I have used before without problem and found myself in the same situation. It got so bad that I would start shaking violently almost like a seizure. I actually visited the heart hospital and was assured everything looked fine and testing was normal, they said it was weed induced anxiety. I spoke with my primary care doctor and she recommended and tolerance break and doubled my SSRI daily dosage (Effexor 75mg).

I guess the reason I‚Äôm asking is to see if anyone else has had this happen or what they ended up doing? I love cannabis, I grow it, cook with it, and use it in a lot of social situations. I‚Äôm on Day 4 of a tolerance break and feel good. Still slightly anxious but it gets better day by day. I‚Äôm willing to quit smoking for the better of my health but it‚Äôs a real bummer to give up something I‚Äôve enjoyed so much."
"The ones I am aware of, lowered immune system, damaged congestive capabilities, cardiovascular problems.

what else?"
"Hey, so recently I got put on clonazepam for anxiety, and a big thing with that I was told was that it can make the take feel drowsy and stuff. However, despite me taking it before bed and having gotten around 9-10 hours of sleep, I‚Äôm still finding myself feeling sort of low energy and out of it. Is this normal? Is it just the anxiety that I‚Äôm still calming down from?"
"Hello everybody. I wanted to post this because I wanted to remind you all of something. You are stronger than your anxiety. This is not your fault, this is temporary. I also posted a similar message of reassurance under r/emetophobia because I want to help people on here and I want them to be reminded of their worth. I promise you, whoever‚Äôs reading this, yes you, you will find happiness again. You aren‚Äôt in this permanently. You will find your way back, no matter how long it takes. I promise you, right now it may be hard to believe, nearly impossible. But remember, if recovery wasn‚Äôt a thing, then people would not be happy right now. It is so real, it is real and it exists. It is waiting for you and it is right beside you in your journey. You waking up every day and living is already proof of your existence. It matters. You matter. I love you so much and you will get through this. Kick anxiety‚Äôs a**!"
"It's kind of weird, idk. I'm just wondering if anybody has experienced something similar, and if so, I wanna hear about it "
"This post may or may not be triggering to some, so proceed with caution.

About a month ago I had a toothache. The toothache went away after maybe a week, so I thought it was fine. Then, it came back again, but went away again. This time, it‚Äôs come back really strong, and now my gums have started to swell up.

Fast forward to last night, I went to urgent care and they gave me antibiotics. I went home, took the first antibiotic, and I felt relieved. That was until the abscess on my gums started leaking and eventually it let out a ton of pus. My mom told me that it I swallowed the pus, it could kill me. I tried to spit out as much as I can, but still swallowed a good bit of it.

I went to bed, now it‚Äôs 5 in the morning and I‚Äôve woken up feeling hot and my head hurts. My first reaction is thinking the infection spread to my brain, even though only the side of my face hurts. 

I just genuinely feel unwell and sick. I‚Äôm really terrified and I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll be able to go to the dentist. The antibiotics are only for one week, and I‚Äôve had to take antibiotics like a week and a half ago for strep throat, so now I‚Äôm thinking I might be resistant to it. Any reassurance will be very appreciated!

TL;DR Had a severe toothache with gum swelling, got antibiotics, then had the abscess pop in my mouth and swallowed some pus. Now I have a headache and feel sick."
"There's always new good ones coming out, so I'd like your recommendations.  I struggle with panic attacks."
Does anyone have advice on waking up with horrible impending doom? Every morning I wake up with such bad dread and anxiety that something bad has or is going to happen. Any advice would be great! 
"Last year I developed a panic disorder out of nowhere, as well as a digestive disorder, and it basically ruined my life. 

- 3+ panic attacks a day
- couldn‚Äôt sleep, couldn‚Äôt eat, couldn‚Äôt drive, could barely work (even remotely)
- nothing but diarrhea
- constant sense of impending doom
- looping intrusive thoughts about how everything was falling apart
- episodes where I would just sob uncontrollably
- I was living alone at the time and suddenly being alone was when my mind would attack me the most
- sheer exhaustion. Couldn‚Äôt concentrate, couldn‚Äôt enjoy things, couldn‚Äôt think. 

I sold my house, moved home with my parents (grateful I had the option), and tried to start again. 

- my psychiatrist and I scrapped my medication regimen because it did nothing for this. 
- I‚Äôm now on a cocktail of low doses of 4 meds because my body doesn‚Äôt metabolize medications well. A full dose of 1 antidepressant can make me sick. 
- buspar, lamictal, pristiq, adderall. Between the four, the panic is quieted, and the lethargy / depression / brain fog is way less intense. 
- obviously everyone is different with medications, but buspar alone really changed my life. I wept when I started taking it and my intrusive/obsessive/looping thoughts just went‚Ä¶ quiet. 
- after I got the meds figured out I started therapy weekly. My therapist acknowledged that it‚Äôs hard to do the work when you‚Äôre already in crisis. It‚Äôs been hugely beneficial for me to talk every week and I‚Äôm grateful I have access to it. 
- I journaled every single day. Sometimes about the anxiety, but often about the good things that happened that day, or about hope, or about my goals. 
- I started working out 3x a week because I quickly realized how much less anxious i am after. When I have a bad day nowadays, I‚Äôll go out of my way to exercise because I know it helps. 
- I leaned on family and friends for the first time ever. I hate feeling like I ‚Äúowe‚Äù people, so I typically didn‚Äôt ask for much, but they really, really showed up in a life-saving way. 
- I‚Äôve changed my priorities these days. Is it improving my life? Does it bring me joy? Does it mess with my stability? 
- I listen to my body now. When I feel extra anxious, i run through a checklist (HALT) and address any issues
- I no longer fight / avoid the anxiety, because it only gives it more control over me. If it happens it happens, and I‚Äôll sit through it out of sheer stubbornness. It‚Äôs helped give me some agency back. 

It took an entire year of this to get back to a stable place (June 23 - June 24) and it‚Äôs a constant work in progress / upkeep. 

I hope literally any of this helped - there‚Äôs only so much I can put in one post, but please know that it CAN really get better, it just might suck a WHOLE lot for a while first. I‚Äôll try to answer any questions when I can. Keep going!

"I have finally reached the point where my anxiety is under control and i no longer need to be on here. Over the past year my anxiety was becoming so horrific that i had to quit my job and isolate myself for months until i finally faced the fact that my mental health was shocking and i needed help.

Fast forward to now after being prescribed an SSRI (Excitalopram/Lexapro) and going to therapy and i'm doing so much better! I never even knew what life was like without crippling anxiety until now and i hope this gives someone hope that things can get better and there are resources out there if you're struggling.

"30 F 

Lately I have been having dissociation quite a bit and since I feel so tired, I am concerned. I did my blood tests a month ago and they were mostly fine except I got diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis and as a thalassemia beta minor. My ferritin levels were very low. It was 5, should have been 50. It has been a week since I started medication but I still feel so shitty. Apart from that I just take Venlafaxine. Is this normal?

"I am 36yrs old- mom of 4 and I‚Äôve always been on some type of substance.

I‚Äôve tried all types of antidepressants, benzos, amphetamines, bipolar meds‚Ä¶I‚Äôm at a loss. I wake up everyday and my first thought is‚Ä¶‚ÄùHow can I feel different?‚Äù It runs in my mind all day long‚Ä¶‚Äùshould I smoke?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there a pill I can take‚Äù ‚Äúshould I try ordering meds online?‚Äù It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm just one big ball of addiction to an imaginary fix.

"So I posted this morning asking if anyone gets anxiety the morning after drinking

Tonight I went out to a concert tonight and drunk again. I only had two drinks but like last night I started feeling increasingly anxious towards the end of the night. Now I‚Äôve just got home and am lying in bed feeling really stressed out. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm worried about feeling anxious / hungover tomorrow or if I‚Äôm already suffering the withdrawal effects of the alcohol

I feel really rubbish and panicked. I regret drinking again but it‚Äôs the thing that initially makes me feel better from my anxiety for a bit. I know some people might say quit drinking but honestly I don‚Äôt want to. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm reliant on it but it‚Äôs nice to be able to have a couple of drinks in social situations. It‚Äôs just really hard :("

"Just wanted to point out to all of you out there that are suffering from anxiety, or any other kind of mental health condition, that you are a bunch of badasses.

Seriously though. You're all real life modern warriors. You create fortresses in your heads, with knights and tall walls, forever holding off the darkness. Like a beacon of light in neverending darkness. Perhaps it's a battle that will go on for the rest of your life, but that just makes you even more badass. You're not like everyone else, you're unique, you've got the battle scars to prove it. You've seen and been through things that few others have, or even could.

Here's the thing though. People that have struggled less with their mental health will never be able to understand or empathise. Don't let them fool you into thinking you're weak. You're the exact opposite of weak, you're an absolute badass. Imagine if they were put in your position, they would spiral and crash, and YOU are keeping it together, surviving. War is tiring, don't blame yourself if you don't have the energy to do what you want to do.

Even if there's nobody else in the world looking up to you, think of me, you have my respect, big time. You're my inspiration. And if there's me, there are definitely others out there that think the same.

So, keep fighting and holding off the darkness. Life is about the stories we tell, and yours is one of strength and courage."
"I know this isn't the most important problem to have when it comes to anxiety, but I wanted to share because it is causing me a lot of grief.

I have a really bad habit of: thinking about buying games, finally making a decision after considerable thought, then after immediately wanting to refund it. Even if I enjoy it, or know I'm going to enjoy it, I still feel really bad about any video game purchase.

It's not about affordability, I can easily afford a new game once in a while, it just eats at my soul:

""Did I really need to buy that?""

""You have these other games you owned you could have played instead!""

""You could have used that money for x.""

After buying a game I usually panic and ask myself these questions, then seek to get a refund for it. I have racked up so many it's hard to count. Either returning the game on Amazon, or getting a refund through Steam. And this behaviour is not exclusive to just games. I have this problem for any hobby I have. And I honestly hate it. Even though I'm technically saving money by scrutinizing these purchases, I just feel deeply unhappy that I can't just buy and enjoy something without thinking too hard about it.

Anyone go through something similar? I wish I could just turn these anxious thoughts off."
I was prescribed the highest dose of lexapro for 2 years but it did absolutely NOTHING for me. In fact I‚Äôd argue it is what made me suicidal.  My physical anxiety symptoms stayed the same. The only thing that has profoundly helped me was weed but I don‚Äôt want to be dependent on it.

edit: thank you to everyone who commented. i made sure to read everyone's reply and i appreciate them all so much. i was still feeling panicky at the appointment, but i made it through. since my cavity was in a certain spot, my dentist suggested not using the shot. it hurt a little bit in the drilling part, but overall i'm very happy with that decision! i do have to get a shot in a few months when they fill my last cavity, because of the location of it üò≠"
"This is the worst part of anxiety for me - my brain will jump to the hypothetical worst case scenario every time, and just latch onto it.

"Been a long time since I've been on reddit and now I live a busy and peaceful/enjoyable life I wanted to make sure I came back one more time to give people suffering from anxiety some hope. I used to experience absolutely horrific anxiety and all the symptoms that come with it. Every day was a living hell and it felt never ending. No-one truly understands the insanity that is an anxiety disorder unless you've lived it. Not even most therapist's really know what it's like. I used to wake up constantly scanning and dreading symptoms, had intrusive thoughts every moment of the day and in reaction I would get these intense bodily waves of fear passing through me most hours of the day. I had tinnitus and migraines, random pains and felt physically sick all the time. It was hell beyond imagination.


But here I am, on the other side, happier than I ever have been. Anxiety isn't an issue in my life anymore, my focus is back on the real world and not in my own head all day. This might sound crazy to hear but now I'm actually thankful I went through that hellish experience, because I am a FAR better person in terms of my resilience to life and appreciation for just feeling normal again. 

The journey to get to this point was long and drawn out, with a million ups and downs, but it's a journey anyone can do no matter how stuck or confused or scared you feel right now. Don't buy in to the idea that you will be like this forever. I suffered to a 10/10 degree, and I went through the absolute worst of it for years where my personality and everything stable about myself was ripped apart by anxiety. But here I am, good again. Your brain is fine, no permanent damage or changes have been done, and if you put in the time and dedication to recover you will be good again too.  "
Stop shaking bitch god damn pissing me tf off 
"When I‚Äôm really anxious I‚Äôll go days of feeling nauseous. Immediately upon waking up I feel a sense of dread, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness, fast heart rate ect. 

I‚Äôm genuinely so tired of wondering if there‚Äôs something medically wrong with me or it‚Äôs just anxiety. 
"
"So i‚Äôm dealing with anxiety from almost 2 years. I unlocked it when suddenly out of nowhere I had a panic attack and high blood pressure. Since then, I have been afraid that this will happen again, and at the slightest discomfort, I start to wait for panic attack. I take antidepressants and sometimes I feel good, sometimes I feel bad, but the panic attacks have decreased and the anxiety is not as bad.  Anyway, two days ago I was very anxious all day for no reason. I couldn't fit into my skin. In the morning I had a panic attack and had my boyfriend drive me to the hospital to give me a sedation but he didn't and instead he started calming me down and helping me breathe. My panic attack went away in about 5 minutes. I couldn't believe it, even after that we went for a walk, we went to the store and I didn't have anything. This is a small step towards success for me! I also want to tell you that it is very important to share with your loved ones because they can give you advice and reassure you. At first I also kept to myself and didn't say anything, but now my boyfriend and my mother help me a lot when I'm worried! 

The thing that helped me was that my boyfriend was calm, he was next to me and asking me some questions ( to distract my panic thoughts), then he said ‚Äú this happened before, you didn‚Äôt go to the hospital, and what happened? U was right, now u can do it again) after this he said to start breathing properly from my nose through the mouth. And for real i was totally fine after 3 min. I know this all is in my head, but you know how scary is and how physical bad you feel. "
"So basically whenever I get very stressed or anxious, I have to pee a lot. like every 45 minutes to an hour (normally I go between 3-5 hours).

I went to the doctor for this and they told me I didn't have diabetes or UTI, and that I was most likely fine. I asked if it could be anxiety, and they told me that anxiety only tightens the muscles and doesnt actually make you produce more urine.

I'm convinced anxiety does however, because every time I get anxious, I have to go. Does anyone else have this issue?"
"My HR has been between 100-140 all day even while sleeping I was averaging 60-110. I was just at 142 just sitting here in the couch watching a show. I can't be alone with this kind of HR. I've visited the doctor and had my heart checked and all was well. Last time I had a panic attack and was at 170-200bpm the Doctor said put the fork down and it's just anxiety you will be ok. I can't sit for 5 minutes in a 24 hour period without feeling my heart beating through my chest like no other. The only time I'm at my recommended HR for My age is when I'm sleeping, it I'm awake I'm at 100 minium all day and when moving in at 115-140 just slowly walking or going to the bathroom from the living room. Doctor said go to a gym and lose weight but I've tried and my HR is a minium of 130 just walking on a treadmill. I'm so tired of this and think to myself maybe dying wouldn't be so bad after all because I wouldn't have to deal with this."
"I am presently hyper-concentrating on my teeth and gums and feel like there is a mild pain or burning sensation in a particular area. However when I am not paying attention the pain is not really there. Is it purely due to my anxiety?

&amp;#x200B;

Due to my constant panicking I don't even know when it's a genuine health concern and when it's just me overthinking and ruminating. "

"As asked, Noticed I could feel all my emotions again post a random weed puff. Is this a known thing? In a way its doing what medicines fail to do"
"I turned 30 years old in January and I‚Äôm still upset. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how close to half of my life expectancy is already gone. I‚Äôm constantly scared of dying of a heart attack. I‚Äôm on medication, therapy and I‚Äôm employing techniques to help with my panic attacks but it‚Äôs just so tiring. It‚Äôs hard to live life when all you think about is how you‚Äôll be leaving it.

Anyone else feel similarly? Any tips? Just hope it passes with time? Sounds ridiculous but I could use some reassurances that 30 isn‚Äôt old."
"Does anyone have any advice for how to stop waking up at 4 am and immediately jump into catastrophizing? 

Work and finances have been really troubling me lately but it's something I won't be able to fix or break out of for a couple of months. Been waking up early for about a week regardless of what time I go to bed. "
For me: removing the mask and being totally honest with my loved ones about what's going on
"I used to drink a ton socially in my early 20s, then off and on late 20s, but the last few years I barely drink at all (32F). Maybe once a month at most, and usually only a couple of drinks in a session. 

I never noticed it when I drank more heavily, but now it seems SO obvious - whenever I drink, even just two ciders over 3-4 hours, my anxiety the next day is through the roof. I wake up feeling like the world is ending, like every part of my life is going to fall apart someone and I‚Äôll be miserable forever.  It‚Äôs always worse first thing in the morning, but it lingers for days, even up to a week. 

This is genuinely making me never want to drink alcohol again.  The slightly relaxed feeling I get from two drinks in the sun with a friend, is absolutely not worth the debilitating anxiety that hijacks me for days after. 

Anyone else?"
I have a stressful job or it seems stressful because of my anxiety. When I get up in the morning I feel extremely anxious as I have to go to office. It is probably for high morning cortisol. Is there any thing that I can do to tackle morning anxiety?
I quit my job that I hated and got a new job that‚Äôs part hybrid!!!! It was so hard to quit I‚Äôve been an anxious mess for the past week over it. My boss cried and my coworker was chill about it. Man am I glad it‚Äôs over. Now for the new anxiety: starting a new job :)))))) wish me luck!!! 
"I swear every little ache no matter how tiny it is, my mind instantly go to cancer. 

Although it‚Äôs probably given that I‚Äôve had 4 people I know die of it in the last 12 months, one of them being my mother. 2 were in their early to late 50‚Äôs, one was 61, the other was late 30‚Äôs. I‚Äôm 31. Male.

Every little discomfort I think ‚Äúoh no is this early warnings of cancer?‚Äù

 I recently had some lower pain going down to my calves too and my doctor didn‚Äôt think too much about it. Another nurse practitioner thinks that it‚Äôs probably pinched nerve although sciatica pain is possible.

My mind is ‚Äúoh no is it bone cancer in the spine‚Äù and so forth. I know one of the signs of health anxiety is not even believing your doctor, especially when it‚Äôs TWO health care professionals who are not concerned.

But then I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwell people get misdiagnosed all the time so what if they misdiagnosed me??‚Äù
"
For me its like someone punches me in the stomach and knocked the wind out of me + the same emptiness in your stomach when you're hungry + violent shaking + muscle spasms + rapidly beating heart (sometimes sweating if im feeling fancy)
"Ever since starting the medication again has changed my life entirely. I'm so much happier even though I was happy before stating on a medicatuon again. The medication I'm on is for anxiety,weight loss and for people that want to quit smoking. And I can tell you that the medication has done it's job not only for anxiety but for weight loss. If you have tried several ways to get over anxiety I highly recommend getting on medication if you think it will help you. If you think medication won't help you then that's fine. Do what ever helps you with your anxiety. I needed medication because I'm Autistic I have Asperger's Syndrome and I heard Autistc people are low on the feel good chemical serotonin. And anti anxiety medication gives that to you. I feel so much better being on anti anxiety medication. Does anyone else feel the same way?"
"I've been fighting my anxiety for years and most days I feel like I'm kicking its ass and staying on top. But a week ago I went on a hike in Malibu with my friends and I had a blast but I still had anxiety in my chest and thought to myself, ""I can't even enjoy this awesome beautiful day without suffering"".

And there are days where I'm coping and feel like I'm winning and some days are plain scary.

Does anyone else feel this type of way? Thinking that your anxiety will win someday? 

Thanks for your time"

I've been misdiagnosed and even took hydrazine to attempt to help and it failed. It is a weird hyper specific problem and I don't even know if medication exists for it.

"Does anyone else experience anxiety symptoms even when you're not actively thinking about it?

Has anyone found ways to cope with these unexpected physical symptoms? How do you manage when your body feels like it‚Äôs betraying you, even when you're trying to relax?

"First of all, I'm a non smoker, mon drinker. I exercise 30 to 50 minutes a day. I'm 20 year old female with no major health problems confirmed by doctors aside from absence seizures. Never had my weight come up as a major cause for concern. 

This is all fine and dandy, but the thing is I'm 5'8 and 200 ibs, so despite everything else checking out this always leaves me with a ""but I have one risk factor...so I'm going to drop dead"" mindset. 

People's cruelty and almost gleefully jumping to say that fat people will drop dead of a heart attack in their 30s isn't helping me at all. This doesn't feel like ""I care about your health"" so much as malicious fear mongering. It never came off as concerned, just hateful- and honestly weight and premature death is way more complicated than what people like to preach. (See; some doctors not giving fat people proper medical care. Fat people being scared to go to a doctor because of this. Will contribute to higher risks.)

I'm tired of assholes going on and on about how people like me are going to have a premature death. Yes, you scare people, but we're suddenly skinny because of this..and sometimes it's better and more healthy not to go on sudden diets at all. (Diet is really dependent on the person, not what some random redditor or article has to say. I'd honestly go to a dietitian and doctor to see what works best for you. Like, some people can't have much sodium if they have chronically high bp, if you have something like POTS, sodium and water is good for you to raise blood density, etc. You get my point.)



Honestly, my weight never bothered me and I've been in this range for awhile, I feel the best mentally and physically when I just...eat when I feel like I need to. I've never felt hindered. I just listen to my body. If I want a veggie then I eat one, if I want sugar then I have a fruit. If I don't want something then I don't have it. 


When I was first hit hard with a hyperarousal state for a few months, I shedded weight like crazy- it made me feel like I waa dying! And instead of people being concerned, I got compliments and praise. It really confirmed to me that people just care about my looks more than my health..

I felt wayy better when I began to eat normally again. Regaining pounds made me feel happier if anything. 

but there's always a thought in the back of my head of ""yeah, you feel okay? Well, you'll get an early heart attack one day."" 


Anyone else in my same position? Or share the same sentiment? And no, I'm not looking for diet advice or weight management tips, thanks very much.

"I‚Äôve been dealing with anxiety for a while, and one of the most effective strategies I‚Äôve found is writing in a journal. It took some time for me to realize, but the opposite of anxiety is clarity. By analyzing, breaking down, and facing my worries head-on, I‚Äôve been able to manage my anxiety better. Writing everything down and having a dialogue with myself in my journal has been incredibly therapeutic.

I've also discovered shared journaling communities where I can engage in conversations with myself and with others who are going through similar experiences. If you‚Äôre unsure about the kind of life you want to live or what you‚Äôre passionate about, starting a dialogue with yourself might be a good first step.

I believe that, eventually, we will all find the answers we seek.

So, what are your best methods for coping with anxiety? I‚Äôd love to hear what works for you!"

"He gave me his nightlight and told me I was shaking like a washing machine, he then asked if I was ok before he hugged my knee.

Ive ""hid"" my panic attacks from him as they can look a bit scary for a 4 year old but I got hit with a panic attack while I was sleeping and I started to uncontrollably shake so it woke him up.
He is such a sweet heart hugging my knee,stroking my arm and singing. It is not his ""job"" to take care of me and I told him that but he wanted to make sure mama was ok , I was afraid my panic attack would scare him but he is totaly fine. It worked out."
"I just want to vent because I‚Äôm so pissed off. 

I‚Äôve been suffering with an array of symptoms for several months now which everyone close to me says it‚Äôs anxiety. I‚Äôve talked to a therapist and a mental health nurse who BOTH said they‚Äôve never heard of someone having my symptoms (which I experience 24/7) that was just solely anxiety but apparently no one wants to believe that, my family say ‚Äòthey don‚Äôt know you like we do, trust us it‚Äôs anxiety‚Äô 

Fuck no I don‚Äôt trust you. In 2020, they said some symptoms I was having was anxiety and guess what, it was Crohn‚Äôs disease and I nearly bloody died from it was so bad. 

For context my symptoms are lightheadedness, I feel like I‚Äôm going to pass out 24/7 and I feel like I‚Äôm in a dream. My vision doesn‚Äôt seem right. Things move slower than they are if that makes sense, nothing looks right. My neck is severely tight, my jaw kills and my upper back kills. I have this weird feeling in my chest that I can‚Äôt explain, it‚Äôs just a cold strange feeling that is really uncomfortable. I feel like I‚Äôm dying and I experience this 24/7. Sometimes I can bear it but recently I just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve done everything for anxiety, anti depressants, im doing talking therapies, I did start going out a bit more but I‚Äôve not felt good at all recently so I‚Äôve been home bound. 

What am I meant to do?

Everything is in the title. Personally I've got somes clues (therapy helps) but I don't really know the ""real"" reason.

"Hi everyone. I \[30F\] have been struggling with an especially severe bout of anxiety recently, such to the point that I haven't been eating or sleeping well. I literally have panic attacks when I wake up in the morning, and I'm essentially non-functional at work.

So, being that this is what you're ""supposed"" to do, I made an urgent appointment with my psychiatrist. My symptoms, including passive SI, were/are so bad that I thought I was gonna get committed.

Because I have addiction issues (alcohol and opiates) from back in 2016 that I stupidly admitted to, they absolutely refuse to give me benzos, even though those are the only PRNs that work for me!

I've tried EVERYTHING else imaginable: Hydroxizine, gabapentin, propanolol, Buspirone... the only thing that's worked before was Klonopin, and they absolutely won't prescribe it to me. It's getting so bad that I'm thinking about getting back on Oxy.

You know what my psychatrist did? Up my Lexapro dosage and tell me to see my therapist more. I left the office literally crying because there's no prospect of relief anymore - I just know I have to suffer through it until it passes naturally.

Can anyone relate?

  
Edit: Also, if there are any OTCs people can think of that might help, please let me know. I'm already taking Valerian and melatonin to sleep."
"After years of horrendous dental experience‚Äôs I developed a fear of the dentist and got such bad anxiety over going that I didn‚Äôt go for 6 or 7 years. 

Today was my second appointment back after my initial consultation and I got a cleaning done that I was so relaxed in I almost fell asleep! And 2 cavities filled that was pretty uncomfortable but only because I have such a small mouth that the bite piece that‚Äôs sized for children won‚Äôt fit in my mouth lol 

At the end of my appointment the dentist said if he didn‚Äôt know better that he would never guess that I have anxiety!!! I feel like a rockstar! I go back next month for another cleaning/ checking my gingivitis and I‚Äôm actually excited to go back. 

I wish I never developed this fear because paying adult money on dental work sucks‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm expecting to pay 10-12k in the next year on my teeth. Cavities, wisdom teeth and braces aren‚Äôt cheap people kick your fears and anxiety in the butt!"

"In other words, the dreaded ""you're not special/unique, everyone experiences anxiety from time to time.‚Äù
  
How do you feel when you hear this, or when someone says this directly to you, whether they have dismissive intent or not? Do you find it at all reassuring? Or does it just make you feel invalidated and frustrated? Why do you think people who cannot relate to someone's circumstances say things like this? Is it because they genuinely think because yes, they most likely do feel nervous/ anxious at times when, for example, facing a new challenge or when the unpredictable happens that they know how it feels? What‚Äôs your general attitude to these types of comments?"
"I never knew that unwavering constant anxiety could be this intense, this bad for this long. I literally don't think I'm going to make it through it. I can't anymore. I really can't do it.

"Im a recovering alcoholic, and I finally got the courage to throw away around 15-20 vodka bottles I just had laying around my room, I threw them out in the public container outside of the apartment building I live in. A random man (in his 60s I would say) came up to me and started cursing at me in the most violent and disgusting way ""to be ashamed of what i'm doing"" and how he has a daughter around my age that ""he would murder"" if she did what I do. He followed me for like 5 minutes? And kept calling me degrading names. I haven't been able to sleep since yesterday and I don't know how to forget what happened.
Edit: He also made the assumption that I do drugs and started mocking me."

"I went to the supermarket today which of course is busier than usual, had a bout of bad anxiety and was struggling to keep it at bay (just breathing, keeping head down, focusing on things I could see). Do you guys have any methods?"
"Hey guys. 23m here. Curious if drinking a beer or 2 would help calm me down a bit? I‚Äôm not a drinker by any stretch, no family history of alcoholism, not worried about becoming an alcoholic in the slightest, fyi. 

Long story short, I‚Äôve been unable to breathe for the past 3 days. Feels like I have to take a deep, full breath for every breath. It‚Äôs not satisfying unless I do, and it‚Äôs still only satisfying about 1/4 of the time. Working on controlling my breathing to break the ‚Äúhabit‚Äù of breathing deeply. Do y‚Äôall think if I had a beer or 2 it would help calm me to a point where I can breathe a little more normally? Thanks.

Edit: I will not be drinking any beer. Apparently it‚Äôll help a lot in the beginning but tomorrow it‚Äôll probably be way worse. Really not super anxious, but I can‚Äôt breathe as a result of being anxious and it‚Äôs kind of made itself a habit. Trying to control my breathing and may do some cardio. Thanks guys!

Edit 2: I feel the need to return here and clarify a bit. I‚Äôm not anxious currently, I‚Äôm not an anxious person, I don‚Äôt feel the need to be treated for anxiety. I‚Äôm suffering from Pseudo-Dyspnea, or ‚ÄúAir Hunger‚Äù. For the past 4 days now, I haven‚Äôt been able to breathe properly. All it was for me, was a physically anxious response that hasn‚Äôt went away. I haven‚Äôt had any mental anxiety aside from what the uncomfortable breathing has caused. All I want is to be able to breathe, otherwise I am near perfectly calm and fine. Does this change any answers? I don‚Äôt wanna mess myself up, but at the same time I‚Äôm not masking any internal feelings of anxiety. 

Would it be a better route to ask my grandmother for a low-dose of Xanax? Do y‚Äôall still think beer is *such* a bad idea in this case? I just wanna fucking breathe lol. "
"My older sister has dealt with health anxiety and OCD (I think that the two are linked) since as long as I can remember. She used to confide in me about it but now she pushes me and our family away and has become resentful towards us. 

She screamed at our stepdad last night and told him that she hopes he kills himself from the guilt after she dies because he didn‚Äôt believe that she has a terminal illness and that we will all have blood on our hands when she dies. 

She becomes a different person when she thinks that she‚Äôs dying. She thought that she had kidney failure last week and the results came back that she‚Äôs fine but she is still convinced there‚Äôs something wrong. 

She had a keratin treatment (chemical hair straightening) done a couple months ago and is convinced that it is given her cancer because the hairdresser got some of the solution on her skin.
When she got home she started shouting at our mum and stepdad and broke down in tears. 

She cut off all of her hair a couple days ago and every time she leaves her room it‚Äôs to pick a fight with someone. My stepdad told me that he doesn‚Äôt know how to talk to her anymore because it‚Äôs him that she targets the most. 

She‚Äôs 19 but has spent her entire teenage years hiding away in her room and obsessing over her health. 

I don‚Äôt know how to help her. Once she has it in her head that something is wrong she becomes impossible to reason with. I want to help because it‚Äôs causing so much tension within the house.

"Sorry for what feels like a very basic Anxiety 101 post lol, but I've been struggling lately with feeling really stressed about upcoming events that I can't avoid. I'm alright at minimizing/handling the anxiety in my day to day life, but I have a couple things coming up over the weekend that I'm anxious about and I feel like I can't be totally functional until they're over. In the past when I had the external structure of school or working in-person I felt like I could compartmentalize a bit more, but now I work from home which makes it harder to be distracted. I know I can take a walk, watch a show, etc. but being anxious makes doing things harder and takes away from the enjoyment.

The worst part is sometimes this happens even when the upcoming event is something that should be fun, like a concert or visiting friends or family.

"My Daughter has been diagnosed with anxiety. Recently we have been eating out a lot as we are on holiday. She struggles to choose anything to eat whenever we do this. We have tried where possible to show her the menu in advance, we have also pointed out things that she would like. I have also given her the choice of places to eat whithin reason as I won't be eating at KFC/ subway the entire holiday. 

I have also been encouraging her to order her own food as she struggles to talk to strangers and this is a basic skill we all need.

I don't think that I am asking too much of a 12 year old but the whole process is becoming so frustrating that myself and my wife don't want to eat out with her at the moment.

"Hi I am curious about people's subjective experience of panic. 

How does it make you feel?

How do you feel inside?

How does your experience of the world feel?

Thank you for your time."
"I really like coffee and I have been drinking it for years since I was probably around 12 and would always have it with sugar.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I started a new job where I don't have time to get as much coffee as I used to. I still have the cup for breakfast and one when I get home with dinner. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately though, I've noticed that during the work day, my anxiety and general nervousness has gone down a good bit.

"I used to be a very social person. I struggled with anxiety some, but never like this. With the pandemic keeping people locked down a lot, then working from home, and then a medical bout that kept me inside a lot (broke my pelvis and had to have a hip replacement at a relatively young age), I've been spending a lot of time at home alone. 

On top of this, between August-September I either had a gallstone or gastritis and was, let's just say... in need of a convenient bathroom at all times. 

Recently I've been getting physical signs of anxiety every time it's about time to go somewhere, even in my comfort zone, like going out with close friends or even just driving up to the grocery store. Right now I have cottonmouth and my stomach is in knots all because I plan on driving no more than 10 minutes away to go play Pok√©mon Go in the park.

I'm not sure where this is coming from, but it's like I have agoraphobia all of a sudden. Any tips? "
"For me, personally, the 2017 DuckTales reboot is what helped me around the time when my anxiety got bad enough to warrant a diagnosis, and now it‚Äôs helping me get through the first weeks of sertraline. "
I am in the hospital right now with a panic attack I don't know what it is I just feel loss of reality I feel like something bad is going to happen my brain is funking out real bad I feel doom I feel everything loss of mind like something bad is going to happen in my head I keep walking outside and pacing around 
"Anyone know what that's called? I'm in a phase where I'm anxious/negative/worried about something most of the time, but sometimes even if I'm not actively thinking about one of those things I get this feeling like something is not right. I'm not downright depressed but just feel uneasy in my existence. Ugh. Being human sucks sometimes lol

Also, anyone who experiences this find anything that helps?"
"My anxiety has been horrible for months now, despite my psychiatrist‚Äôs best efforts to solve it with medication. Even fucking Xanax didn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm in therapy. I‚Äôm just not getting better and I think I‚Äôm having a mental breakdown. I‚Äôm going through so much in personal life (stressful job, separation from a verbally abusive husband, a child with a disability, loss of my support system) and I feel like I‚Äôm breaking. 


Last night I was falling asleep around 2AM (full disclaimer: I took a high dose marijuana gummy much earlier in the evening last night. I was not high at all high at this time). And all of a sudden, my left eye starting hurting. It felt like I was being stabbed in the eye. My face felt numb and I felt my heart rate drop. I started shaking and felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe or swallow. My vision got blurry. I‚Äôve had hundreds of panic attacks in my life and this did not feel like a panic attack. I felt like I was legitimately dying. I woke up my husband and told him what was happening and he didn‚Äôt seem concerned (typical but anyways). I suddenly felt like I was going to pee my pants and I rushed into the bathroom. I didn‚Äôt need to pee and i felt confused but I just had to so bad. For some reason, I just called an ambulance immediately. I couldn‚Äôt even tell the dispatcher what was happening because I wasn‚Äôt making sense at first. She seemed really concerned but when I told her I took an edible much earlier that evening, all the concern went away. She said she was sending an ambulance to make sure I‚Äôm okay and I asked her not too. She said since I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe she had to. 


Okay. Fine. The humiliation starts to come and I start freaking out again. The ambulance gets here in trying to tell them what was happening and the paramedic seemed dismissive. They took me into the ambulance and acted like I was an idiot. I was sobbing and telling them I was sorry and I know it‚Äôs not the edible, it‚Äôs just a really bad panic attack. He took my vitals and said ‚Äúim not really impressed by a 32 year old having high blood pressure at 2AM. you need to cut back on the gummies‚Äù I told him my blood pressure is usually low and that‚Äôs kinda unusual? I asked if the gummies weren‚Äôt a factor, would things be taken more seriously? He just kind of scoffed and said that gummies are bad for me and I need to stop. 


I know edibles are an issue and I‚Äôm not denying that. But I wasn‚Äôt high when this happened. I hadn‚Äôt felt high in hours and I‚Äôve never had a panic attack while high. The weed helps me sleep most nights so this was just‚Ä¶ scary. I was humiliated because I thought I was dying and instead I‚Äôm being lectured about marijuana usage. And I know he was probably annoyed but like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not having fun either! I just thought I was having a stroke 10 minutes ago! 


I eventually went to sleep and woke up and just started sobbing. I‚Äôm humiliated from last night. I have so much on my plate. I‚Äôm failing at life. I can‚Äôt shower lately or eat or keep my house clean. I‚Äôm exhausted. I don‚Äôt sleep well. I keep making mistakes at work. My fuse is so short and my thoughts are always racing. I feel like I‚Äôm going to fucking explode at any given moment. 


I did call a crisis support center a little after I woke up and explained everything that happened. I‚Äôve never done this before but I feel like‚Ä¶ something is wrong with me. I‚Äôm exhausted by my own brain. The crisis center person told me I should go to a walk in clinic to talk to someone. But after the whole weed gummy thing, I feel like‚Ä¶ all this is my fault? I don‚Äôt want to be dismissed again because I use marijuana but it‚Äôs really the only thing that helps me sleep. Prescription medications couldn‚Äôt even do that. I feel like a disgusting loser pot head now that won‚Äôt be taken seriously by mental health professionals. "
"I was just diagnosed with atrial tachycardia, a type of SVT. Every few months my heart skips a bunch then goes really fast (170 bpm last week). I feel so scared and bummed out now that I ""officially"" have a heart arrhythmia. All the years of holters and ekgs, ER visits, being told its ""just"" anxiety. I insisted on a loop recorder (holter that stays in your chest) and they finally got it after years of dreading it. And wouldnt you know, its not ""just anxiety"". Ive never been so mad being right. Sure its ""not fatal"", but not 100%.and with someone with health anxiety with agoraphobia and panic disorder, it's not comforting at all."
Just curious on everyone‚Äôs strategies. For me it‚Äôs listening to sleep meditation/hypnosis videos. Having a voice to focus on helps a lot. 
"okay so ik this isn‚Äôt the usual type of thing on here, but‚Ä¶ i was wondering if anyone in this subreddit has watched inside out 2 and if you have how do you feel Anxiety was portrayed? also if you haven‚Äôt SPOILERS ahead!!



for me when i watched the movie, i feel even though riley is a 13 year old girl i could relate to her as a 20 yr old woman. when she had that anxiety attack and Anxiety looked like she was frozen but really she was moving around so fast, it broke my heart and made me cry because i felt seen. for some they don‚Äôt understand what an anxiety attack looks or feels like, and that‚Äôs understandable because it can look and feel different from person to person. but when joy was finally able to step in and help Anxiety it was so bittersweet. Anxiety really tried to do what she thought best for riley. when riley was having her attack with her struggle to breath, fast heart rate, maybe chest pressure i feel like those are the things along with others that i feel when i have an anxiety attack and it‚Äôs hard to overcome them at times and they can last varying periods of times or hit us at the most inconvenient of times. 

i really think this is a movie that teenagers and adults can relate to! this movie also made me look at my emotions differently and realize that no one single emotion has to control/define me. i really like the ending where her belief system is remade into a combination of all her emotions and it really shows how complex our minds are and how that affects our actions. 

please at least someone respond to this because this is a discussion i would love to see people‚Äôs opinions on!!"
"I don't really know how to function right now. I've had him since he was a puppy and nearly half my life (he just turned 15).

Not really sure what the point of posting this is."

"I am 29 male, I lost my mother due to cancer when I was 26. At the beginning I was feeling normal nothing crazy and went back to work right away. I quite my job to finish my degree and all the grief smacked me at once when I was home alone, I suddenly started to have anxiety, I went to the emergency room multiple times thinking that I might get a heart attack and they always tell me I am fine. I went to therapy, it did help but I stopped because every session became repetitive and I felt that I am not learning anything. The fear of death or thinking about death doesn‚Äôt leave my mind, I started to question life and what is the purpose of life. I am always afraid that I might lose loved ones, I always creep on my wife or dad at the middle of the night to make sure they are breathing. I used to be an athletic dude and I become fat with low energy. I would like some advice if someone went through what I went through.

"Before i‚Äòm getting started I just want to say that this post is just me ranting and venting about my current life situation, maybe it makes me feel better to write it out, alright;


I‚Äôm 22 and wasted so many years due to my anxiety. Even as a kindergarten kid I felt anxious, I couldn‚Äôt handle large groups of kids there and often felt overwhelmed. In first and second grade I used to throw up every day in the school bus or before going out, it got better after second grade tho. Throughout school I was kinda alright, I had some friends and it was fun most times, I still was very shy but I had good grades and stuff. 
After graduation my anxious mind came back; worse than before. I couldn‚Äôt go outside, I felt sick all the time. I went to therapy then, I‚Äôm not sure if it really helped me, but I was able to do ‚Äûnormal‚Äú things after some months. 
Now, in my early 20s, I feel anxious again, it got a little bit bad again; going to stores, big cities, crowds etc. make me nervous and sometimes even give me anxiety attacks. I‚Äôm trying to force myself to go to these places, I know that it‚Äôs the only way to make it better, but it‚Äôs tough sometimes. 

And all this stuff makes me so mad. I hate how i‚Äòm partly trapped in my own god damn mind. I want to live and meet people, I don‚Äôt want to waste my time anymore. I‚Äôll only live once (i‚Äòm not religious), so why am I prisoning myself? "
"Turning 26 this year. Growing up my parents made what they could but it wasn‚Äôt always very nutritious. Think sloppy joes or chicken alfredo.

I‚Äôm just having anxiety over what future problems my body may have because I didn‚Äôt nurture it properly during development 

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments, I really do feel better! Both from the lifestyle changes and your feedback! "
"I don't know if this is the right place for this or not; please let me know and I will remove it, or I won't be offended if it is removed and someone points me in the right direction.

Quick-quick overview: Female, married, grown children (moved out), mid-fifties, job, had anxiety at some level my entire life.

I work in an office in a one-story building, which is about 9,000 square feet US. We have a head boss, an assistant boss, me (Administrative Assistant to the head boss), a custodian, and a handful of other employees who drift in and out. Not a big operation, but we specialize. Head Boss (HB), Assistant Boss (AB) and me work in an office area about 1,500 square feet. We each have our own office, and there is a separate conference room/break room with a microwave, coffee grinder and coffee pot, mini-fridge, and conference table. I usually eat my lunch at my desk, by personal preference. I also usually work through lunch, also by personal preference.

I have several food allergies and intolerances, so it is very difficult for me to just grab lunch at a restaurant. On days I work, I also tend to make lunch my meal of the day, and have just a light supper (or skip it altogether). Therefore, I normally make my lunch and bring it in. It is usually something I can heat up in the microwave; a gluten free chicken pot pie, a bowl of vegetable soup, a bowl of gluten-free spaghetti, a package of pre-made gluten free chicken fettuccini alfredo. In the summer I often do gluten free sandwiches or salad with a piece of chicken breast that I've heated up in the microwave. So far, none of this has been a problem...or so I thought.

I spent a good part of today out of the office, at another part of our campus. I'd heated up a little cup of microwave oatmeal [(this oatmeal cup)](https://www.bobsredmill.com/shop/oats/gluten-free-brown-sugar-and-maple-oatmeal-cup.html) and was able to scarf that down before I had a meeting and then had to leave at about 11 AM, but I worked through lunch. I didn't get back to the office until about 3:45 and I'd not only had no lunch but no coffee. I'd brought a bowl of homemade Vegetable Beef Soup and gluten free crackers for lunch, and some chocolate pudding cups to keep in my desk for desserts. That bowl of soup sounded like the absolute tastiest thing in the world right then because I was **STARVING**.

I knew that HB was going to be having a group meeting in the conference room with AB and the other floater employees at 4:30. I just wanted to make my coffee, heat up my soup, and hide in my office. I mentioned how hungry I was to HB. He said, and this is pretty much a quote, ""Could you heat up your food in \[custodian's\] microwave? Your food has a very definite strong smell. It lingers.""

The custodian's area is all the way on the other side of the building from us. I really didn't want to carry a bowl of hot soup from one side of the building to the other. Plus, I was all of a sudden just hit with...the smell lingers? It *lingers?* Does it smell *bad?* Is it a *terrible* smell? Does it smell *gross?* Has it been smelling gross and lingering *the entire four years I've worked here and nobody has told me??? WHAT DOES HE MEAN, THE SMELL LINGERS??? OMG, I'M GROSSING OUT MY BOSS!!!*

I just stood there. I didn't know what to do. I finally just stuttered something like, ""Uh, okay, sorry,"" and went into my office and tried not to cry. (Failed, but at least it was quiet.) I already had my coffee, but I was still hungry. I finally just ate a pudding cup and some of the crackers that I brought to eat with my soup. I was so looking forward to that soup; I made it myself and it is good soup, but now I don't even care about it.

I understand that HB didn't want food odors hanging around while he was trying to have his meeting. They do close the door of the conference room and whatever smells are in there are just trapped there. I get it. And HB really isn't a jerk, even though I may have painted him as one; he's actually a very nice guy who gave me a chance at a job when nobody else would. I'm very grateful to him and I like him very much. He's just one of those people who are very blunt, and he doesn't think about how he could say something nicely or if what he is saying could be misconstrued. It literally doesn't occur to him that someone could take offense to things he says, because to him he is just saying a true fact. I'm sure he just meant that he didn't want a food odor cloud hanging out with them in their meeting.

But...it just hit me like a brick, and I have been so upset ever since. Everyone has now left the office and I'm still here, crying because I'm afraid my food has been stinking up the place and nobody told me, and now I'm afraid to even bring in anything to eat that needs to be heated up. Like I said, I can't just go to McDonald's or Arby's or wherever and grab food that's already cooked for me.

In fact, I've gotten myself so worked up that I feel myself getting sleepy, which always happens when I am overstimulated emotionally (I think I'm somewhat narcoleptic). The doctor gave me Buspirone 5 mg to take when I feel overwhelmed, but it doesn't seem to be doing much. And I feel nauseous, which is probably the coffee on an empty stomach. I need to eat lunch at work tomorrow. I don't know if I can do it!"
"I have pretty bad anxiety that I have learned how to manage for the most part, but every two months or so, for a week I wake up in state of sheer panic, truly feeling like I am going to lose my mind and need to go to the hospital. By around noon I am exhausted but far less anxious and by the evening I feel like I'll never be anxious again.

Why does this keep happening when I don't feel anxious or upset the night before. It's truly baffling to me and I don't know how to solve it but it is making going to work hellish when I feel so scared."
"I have a huge irrational fear of being wrongfully imprisoned. It‚Äôs literally all I can think about and it‚Äôs stressing me out. I feel like feds are going to break into my house and get me any minute. Even typing this is making me anxious.


Edit: I‚Äôm going to try to respond to comments later but it‚Äôs helping me so much that you guys can relate. It really helps me rationalize as I don‚Äôt have a therapist yet. I appreciate all the comments so much. I‚Äôm sorry you guys are going through similar things but we‚Äôll be okay, and there‚Äôs always a community here for support :). "
"So for me right now I have upper left arm pain along with the centre of chest pain‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like so annoying why can‚Äôt it be leg pain or something instead? I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else gets left arm pain?

"Hypochondria is scary. For as long as I can remember I‚Äôve always thought I had some life threatening illness. I don‚Äôt get why our brains convince us that we‚Äôre dying (even though you yourself know you‚Äôre not). For the last 2 months I though I had kidney disease and finally got tested and turns out my kidneys are in perfect condition. Before that it was cancer, stds, live disease, you name it I thought I had it. Fortunately I‚Äôve never had any of the following.  I think the one upside to having this condition though is that I‚Äôm more self aware and thankful for my health. I feel like a lot of people take it for granted. When you convince your self your dying and then realize you‚Äôre not it really humbles you. Anyone else have any input they‚Äôd like to add??"
"I‚Äôve had anxiety all of my life and I‚Äôve drank caffeine since I was a kid. I used to be able to drink big monster energy drinks, shots of espresso, soda, 4 cups of coffee a day, etc. But one day my body suddenly couldn‚Äôt tolerate a drop of it. Did this happen to anybody else?"
"Every day I wake up at 4-5 in the morning with my heart pounding feeling anxious. I've given up on trying to get back to sleep- the more I stress about it, the more it makes me feel worse, and the less likely I will be able to actually fall asleep again. What's in your tool kit for dealing with anxiety so early in your day? I have found that meditation and podcasts help me. Any suggestions for either of the two? Anything else I can do that's not using a phone?"
How do you help yourself bring it 'down' to a calmer level? Do you have some words to live by or just.. generally how do you calm your mind? Gah. Terrible wording I apologize.
"I started my new teaching job about 5 weeks ago and I‚Äôm already having to take a day off because my panic attacks are so bad.

"I developed constant anxiety about 4 ish weeks ago after having a panic attack that felt like a heart attack. It comes and goes but it feels like theres no escape, anything that sets off a small amount of anxiety will spiral into being worried about the anxiety symptoms and feeling like a life threatening illness.

It keeps evolving too, every panic attack feels the same but completely different, this time i didnt have chest pain but felt super faint and dizzy like i was about to drop dead. The only way i can tell the difference is if im able to calm myself down or distract myself and the symptoms get better, because im guessing a life threatening illness wont just come and go depending on my mood lol.

Its ruining my life, my sleep is terrible, im constantly out of energy, i can barely focus on anything (not that i could anyway tbh). I cant make any long term progress in my life when im barely able to live day by day"

"I feel like i am so anxious about if im healthy or not and if my hormones are allright, i cant even eat a meal without being anxious about having the right nutrients. Am i eating too much? Am i eating too little? Do i have all the right vitamines? Do i have too much of certain vitamines? Like i worry if my hair will fallout if i eat too little protein or maybe too much.

I hate it so so much, like i dont want to always focus on my food, and when i try to be relaxed about it or not think about it, i think im gonna be really unhealthy.

Im trying to stay off tiktok rn because its really messed up my way of thinking.

For example im trying to be more fit and lose a bit of weight (not a crazy amount or something), but then i see tiktoks about DONT DRINK COFFEE in the morning cus itll raise cortisol and youll keep fat in your midsection or ruin your hormones. Cus i know hormones play  a big part aswell in mood regulation etc. But i just get so scared that if i do something wrong ill mess everything up."
"What is ONE song you listen to that helps your anxiety? For mine it is ""Reborn"" By I See Ghosts."
"One of my (23M) friends (24M) I've known for a few years texted me this morning saying he slept with the person he went out on a date with last night and the moment I read the message I started having an anxiety attack. I've taken my prescription medication for anxiety to help deal with it but it's still happening and it's really bothering me for some reason. 

I don't have feelings for this friend, and even if I did nothing could ever come of it cause he's straight. And it's not like I feel heartbroken or anything, it's just pure anxiety. As if he told me he had gotten injured and is in the hospital not as if he had gotten laid. 

The weird thing is I'm happy he's getting out of his shell more and going on dates and sleeping with people, but this still bothers me on some subconscious level clearly otherwise I wouldn't be having anxiety over it. I just don't know why. Anyone have any ideas?"
"Huge much needed W in my life right now.  Using tools I‚Äôve learned in therapy such as box breathing and CBT, I was able to avoid a full on panic attack.  I did cheat and use my pulse oximeter to assure myself I wasn‚Äôt having a heart attack, but I‚Äôm still calling it a win.  Also I‚Äôve been using it less and less to reassure myself."
"I‚Äôm looking for career options that doesn‚Äôt conflict too much with my anxiety, but it‚Äôs difficult finding something that pays decent, but doesn‚Äôt make me want to run for the hills. I currently have a wfh data entry job but the pay isn‚Äôt great. I love it a lot though because my interaction with people is very minimal and my work life balance is awesome."
I'm 23f and I've been struggling with anxiety for a while now. It has gotten pretty bad lately. Like really bad and it's getting out of control. It has gotten to the point where I'm getting anxiety attacks almost everyday now. I'm also a chronic worrier and I can't stop catastrophizing. Like I can't stop worrying about the future and thinking that the worst is going to happen. My mind is always so busy and I don't know how to make it stop. I'll do anything to make it stop at this point. It's really taking a toll on my both mentally and physically. I'm trying my best but I don't know how to cope with this anymore. I just want it to stop.
