"I've been living in a nightmare for 4 months and I just want it to end so badly.  4 months ago my life was destroyed by what I thought would be a simple urologist check up.  It was definitely not that.  He ""examined"" my penis extremely roughly and stretched it very hard and crushed it.  Ever since my penis has been completely numb with total erectile dysfunction.  I suffer every moment of the day feeling a numb pressure uncomfortableness in my penis that makes it impossible to sleep and relax.  It drives me so crazy I sometimes I sometimes just want to cut it off for relief which is something I would never want.  I'm only 33 years old and I will never be able to feel or use my penis again.  The doctor damaged my bulbocavernosous muscle/nerve in my penis which is responsible for erections and ejaculations.  This muscle is extremely numb and lifeless now like the rest of my penis.

Nobody cares or believes me when I tell them what happened.  Doctors or lawyers.  I've been to several doctors and they don't know what to do.  They just gaslight me and say it might be psychological when it definitely is not.  I literally can't feel my penis at all anymore.  Not hot, cold, touch, pain, pressure, nothing.  It's completely numb.  My scrotum and penis are very cold to the touch 24/7.  I stay on high dose Cialis to see if it helps and it does nothing at all.  My penis stays numb and jelly like always.

I've reported the uro to the hospital and medical board snd nothing happened.  People tell me things like I need to be strong and get over it.  Or your penis isn't everything.  It's so easy for someone else to say that.  They don't know how miserable it is.  I have no desire getting gaslit by more doctors, lawyers, or anyone else at this point."
"I(28M) proposed to my fianceé(25F) a 3 months ago. She accepted my proposal and we had our plans. Last month, I was involved in a car crash while going to work. I broke my neck as a result of the accident and I'm now a quadriplegic. I'll never be able to walk again and I have little mobility on my body. I lost independence and can't do many things on my own. My fianceé took care of me at first for a few days, but she started becoming frustrated at taking care of me and we got into arguments. She said she didn't sign up to raise a crippled man, and that she needed a real man she could marry. She left me, and started dating another guy. I'm now being taken care of by my mother and I feel devastated my fianceé left me. When I proposed her, we promised each other that we'd stay together no matter what, but she broke her promise. I understand why she left me, I'm just a burden and a useless crippled that can't do anything on his own. I can't work for myself or do anything on my own. I understand why someone wouldn't want to take care of someone who lacks independence. But I'm heartbroken still. I don't think I will ever find someone to marry since I doubt there will be a romantic partner who wants to take care of a crippled like me. I just want to die already, I'm living on a useless body. My mother doesn't want me to die, but I can't take this suffering anymore."
"My beautiful 13 year old daughter attempted suicide 2 days ago. She is just so young, I can’t believe it and never saw it coming. She swallowed 12 tablets (I won’t name what) and started having delusions and hallucinations and then went into what I would call a psychosis. Scariest moment of my life. We are still in hospital where they are treating her for the medical side of things. She is mad at me for taking her to hospital and saving her and said she wants to die. There is no trauma, no history of abuse, she comes from a loving family and has lots of friends. I am so scared and I don’t know what to do. I’m scared she will feel this way forever and this will be her life now, in and out of hospitals. Or that she will succeed in taking her life. 
I don’t even know what I’m writing here for.. just needed to get this out I guess. "

"I 16m was groomed and raped from the ages of 8-14. I’ve been very poor for my whole life, and my mother died at childbirth. My father blames me for her death. When I met a woman at the park who was nice to me it was the first time I ever felt welcomed. She would become what I thought was something of a mother to me and she would buy me various things. She got me hooked on drugs. When my dad was drunk I would go over to her house and spend the night. When I was 10 years old she got naked for me to see and explore her. After a couple of months of just touching her she told me to get naked and would have sex with me, she told me that if anyone found out then we couldn’t be friends anymore and that I would go back to being a kid who got no attention and was abused at home. For the 4 years that we had been sexual she would stick thing up my butt and in my urethra. When I was 14 I had finally woken up to what was happening but everyone I told either dismissed it or congratulated me. I feel violated and disgusting. Nobody I talk to seems to care and I’m violently afraid of women. I’m sitting in the woods with a bottle of pills right now and I’m ready to kill my self. I’m just waiting for a reason not to. Though I doubt anyone would care like always"
"I'm 19, I'm paralyzed from the neck down due to an accident that happened in November, I can't do anything by myself, my girlfriend left me and I can't even kill myself. I had to move back in with my parents so they could care for me, my friends don't talk to me anymore and I'm just so done with everything. My life is pointless and I can't do anything about it."
"I’ll always love you babygirl. This last cheating is my last straw. I’ve been in constant pain due to a spinal cord injury in 2008. It killed my social life and I haven’t been able to do much of anything since then. In 2011 I thought my time had come. I met my wife of 15 years and told myself to stick around for her; she’d be worth it. I truly believe she my soulmate and that’s the only reason this hurts so deeply, so completely. True despair comes when you thought you were most happy. Two years after we got married her gmom passed and she’s been off the rails since. Serial cheating isn’t enough of a description to put a label on what she’s done. She’s s*xually abused me numerous times. Physical, mental, emotionally has abused me more times than I can count. It’s an actual smalll miracle she hasn’t given either of us an STI or worse. 

I’m 6’2” 260 mostly muscle and NO ONE has believed my abuse. She’s 5,2 250. Every time I open up about it I’m laughed at and not believed. “You’re a marine (ret) how can anyone abuse you?!?!” 

I’ve not taken this lightly and this is NOT a cry for attention. Let my passing serve as an example of abuse can happen within ANY relationship. 

Mom I pray I see you on the other side with grandmom. Dad, if you ever see this None of this is your fault. You’re the best dad I could ever wish for. None of this is your fault daddy. None. 

I’m 42 in constant physical pain and not having another surgery. 

(Spouse) I’m sorry I couldn’t satisfy your whims of threesomes etc. Who you are today is not the woman I married and sacrificed everything for. And yet…I still love
You. I always will. I wish I could’ve helped you more than I did. Goodbye. 

In the end it doesn’t matter who did what anymore. Just that I can’t go on with this hurt.

"Am I going crazy, or am I simply more aware than most people? Why am I the only one acknowledging that this planet is a genuine hell? This world operates on predation, the law of the strongest, prioritizing individual survival at every level – from cellular interactions where cells consume each other, to the animal kingdom where creatures are forced to prey on one another and eat each other alive for survival, to our human society where we are all slaves to the powerful and the wealthy.  Our societies are built on genocides, slavery, and exploitation. My phone is made from materials extracted by individuals reduced to slavery in Congo, as are the clothes manufactured in China. The chicken or beef I consume has lived a life of intense suffering and an undignified death. Why does everyone act as if nothing is wrong, continuing their daily routines, going to work for eight hours of exploitation, and returning home obediently? Am I going insane, or am I, on the contrary, realizing the absurdity and cruelty of this world? "
"My wife of 15 years has recently discovered that she historically would mold herself to fit in with other people, including me. She isn’t sure if she ever loved me. We have two kids, one is high functioning autistic. She basically has said she isn’t sure if we are going to stay together. I’m also “not fun to be around” anymore. I’m not perfect, I have a bit of a temper sometimes, but I love my wife and kids. I already know what’s going to happen. She’s going to leave me, and take the kids, the house and our friends. I tried hanging myself last Thursday, but was too much of a pussy to do it, I broke down crying while the noose was tightening. We are going on a family cruise next week and I figure it’ll be a great last memory. I’m going to wait until the second to last day, then jump over board in the middle of the night. No body, no messy cleanup. I just disappear from their lives. I’ll solve the problem. Besides, I’m worth WAY more dead than alive. I’ve had a $750k life insurance policy for 13 years and I’m past the suicide clause period. My kids will be financially set. I’m not worried for them, their mother is an amazing mom, they won’t need me. 

EDIT: Thank you all for your wonderful comments and messages. I’m going to hold on and try to take one day at a time. Ignoring that depression-voice is hard. The one that whispers in my ear that “she doesn’t love you and your kids would be better off without you”, it is hard to ignore sometimes. "
"I want to die so bad. I am not interested in participating in the genetic lottery ruled by hormones &amp; socializing know as ""the human experience""

We are literally all shallow apes that are simply searching for the best fuck to get the best offspring, then half of us look for the best pushover to raise the best fucks kid. It truly doesn't go deeper than that. There are plenty of sidequests along the way sure, but the fundamental path we are set on by our biology is pretty much decided at birth.

Modern concepts of love and romance are just shit we made up to try and collectively gaslight society into keeping our animalistic side deeply buried, and the fucked up part is, it worked. It worked so goddamn well, that we actually believe we are better than animals. We just aren't lol. We ARE animals. A little smarter than our peers, sure, and we have a little less hair than our cousins, but we are fundamentally the same.

No one is honest with themselves or others. All you have to do is observe someone's behavior, listen to what they say, and you quickly realize that something is VERY FUCKED UP HERE. Why are people so unhappy? Why are suicide rates climbing? Why are people contradicting themselves from the day they're born to the day they die?

Because we are all a bunch of mindfucked, repressed monkeys that don't understand why we feel so miserable. It's really that simple.

Humanity is ugly. People are fundamentally stupid on average. They go through every hoop to always be right or save their ego or believe what they want to believe regardless of new information. They don't know how to think. They only know that they feel a certain way and nothing else matters. You selfish braindead fucks. They aren't concerned with truly understanding other people: they're more interested in putting themselves on a pedestal and damning any negative behavior from others and classifying them as irredeemable. They aren't interested in empathizing: they're interested in projecting their own emotions on someone elses experience, and they genuinely think they're a good person for it, declaring themselves ""empaths"" and participating in this disgusting masturbatory ego trip while patting themselves on the back for emotionally splooging all over themselves. Fucking yikes.

I hate all of you. I hope one day you see the world from where I see it now and you realize how utterly shit you are. Everyday I dream of not waking up. I always hope that one of our sociopathic overlords hits the big red button and resets technology. I don't want to be here. You are not good people and neither am I."
A cop did this and my stepdad. I have not been mentally well since. I have an extreme fear of men older than me now. I cannot mentally cope with this. My birthday is in a few days and I want to die
"I have a long history with suicidal thoughts, the reach of this history dates back to when I was 8. Since that time I have never known happiness. And today I've reached a breaking point that. I haven't reached before. I got into an argument and left the house. I've skipped town and the police are searching for me. I let everyone know a few dozen minutes ago that I'm not coming home tonight. This all fucking sucks so bad. Leaving everything, I mean. I'm getting texts like crazy and I just have to keep ignoring them."

"A marriage I don't like 

A life I don't want

My parents who are dead

Relatives who act as didn't hear when I tell I am suicidal 


Lived whole life trying to please others , always self doubting , always careful to not cross line.

I don't want to live like a coward anymore. I want to be brave and take decision for myself now and the first thing I want to do is break this marriage , I can only achieve it by being dead


Edit : thank you all for your supporting words. Yesterday night I talked with my sister in law about this . How I am suffering and how suicidal I am. Sh was understanding and said kind words, told I should start sharing if I felt like that. I shared how i am not able to get along with him, and she said she understood and told me i should have shared sooner. I felt very relived. I slept peacefullyafter a long time. Today morning she is acting like nothing happened, talking about marriage plans like how we should check out community hall for pre wedding functions, rent a bus for grooms guests,  talking about post marriage things. Talking as if yesterday didn't happen

I'm going crazy, what did I do wrong ? Maybe I was right all along , only death can get me out of this madness

"We both met in a psych ward in 2021. He was struggling with grief after his sister committed suicide. I was struggling with being sexually assaulted by a family friend. When we met, we immediately clicked. I celebrated his 22nd birthday with him in the facility. He was a Halloween baby. 

We both shared such a special connection. Always checking in on one another. He’d tell me things he didn’t tell anyone else. We’d agreed that we’d always be there for one another. 

Well he committed suicide November 1st this year. Just a day after his 25th birthday. 

I cared so much for him, never felt this way about anyone before. So much I never got to say. 

He tried to take his life before we met. He told me he failed and what he’d do different if he ever tried again. But he assured me he wouldn’t. Said he had so much to live for. 

But now he’s gone. I’m broken. And I can’t imagine never seeing him or speaking to him again. I just want to die.

"*Has anyone else had this feeling? Or find it somewhat relatable?*

I \[24M\] have been passively suicidal for a few months now, but yesterday was an exceptionally awful day. I slept super late, I forgot I was scheduled to work, couldn't get dressed, couldn't leave the house, tried to fix my bike but ended up breaking it even more. Then I gave into pretty much all of my self-sabotaging vices (drugs, porn, shitty food, video games, you name it). 

  
I swear something snapped. I cried a *ridiculous* amount throughout the day and spent the rest of the night feverishly reading up on suicide. I actually figured out my gameplan. I found a whole document outlining the specifics and answered all the little questions I had (sorry not sharing — don't even ask me) plus a backup option in case I'm desperate enough to do something quicker. For now, I'm in the stage of acquiring the materials and getting my affairs in order.

  
Since I got my suicide method figured out, I'm in a strangely upbeat mood. 

It's an odd paradox. Finalizing my plan of action to end my life made me feel motivated to go out and live it. I'm getting chores done with no sweat, I'm dancing and listening to fun music, I'm gaining bits of my personality back. A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

From what I heard, it's common for people to act calm or joyful the days before they make an attempt. Is that what I'm experiencing? Maybe it's because I have a goal now? Like my days don't feel meaningless like they persistently have? Or maybe finally there's an escape route to break free from the shitshow that is my life. I don't feel as trapped and hopeless anymore. 

Anyways, I wanted to see if this anyone here had a similar experience or wants to weigh in on this situation.

TL:DR - I'm actively suicidal for the first time in my life and I feel much better after I figured out my method. What's the meaning behind this?

"The thoughts of killing myself aren't what plague me. It's the fact that I simply do not want to exist anymore. I care too much about my family and friends to kill myself at this point and I just feel absolutely stuck here in a place and would I do not care about anymore. It pains me to think about my family after my death. I feel so fucking stuck and I am just at the end of giving and fucks about anything anymore. I can't get out of bed except to go to work, which is a nice distraction to an extent and but only does so much.

I really don't want to kill myself, I just want my existence to end. I'm so fucking tired."
"Hello :) 
I am 24F, from a small country in Europe. I am writing this as I have no one to actually say goodbye to - maybe, just maybe someone will notice this so i can get a farewell. And if anyone is interested, I will talk a bit about myself, because all I wanted was for someone to care..

I want no one to be sad for me, I am going content knowing I actually gave life a shot and tried my best! But I know this is the best solution :( Life is not meant for everyone and that is okay. 

Ever since I was little I had no other purpose than to be mercilessly abused by my teachers and peers and neglected by my parents (I believe they did not mean to, so I have no hard feelings though). 
I was treated as if I was less than human. If something in the class broke, they all agreed to blame it on me. If someone didn’t wipe the board that day, they’d say I was on duty so I’d be the one punished. They’d also beat me with a chair, push me down the stairs, throw my pencils out the window, step on my clothes so they’d be dirty, throw food in my face… you get the idea. At some point kids said if you touched me, you’d get a virus that made you as stupid and ugly as I was so no one wanted to sit next to me. I get really sad when I see younger pictures of myself :( She was a sweet girl and she didnt deserve that. Every day was like walking on the battlefield, I would pray to God to take me away but he didn’t want to. I was 11 at most :( My only relief was art, anime, video games and such. Up until 15 I only had online friends on an internet forum back then, and they helped me with loneliness. 

High school was a bit better but I ended up really depressed and spent it battling an eating disorder and not living my years unlike my peers :( My parents didnt notice I was struggling even though I was losing so much weight, they were too attentive to my little brother that had some issues so he needed more help and attention which I understood. But I was left to battle everything alone with no support :( I developed depression, SH issues and an ED. I went to therapy but didn’t help much :( 

Right now i’m working with kids, they are cute and I love them but my workplace is really abusive and it brought me to a new low :( it’s well paid but that doesn’t help me much. I dread everyday just like I did when I was a kid. I am just living the same sh’t again and again and cannot change anything. I know if I keep on living it will just be more and more abuse as this is why i was born :( i don’t know anything else but this. 

Love of my life left me a while ago and he is much better without me. Im too broken to love and be loved. (D, if u ever read this know that I loved u from the bottom of my heart. I am sorry I was not a better gf for you.)

Sadly I cannot feel anything anymore but despair and hopelessness. I left behind all my dreams of being an artist or a sports teacher or a trainer (i really love working out) sadly I chose psychology to study and I cannot change it anymore nor study something else :( I don’t even have the energy left anymore anyway. 

I really hope my parents will take care of my cats, two strays I saved and raised from since they were the size of my palm. Maxine and Sissi, you kept me alive for a little more and you are the light of my life 🤍 I will remember your shiny, emerald eyes, your soft fur, and you purring on my chest as I pass away. 

I had so much love to give sadly I didn’t know how to give and receive , and I am also really scared of people deep down :( I dont know how to fit in and never knew. I tried to change my life inside and outside, I really tried it all. But now my soul is really worn out :( 
I would like to thank everyone who kept me alive for a little longer, anyone who ever tried even in the slightest to encourage me, and saw even the littlest potential in me. 
I am sorry I bit like a scared dog the hands of people who tried to help because I couldn’t distinguish anymore who was and who wasn’t well-meaning. I am so sorry :( I have many regrets in this life too, all them being I wasn’t a better person to the very little people who loved me. In my last moments, I hope they can forgive me and visit my grave or think about me from time to time. I am sending everyone so much love and gratitude, it was a difficult journey and a really painful one too. I think my soul has learned a lot in this painful lifetime. But it is enough. 

Mom, Dad, I love you. I forgive you for not being there for me. I hope you can forgive me too. My dear cats, I love you. My beloved ex bf, I forgive you for leaving and i’ll always love you. The friends I had and left, i’ll cherish the memories. And everyone who took their time to read until the end, thank you! Goodbye everyone!

"I don't know if I have passed my crisis point (which wasn't really a crisis imo) but killing myself right now seems like too much work. You will be surprised how much preparation and research you need to do to make sure you get it right i.e. minimizing pain. Hanging without finding the correct arteries is painful as fuck and just makes you slowly choke to death. Finding a place with a proper ligature where you will not be found and rescued is even harder. Shooting myself in the head needs impulse but the bullets are separated from the gun and I can't find them. I really wanted to die so I had to be SURE that I don't end up in a psych ward and be in constant surveillance until I die from natural causes. 


Something just clicked that all this work in trying to kill myself has lead me to this moment... imagine if I just put energy in getting out of my depressive funk? That or my new dose of prozac is kicking in.

Stay safe y'all."
"I'm suicidal and just made an attempt, i kinda regret it though? It tasted bad, It was a glass of salt water with around 120 grams of salt apparently 0.5-1 grams per kilo of bodyweight is enough to be lethal I weigh like 60-70kg

Hypernatremia should set in soon, it's 02:14 am, I live in Oslo Norway, and I kinda regret it, but I'm pretty sure I might die, painfully and agonizingly so

As of 2 hours ago, I'm 17 years old, help wtf do I do

Edit:

At the hospital, probably not dying, I've take 3 blood tests and I have a bunch of machines hooked up to me, but I'm not dead

Not how I wanted to spend my 17th birthday, lol

Edit 2: 

I'm in grippy sock jail (psych ward)and it's officially 17 hours since I drank ***the concoction*** :3

Edit 3:

Just spent the first night at the psych ward, bed is uncomfortable and the pillows feel like sandbags, but WOW heading other people's psych ward stories I feel lucky for having a private bathroom, and no cameras in my room, lol."
"I don’t really know why I’m posting this, I guess I feel like people here would understand. I feel so profoundly alone, I know I can talk to my loved ones, but I’ve seen how it breaks their hearts when I tell them how hopeless I feel. So I kept everything to myself and put on fake smiles and happy conversations and (I’m a recovering alcoholic) didn’t tell anyone about my relapses etc. I just wanted to be a normal person.

Last night I reached my wits end. I really tried to be better. I tried to keep everyone happy. But I can’t ignore this deep ache I feel in my heart and soul. An ache that feels like my very existence to the core is not natural, not meant to be there 

So I set up a noose on my curtain rail, wrote a short letter to say goodbye and sorry and got on a chair. My mom walked into my room as I was standing by the curtain and I managed to hide the noose and make an excuse about trying to fix my curtain, she said I should stop being silly and go get dinner, I told her I’d come just now but she wouldn’t let up. So.. I just slipped the rope on and jumped off the chair as fast I could. I thought it would kill me fast enough but instead I had my mom trying to hold my body up while I suffocated and my dad trying to cut the rope down with a knife. 

It’s the next day and I feel a thousand times worse that I put everyone through hell AND couldn’t even get the job done. I’m a horrible human being, because despite all of that, I still want nothing more than to stop existing. 
I truly don’t believe that I’ll ever be able to live a life that isn’t agonising for me 90% of the time. How does one ever come to terms with such a thing.

Edit: thank you so much to all the kind souls who offered me words of comfort, encouragement and helpful advice. I’m so incredibly grateful for the support and not feeling so alone through all of this. 

I am currently in a mental facility, voluntarily, to get the professional help I desperately need and being here has been helping me immensely. I won’t try to give anyone advice on how to deal with their thoughts and feelings, but I’m extremely grateful to have been given a chance to get help. I just had to be willing to ask for it. I’m taking things one day at a time. "
"Someone from this sub reached out to me yesterday, saying that they were going to end their life last night. I tried talking him out of it but he wouldn't budge. I asked him to call suicide hotline multiple times for which he obliged. Sadly every time he called, he'd say that they weren't helpful at all, saying that they'd just recommend breathing exercises and tell him cliché lines like it's going to be okay. He contacted them 3 times and it didn't work. He was suicidal because the love of his life left him. I even asked him to contact her so she'd comfort him but she had 0 sympathy for him which shocked me. He had no friends or family to reach out to and so he contacted me, a random person. But I failed and couldn't change his mind even after 12 hours of talking... I begged him to just stay alive one more day but he said he was just in too much pain. I know it's not entirely my fault but I can't help but feel like I just wasn't able to save him.."

"Throwaway account.  Daughter(14) tried to commit suicide Sunday night by taking a lethal dose of Tylenol and Advil.  Luckily school has been hitting the suicide hot line pretty hard with the students and she texted them before and after taking the pills.  They were able to convince her to give up our address.  Wife and I were home and had no idea until a frantic police man came up to the door.  Long story short, she survived with no permanent damage.  She started inpatient care yesterday.  We went thru her phone and the texts to the hot line indicate she has been having these feelings for two years.  We started going thru her room today and found her note.  It was addressed to her best friend and didn't even mention my wife and I.  That was a gut punch.  This was so out of the blue.  She is such a great kid.  Fantastic grades, lots of friends, very well liked at school, and highly empathetic towards others.  In her texts to the hot line, she was guilt ridden on how good her life was.  She couldn't understand why her life was so good when many others around her struggle with single parents, bad parents, poor, etc while she seems to have it all.  This is tearing me up.  We meet with the social worker tomorrow.  I assume family sessions will occur at some point.  She is on fall break this week, so her absence from school won't be noticed, but if she is out when school starts back up next week it is going to be harder and harder to explain.  I want her to stay as long as needed inpatient, but I'm scared how cruel teenagers can be if it gets out at school.  How do you manage all of this?"
"He was 24. We met when we were teenagers. We were in a romantic relationship for a while, broke up, and then decided to stay friends. He was the only person I could confide in. He faced a couple of setbacks and had a few shitty days and 2 months ago, killed himself. I woke up to a call from his boss saying he didn't show up to work (I was his emergency contact, that's how close we were). I went to his house and found him dead. I wont say what method he used. We were gonna move in together. Now I'm alone, I have no friends who I can talk about deep stuff with like I could with him. I saw how he did it and I want to copy him. I can't live the rest of my life with this feeling. I go on the suicide bereavement subreddit every day and see the pain that people are still in 10, 20 years on. I found comfort in knowing there are others who relate at first but now, it doesn't make me feel anything. I feel hopeless. I hated this world anyway even before this happened. It was me and him against the stupid culture we live in. Now I'm alone and I'm going to kill myself too."
"We were watching a documentary of suicide survivors in our health class and that line freaked everyone out, including one pretty vocal ""eww"". It's like they found that more shocking than the actual attempt. There's so much ignorance in regards to what depression actually looks like and it makes me so mad and frustrated."
"I've been addicted to pornography ever since I was nine years old. Every single fucking day, ever since I was a kid, I've been watching this filth for hours on end. I've had periods in my life where I've tried my very best to curb this addiction and get better, but everytime I make the slightest progress, I fall back into it, even worse than I was before.

I neglect my responsibilities. I don't do things that I have a deadline for, because I'm busy watching porn. I don't talk to my friends or family that much, because I'm busy watching porn. I don't workout anywhere near as much as I used to, because I'm busy watching porn. I don't do the things that I used to love doing, because I'm busy watching porn.

My fetishes get steadily more and more depraved. When I was a kid, I used to watch softcore, vanilla stuff. Now, I watch things that I legitimately cannot say. It makes me hate myself so fucking much. Whenever I finish, I feel like driving a knife in my aorta, or slitting my throat.

The absolute worst part of it all is that nobody believes this is a real addiction. Tell a person that you're addicted to alcohol, and they'll believe you. You have a heroin addiction? Oh, you poor soul! We can help you with that. But if you say: ""I have a porn addiction"", people'll tell you that it isn't real. Sure. It's not real. I want to kill myself for no fucking reason.

Please, tell me I'm not the only one."
"I'm just trapped

I know theres no way to fix myself but I cant say fuck it and do it"
"I have known my wife for as long as I can remember. I recently turned 50 years old. Half a century. We were childhood friends who got married as soon as we were both 18. Usually married couples that young tend to have regrets but never us. 
It has been a little over a month since she found out she had cancer. Stage 3 ovarian. It was gut-wrenching but she was so sure she could beat it. I think she truly believed that. This morning, she died.
I can’t even cry because I am just focused on going to where she is. I always knew that would be what happened if she went first, I just didn’t know it would be this soon. 
I don’t have any other family to tell so consider this my only goodbye message. I guess I do have some attachment to this world after all but not enough to keep me from her. I’m sorry. For all the rest of you, stay strong, if you can. Goodbye.
"
"That’s my default solution to any problem that arises. I’d rather die than deal with any more negative shit. I can’t handle stress, I can’t handle being alone, I can’t handle being around people, I can’t handle work, I can’t handle laying in bed all day. I just don’t want this. I don’t want to live and all I think about is finishing up with it. I just want my family and friends to say it’s ok, that I can go and they won’t be sad. I’m fortunate to have people that love and care about me but I’m just too tired to live. 
All I can think of is blowing my brains out. The idea of it is a relief. I can’t get a gun out here but even if I did I think that I’d be scared of the violence of it. I wonder if that means I don’t actually wanna die? I’d probably resort to swallowing my 6 months worth of antidepressants and xanax. Would that do the job? I also don’t wanna just get sick and then have to live my life in a worse state than before."
"random account. 

I’m 17, 5 months ago I self discovered myself as a pedophile, I looked at all the online resources  to figure everything a pedophile does, what occurs and the warning signs. I was determined to find out 

I was confused and stressed out and I still am because before that I was perfectly fine but sometimes it could occur later in puberty. 
It didn’t make sense, I liked girls my age and older so for that to happen was sad. 

Never looked at cp, but my inhibitions feel weak, I’m pushing through it. after finding out that it was true, I took meds to see if It could go away forever, ssris and sleep stuff. I’m on  40mg of Prozac. It still is happening and I have a high sex drive. I wanna try something to get rid of my libido. 

I knew pedophiles stared at kids, and thought to myself i would never do that. But it manifested 
I do long stares at kids, no thoughts just 
 compulsion and repressed thoughts that form nothing. I just want it to stop because I want to go back to normal I’m still 17 I want to live life.

I’ve been turned by  thoughts, but I feel super ashamed. it’s only happened 8 times.  

I feel so unlucky to be born that way, everything was going awesome and I had to born a pedophile. If I could find a fix. I would do it immediately.

"I am currently a blind epileptic psychologist who works at a psychiatric hospital. My current role is to support clients before, during, and for 2 years after their discharge. The role was created to reduce suicides and to prevent readmissions

I can't cope anymore. It isn't my work  - it's everything else. I don't want to be blind. I don't want to depend on others. I don't want to have Bipolar, GAD, and PTSD. This isn't the life I chose or magined.

I'm struggling so much, and I feel like I don't deserve to be here. I feel so worthless, despairing, exhausted, and helpless. It feels like my existence has never really  mattered. I feel like I wasn't made to be here. I'm invisible to the people around me.

I feel like my life has run it's course and I hope that no one else here has to experience this pain. 

I can understand why some of my clients made the choice to end their lives, and I hope they found the peace they were looking for.

I've been gathering means over the last few months. Everything is so hard.

My clients are so valued and needed. They deserve the world and every possible positive experience. Each one of them has a bright, unique light that I know will guide them through their darkest times. I hope they know/knew how much I care(d)

"In truth, I actually used to enjoy it years ago. Then, I went to college because I wanted more fulfilling work. Then, I started a business, and even though it's been successful, it's taking longer than I anticipated to fully set up so I can't live off the profits yet. 

So... I had to default to my former work to temporarily makes ends meet and... I'm remembering how dehumanizing it is. I've only been back at it a month and have already had to visit the ER to do a rape kit, have already been facef\*\*\*ed so hard I threw up (despite having not eaten anything that day), have already torn countless times, have already had every 'minor' boundary ignored, and have already lost my sanity having to sleep during the day so I can be available at night. Dehumanizing is an understatement, and the money is only worth it if it's a stepping stone to a better future, and a close one at that.   

I'm dreading the 15th when I have to be back at it until July. My depression is coming back and I really need things to work for me... otherwise... I'll perish."

"This is an update to my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depressed/s/aJfYvgCwJf)

Today's the day, and tonight's the night. I don't really have anything planned for today really, just do the chores my parents gave me, proofread my letter one more time, and just pass the time with video games and YouTube until tonight. I've already scouted out where I want to do it. Not at my house since I don't want to scar my family any more than what they're already gonna be from this. I plan on doing it at my local park. It's got a big field way on the outskirts of it. Peaceful, with a good view of the stars too. I plan on waiting until everyone goes to sleep tonight, take my last shower at about 10 pm, and write 2 more on-paper notes. One for my family to find in my room, telling them to call the police and telling them the location of my body, and one on my body telling the police that my suicide letter is on my phone in my notes app. I'll walk to the park somewhere between 12 - 3 am and just look at the stars for a while. Might drink a little too, play some music. Once I've said my prayers and my last words, turn my gun onto myself, pull the trigger, and see what happens from there. These past few days have been strangely peaceful actually. Feels like I've got control of my life for once and that I actually know what's gonna happen.

I'd like to thank everybody who left comments or sent me pms after my last post. All of you are amazing people and you will hopefully go on to do great things with your lives. Thank you for giving some comfort in my final days. 🖤

If I somehow survive or the gun jams I'll give you guys another update, but this is most likely gonna be my last post. Farewell everyone.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/s/JeOdNhUcVm)"
"Last year she first told me she didn't want to be alive anymore. She was 7. I got her in with a great therapist who she still sees.

A month ago she did that phrase again. We made a safety plan at therapy. Two days later she threatened to bring a gun to school so I took her to the hospital for an evaluation. Cue us being held for 8 hours in the most dehumanizing experience only to be told not only did they have nowhere for her to go due to her age, but that her threats weren't credible anyways and we got sent home.

Tonight she got upset over something minor and completely went over the edge. Said she doesn't understand why she feels this way, why she has these thoughts. She wanted to kill herself although she didn't make specific threats. She then asked her sister to kill her. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm doing everything right... She's in therapy, she doesn't have a history of experiencing abuse or trauma, we went to the hospital and it was NOT helpful .. so what's next?"
"Writing this here because bottling this up is killing me on the inside. The guilt and anxiety has been building for a decade and I just can't take it anymore.

My parents hired her when I was 10. I'd nearly burned the house down while home alone the month prior and they were too busy working to look after me themselves. My dad wanted a professional nanny but my mom insisted on hiring her childhood friend; I'll just call her Sarah. Sarah had just lost her job as a nurse and my mom wanted to help her get back on her feet.

I hated her immediately. Her hair was ratty, her breath smelled like fish and she seemed to think cheap perfume was a substitute for bathing. The first few months were fine but she quickly started pushing boundaries. It's weird to say but she'd treat me like one of her girl friends. She'd go on for hours about abusive ex boyfriends and childhood bullies and drunken one night stands, always making sure to swear me to secrecy afterwards.

My clubs and sports were my only time I got away from her but she convinced my parents that they were interfering with my grades and got me pulled out of them. After a year, my routine was coming straight home, hanging out with Sarah for 6 hours and going to sleep. I'm not going into detail but that's when the assaults began.

My grades immediately took a hit and so did my sleep. It all came to a head one day when I got a detention for falling asleep during a test. My dad was called in and after a few minutes of him questioning me about what was going on, I told him everything. That's the closest I ever saw him get to crying. When we got home, he and mom had an hour long screaming match where both blamed the other for 'letting this happen.' I was scared but also hopeful that it might finally be over.

However, the next night when I came home from school the energy had changed completely. Sarah was at the table along with both my parents and it looked like they'd been talking for some time. They told me to sit and asked if I had anything to say for myself. I asked what they meant and my mom said that Sarah had told her everything.

Apparently, Sarah had spent the day making me out to be some sort of sex obsessed pervert who'd been harassing and groping her for months. She had flipped every accusation I'd made back around on me and, infuriatingly, my parents had sided with her. I obviously denied all of it at first but after an hour and a half of my dad grilling me and picking my words apart I began to think it really was my fault. By the end of the conversation, I was tearfully apologizing to Sarah for my disgusting behavior and promising to never lie again.

The next day when I got home Sarah was there again. She made me say sorry for sharing 'our secret' and the assaults began again. It continued like that for another 3 years and this time I stopped trying to resist. Normally I'd spend my days brainstorming ways to avoid her but by then I'd figured there was nothing I could do. I developed a sort of helplessness that killed all my motivation and followed me long after she was gone.

I know it could have been worse but the ordeal really screwed up how I see things. I've been depressed, anxious and friendless ever since with no signs of it changing. I have mild pancreatitis from drinking and scars on my arms from self harm. When I try talking to my parents about it they just gaslight me. I've tried church, therapy and meds but nothing works. I just don't want to feel like this anymore."
"She died 5 days ago after being hospitalised for 2 weeks.

We had been together since high school. Married on 7th July 2023.  She was my best friend, my home and core to all my dreams. 

We shared all our values and life goals, we wanted a family and children. We wanted to see the world and build careers that would let us make a difference. 

She wanted to help victims of violent crimes, she had endless empathy for people and the courage to try to empower those who had suffered from the most horrific crimes.

She followed me from our home in Helsinki to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania where I got a job soon after our wedding. We loved our lives there. She was blossoming, made the sweetest friends, and was working the perfect job that allowed her to work remotely while I worked my office job.

9th August 2024 she falls ill, I figure it's just a flu as I had one too and she tends to always get hit by the flu harder than me. For a full 24 hours I just take care of her at home, thinking rest is all she needs. The next day she is delirious, I still think this might just be a combo of the flu and the aural migraines she would often get. We get to the hospital around midday. It's malaria. I still think: ""they know exactly how to treat malaria here, she'll be just fine""

2 weeks of fighting, complication after complication. On the 24th of August 2024, at 9AM, the doctors tell us her brain herniated, she was brain dead. The next 16 hours we watched her body give up. We were sobbing, sleeping and staring into the void over what was basically already a corpse being kept ""alive"" by tubes and medication. Tanzanian law would not allow her to be unplugged at the moment of brain death. 25th August 3AM, she is pronounced dead.

I'm back in Finland now at my parents' house. I have barely left my childhood bedroom. I dont have a home anymore. I lost my best friend, my first and only love, my future.

I'm in agony, the memories of our life together and her tubed corpse swirling in my head. I dont know how to live without her, I dont know how to function. I feel so alone, despite family and friends trying to be there for me.

I would not want to live, but I cant hurt my family more than they are already hurting. They loved her like a daughter.

I just want my home back, I want to be loved like she loved me.

"I havent harmed anyone, and i dont have any photos/videos of children. 

I have had thoughts though and I can feel my eyes linger.

To be clear if i do kill myself its not for any moral act of good. It would 100% be a selfish

My life sucks without the fact im probably a pedophile. 

I have no friends. I am unable to form any social interactions. I am barely able to function as an adult. Im horribly depressed. My life is continually deteriorating.

The pedophile aspect is just an extra ""Is there anything to even salvage here?"". 

I think hey do myself a favour and do the world a favour. End it now while im still a sad tale, then i can like contribute to suicide awareness or someshit.

If i end it later i live a sad life, achieve nothing and people will piss on my grave."
"im 14(f) and was gang raped by my very first group of friends.
at 6 i was raped by my brother and that already affected me, the group knew how much it hurt me, but they did it anyway.
that group was the first group i came out to as gay, and there was one other girl (13)
the guys (17,15,13,13,12) used her against me.
that girl was my childhood best friend, i related to her more than anyone else.
i cant sleep at night because i can feel their ""fluids"" on my face, on my body, in my hair, in my mouth, in my eyes,
i can taste it.
im horrified.
i feel so disgusting and all i feel is it dripping off my skin,
i hate how fast my heart beats.
everynight i have flashbacks and non stop panic attacks.
i haven't told anyone, not even my parents. they only know ""something"" happened but they didnt believe me, and they said even if it did happen it was my own fault.
one of the guys keeps texting me and everytime i block him he makes a new account. he triggers me so badly.
im so tired and just want to die.
it hurts so bad and theres so many other things taht make me want to just leave.
i was severely bullied through the ages of 4-13, and never had any friends. this group was the VERY first to group to EVER like me. ive now moved schools and its actually a lot better, but the effects of literally everyone hating me still linger. i still remember vividly when a guy stomped on my foot so hard it broke, or getting slush slammed into my face, or getting shoved down stone stairs, or getting dragged by the hair. i remember hearing what people would say about me, and now thats all i can think about. what people might be thinking about me, or what they want to do to me. im sick of feeling everyones eyes on me. im sick of always feeling judged. it feels like everyone around me can see the handprints of the group still on my body. i just want to sleep, i want to sleep so so bad. ive been awake for 40 hours and i doubt ill manage to get sleep tonight. im so tired.

im sorey about how messy this is but im so scared i just want to leave please help me im so tired"
"I loaded a .308 rifle with 3 rounds. Already wrote a note. Planning on going out in the woods and shooting myself twice in the chest and once in the head, should be enough to end it without the possibility of surviving. 

I remember being a kid full of hopes and dreams, going outside to play with a stick and pretending to be an astronaut while swinging on a vine. Never would have thought it would get to this point. 

Disowned from my entire family due to my lack of religious belief, no friends, no partner, no job, no hobbies, nothing. There is no point in life, there is no reason to continue when you’ve lost before you ever began. 

It’s almost comedic how tragic and catastrophic my life has been. Well, goodbye Reddit. People on Reddit were nicer to me than anyone in my real life was. "
"Pretty much the title. But it’s a lie; I have a reason to go on. She’s 14 and she loves me, I know she would be lost without a mom. But I’m so fucking lonely. And so humiliated and tired. 

ETA: he’s known her since she was 13. She was friends with my kids. Hence, groomer. 

Edit 2: I get it, I should leave. She’s a legal adult. Yeah, yeah. 

We both have VERY public jobs in a VERY small town. Blowing this up would be humiliating for us all. Should I? Yes! Will I? I’m not strong enough. Hence, this post. "
It’s like my family doesn’t care anymore. They just say “oh it’s just what he does”. But it’s weird. He also used to bully me for being bigger. I lost weight because I forget to eat sometimes. Now he says this shit.
"I don't get it, it's a permanent solution which means you won't have any other problems. If it works it works, it's still a solution."
"i lost my 3 best friends in the entire world because i told 1 (one) of them about how a suicide attempt on thanksgiving lead to me going to the ER and getting treatment. then they all started ignoring me. then individually texted me saying they do not want to be around me nor speak to me. they said my anxiety ""takes over all our conversations"" and when i have panic attacks and PTSD attacks it stresses them out. these attacks being, of course, something i cannot control and haven't been able to control for the last 4 years we've been a great friend group. they said they can't be friends with someone who tried to kill themselves because it stresses them out too much.

this is high school, obviously. and they're glaring at me and telling other people not to talk to me and talking bad about me and pointing at me and it's just making me more suicidal. someone for the love of god tell me it gets better after high school. if it doesn't, there's a suicide note in my notes app for all of you.

edit: i love this subreddit. thank you to everyone. even just the smallest bit of support makes me calm down enough to think clearly. thank you thank you thank you. you all deserve the most.

P.S. i am in fact a 17 year old girl not a guy but i get the confusion &lt;3

  
EDIT 6 MONTHS AFTER ISSUE: so, update. it took 6 months, but i'm in a slightly better place with the girls i talked about. i've never gotten an apology, and i'm still hurt, but i forgive them immediately BECAUSE i'm in high school and i HAVE to spend time with them, so i might as well not be dreading every day.

my main friend i lost was given a personalized note by me after we closed our run of footloose at our school. she then, a few days later, hugged me for a very long time and kept repeating that she really liked the note. i'm now unblocked and not terrified to speak to her or be around her anymore, so that's a HUGE help with MY mental health. i've known her for years and apologies are not something she has done or ever WILL do, but instead it's little gestures like laughing at my jokes, offering to take pictures of me when i look cute, and grabbing my hands when she wants to talk to me. in an ideal world i would tell her that we're not going to be friends until i am apologized to. but i need to survive without hating my life every day.

the second good friend i lost just kind of fell back into easy rapport with me. she was the one i know was being manipulated into staying away from me. 

the third one is one i know has continued shit talking me and making (very vague) things up about me. i'm super stressed about that still because i just want to be in a good standing with all of my peers, but a friend of mine reminded me recently that this is all PROGRESS, and that reminder makes me endlessly happy.

  
to you all, THANK YOU. i am shocked i didn't have another attempt on my life in these past few months. coming back to these comments and reminders was a safe space for me. thank you."
"I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (21M) for 2.5 years, and he has made it clear he wants kids from the beginning. I’m diagnosed with autism and was always pretty firm on not wanting kids, but he made me feel like we would be able to handle it together if we had kids, so slowly over time I came around to the idea.

A year and a half ago, I got pregnant but we were in a bad financial position, so I had an abortion early on. It was a mutual agreement, and I moved past it pretty easily, but he was really torn up about it. I told him when we’re able to bring a kid into the world, we would go through with it.

Since then I’m making a lot more money and he also has a job now. Back in January of this year, I found out I’m pregnant, and expected to deliver at the end of August. He was very excited and told me he wanted me to keep it, and although for the longest time I didn’t want kids, I genuinely saw a future with this man and thought having a kid together was a beautiful thing.

Sometime in the last two months, he has gone from being excited about the baby— sharing ultrasound pictures, wanting to make sure I’m drinking enough water and eating enough for me and the baby— to not wanting this kid at all. He told me he realized he’s not ready for kids, and he’s not willing to “throw his whole life away” for one kid. He realized he doesn’t want to give up his own personal freedom and playing video games all day/not having any major responsibilities. Don’t get me wrong, those are all reasons I didn’t want to have kids in the first place and I communicated that to him, but back in January, he talked me into changing my mind because I thought “I love this man, we can actually support this child now, and my love is so strong that I want to start a family”.

Now he’s giving me my options. We’re saving up for our own place, and my parents have money, so they let us stay at their house and we have our own bedroom and living room. They are EXTREMELY excited and supportive about a grandchild. I’m so grateful for them. But my bf says either he’s leaving once the baby is here and I have to be a single mom, we have to give the baby up for adoption and get kicked out by my parents, or to stage an accident to cause a late miscarriage and say it was a mistake. I’m pro choice but I’m 28 weeks pregnant, and he(the baby) moves around a lot, this is a real baby, nothing like the abortion I had at 6 weeks. I’m not a monster.

But I only changed my mind about kids because I thought we were going to do this together, he wanted it so bad. Now he’s completely flipped and talks about how unwanted this baby is for him and how he should have never convinced me to keep the pregnancy. I thought maybe he was just scared and he wasn’t good at showing it, but he’s made it clear he wants nothing to do with raising a child. Without a partner to co parent with, I would have never wanted this kid. I don’t want this kid to grow up with a regretful single mom or a dad who doesn’t want him.

My boyfriend says he loves me and wants nothing bad to happen to me, but I can’t raise a kid by myself. I don’t think I’m high functioning enough to do it without the other parent, but everyone tells me I’ll be an amazing mother. But my baby deserves so much better than me. No one is going to want to date and marry an autistic single mom who’ll never be able to drive. I thought I was super lucky with my boyfriend, and now I feel so blindsided.

Once my baby is born, I’m going to kill myself. My boyfriend can find someone to move in with, he’d have to anyway if he’s going to leave once the baby is here anyway. I’m saving up money and buying lots of baby items so it isn’t as big of a financial burden to my parents. My parents are amazing people and tell me I can live at home with the baby as long as I would like, so I feel comfort knowing they’ll have my baby to remember me by, and my son will have such a loving household.

I can’t tell anyone this, so I came here to get this off my chest. I’m going to cherish the last two months I have with my boyfriend and my family. I never wanted to be a single mom, and I can’t bare to think about seeing my baby every day and him looking like my boyfriend, thinking how he’s gone back on his word hurts so bad. I would’ve just had another abortion and looked into better birth control if he had realized he didn’t want kids back then. We could have been a happy childfree couple. I hope when my son is older, he’ll understand. "
"I'm 15 and I did a very stupid thing, me and a girl from my class were ""dating"" while texting she told me to send explicit photos I rejected at first but she kept insisting and I eventually did, she has shared those photos with her friend group and they are now threatening me with the photos and how they would share them with people if i didn't do what they ordered, a few days ago they told me to do sexual things with them I said no they are now threatening me on how they're gonna tell people I raped one of them.

becouse of something i did wheni was 6
I dont think i can live with my self anymore.
 When iwas 6 years old i was one day at my grandmas house visiting for the weekend.
 While there we were watching a movie one night and were watching a movie on late
at night and there was a sex scene on it 
and it was my fist time seeing anything like that so ofc i was curious about it and just glanced at it but nothing weird happened then and we webt to sleep. The next evening my cousin is there and i get a bright idea of copying what they did in the movie with my 4yo cousin... it didnt
feel wrong to me at that Point nor did it for 6 years untill i was 12 when i was tought about rape and incest. After the day i fully realized what i have done i havent been
the same, and on top of that when she turned 15 she has gotten Severe depression and started to take meds, i blame myself every day for it. I cant sleep anymore, i roll in bed for hours
dreading the day somebody gets to know what i did and if someone does idk if i can handle life anymore.
Tldr i basically raped my cousin when i was 6 and dont
know how to live knowing im a rapist pedo.
Should i end myself?"

What’s the point of trying to love in a world full of hate? What’s the point of trying to do something good in a world full of injustice? How can i feel good about myself when there are children in a neighboring country starving to death, burnt alive by another human and nobody cared about them at all? I can’t bear this anymore"
"I have been keeping a big secret for 4 years now. My family thinks I have been going to university for the past 4 years but little did they know, including my friends and relatives, that i dropped out in the middle of the first semester of my freshman year. I managed to keep it a secret from all of them by forging false documents and giving them assurance every time they ask me a question about how my academics was going. It also helps that the University is 2 hours away from my home so I actually rent near it. I go home every weekend thinking ""do they know already?"". I know a lot about my field as I practice it every now and then by working with a licensed engineer. I don't make a lot of money from it though but the things I learned that is connected to the degree program is what kept me from blanking when asked by my family about my academic life.

I have run out of time. The graduation from the University is 10 days away and everyone thinks I am graduating. And I am somewhat happy, that I can finally end my life. I have been such a big disappointment for my parents. I am their only child. I cry everytime I imagine what my mom would feel after I do it. My girlfriend, who by the way also doesn't know anything broke up with me yesterday, which makes the goodbye part of it all very hard. I have planned everything out already, from what i'll use to when and where. I just wanted to vent some of the heaviness from my chest. I feel so sad about my parents and my (ex) girlfriend. I am gonna start writing my suicide letters tomorrow. Thank you guys."
"I’ve been raped multiple times in my life by multiple people starting at the age of 8 and most recently 14. 

This has really fucked me up mentally to the point that I started purposely getting myself into dangerous situations with pedophiles so I could get money or alcohol so at least I could get something out of it.

I stopped for a while but I’ve started doing it again. I just hate myself so much. It’s not even illegal anymore because I’m 16. And I guess I probably deserved it if I’m being such a slut now. 

I hate myself. My innocence and everything is gone already no one wants to have normal sex. Only creepy people who want to hurt me do. I’m scared of getting raped so I stop it happening by consenting and getting alcohol and money out of it.

I feel so stupid and alone. I want to stop but at the same time I don’t. I think one of these days I’m going to have to go to a mental hospital. I’m going mad I feel depressed and suicidal. I want to be innocent again but that can’t happen so I just give into the fact I’ll never have that and to people I’ll always be a broken slut who doesn’t deserve a life."
"I pulled the trigger on my 1851 navy to my head. it hangfired and I jerked it away last half second and it put a hole in my roof. Why did it not kill me, why am i still alive. Im shaking. It happened 5 minutes ago. My parents are crying. I'm only 17. Why did I do this. My right ear hurts really bad.

I'm another failed fucking attempt."
"I (13f) just woke up from last night after attempting to kill myself. I layed there for almost 2 hours thinking about everything and it gave me the strength to keep going. I thought about all the things I wouldn’t have got to do. Going to high school, graduating, having kids, moving to indiana (the state I wanna live in, dont ask). I believe this really changed me because you dont really realize how much you regret it till you try it. It was such an odd experience. Waking up with everything still, phone charged, messages from people that werent aware it couldve been a message I would’ve never read.

This is my sign, its not gonna be easy but im gonna get thru. Im gonna pull thru. 

Also thanks to eminem for his music keeping me sane when I woke up."
"Yesterday I went shopping to a mall. I wasn't sure in which shop to go to. I saw barely teenage girl go to gone to a shop. Without thinking, I went there too. Then I started to feel like a fucking stalker.

I didn't try to even walk to her. I had to take distance from her, and forced myself to shrug it off. I then saw her with her mom, and I felt even worse.

I have OCD. But I don't think it makes me confuse underage girls online with women in their early twenties.

I remember how I have sometimes seen a hot ""woman"" online.

Then I've seen a post mention she's fucking underage. And she looked over that for me.

I have barely ever gotten such thoughts.

I feel so fucking shit about this. I want to die. What the fuck can I even do to change my brain. It's fucking retarded. Why the fuck do I sometimes find an underage person hot?!

Yes, age of consent is a societal construct. Biology is far behind that.

This doesn't mean it's ok to be a pedophile.

But what the fuck can I do about this?!

I just realized this about myself. I'm fucking crying now. I am so fucking done with life. I have never been accepted by people because I am fucking ugly and neurodivergent. I am already suicidal. And now I'm also a fucking pedophile. I can't fucking take this. I just want to fucking die. What the hell did I do to be born into such a person?! There's nothing I can fucking do!

I've thought that I've just been always the victim to people. Yeah, I've been done heavily wrong.

But I also realized that I don't even deserve love or acceptance. I don't deserve hope when I have a brain like this.

Never once have I ever tried to sexually even approach underage people, approach at all.

When I was a teenager, I found a girl 2-3 years older than me to be attractive. And there were another guy and we kind of played with her and her younger brother. I was underage too.

And I've felt so fucking shit about that as well.

I want to fucking kill myself."
"I know it’s my fault.  He was in a vulnerable state and I’ve been supporting him the best I can but I’m going through shit too especially I’m hormonal from getting my IUD put in. I told him I was thinking about suicide and he just instantly blocked me on everything. Didn’t break up with me, nothing, just blocked and changed his relationship status. I’m so hurt and upset. I thought I could trust him. I thought he loved me. I should’ve known better. I am not lovable. I am worthless, pathetic, stupid piece of shit that everyone learns to hate eventually. I’ve got to be the problem… anyway in the past 24 hours I’ve taken maybe 7 pills of klonopin? And I also chugged a twisted tea and a monster. Now I feel hot and dizzy. But I think I’ll be fine right? Not gonna die? Unless I decide to finish the job with the 104 cogentin pills I’ve been hoarding. And more alcohol. We will see, I have yet to decide. I mean my head is already saying yes but part of me is holding back and I don’t know why. Nothing gets better. I’m going to die alone. I’m a horrible person. I want to die I want to fucking die I want to die. Stop being scared you fucking idiot. You deserve this and everyone will be better off for it. Just swallow the pills. Then you’ll finally feel safe. 

Update: wow, thank you for all the support, everyone. It means a lot to me and makes me feel like my thoughts and feelings are valid, so thank you. As for me wanting to off myself, I still do, but the desire isn’t as intense as before. Either way, my friend kinda talked me down and I promised them that I will call them first if I feel like I’m about to do it. Oh and btw, still no contact from him. I’ll update again if need be, but this is how things are right now. Thank you again for all the support &lt;3"
"I’m checking myself into hospital if i get to that point. But the damage has been done.     
I completely went into some kind of catatonic state and walked for an hour and a half around our city. I slashed by wrists deeper than i’ve ever done in my life on that walk. 
 My gf freaked out and i haven’t spoken to her at all since i first got back. My best friend found me. He’s the only one who talked to me when I got back. He hasn’t spoken to me since. I could barely speak. My legs are still in bits. I have slashes covering my arms including some that bled too much. The only reason i’m still here is because I threw up my guts last night.     
If i’ve lost these people I may as well try again. If i’m not hospitalised tomorrow, i’ll go home and stab myself, take every pill in this goddamn house and leave my body for whoever to find it.


   Why did they abandon me. I don’t understand why if they were worried, they have completely vanished? "
"i got no friends, and no family, so i figured i could atleast say it here. i don't want help, don't want to talk, just want you to remember this post on new years eve "
"From the very beginning we have been brainwashed into thinking that our life's are precious and we all suffer due to a reason and all that kind of crap. 

Well the reality is this shit ain't precious. It's hell. As you read this there are murders, r**es, theft and what not happening in the world. There is freaking war going on right now. People dying left right and centre. 

You open your eyes when you are born and are on the mercy of luck. The parents you get, the household, the money and all. If you happen to be born in a first world nation, life's competitively easy but if you are born a woman in Afghanistan. It's worse than hell. 

This world makes no sense and I can't wait to get out of it. "
"26f here. I said goodbye to my family last night without them knowing it was the last goodbye. I’ve been planning my suicide for a few weeks now. I went to the store this last week and bought a gun to kill myself with. That was the last thing I technically needed to do on my list. I have the place picked out and my goodbye letter written out. I took care of my stuff so my family won’t have to. It’s all packed up and labeled. I pre paid and planned my own funeral. I wrote down any work, medical or business related information that they would need to know and anyone they would need to contact. I left my bank info with logins and made my parents the beneficiaries. 
There’s just no point in living if I can’t be happy for even just one day. I’ve been waking up depressed every single day for two years and counting. I’m tired of feeling this way. I have nothing and no one. Sometimes when it feels like things get a little better, things suddenly derail. It’s like a never ending cycle. So yeah I can confidently say I’m at peace with dying. It actually sounds really nice right about now. My life’s a joke anyways."
"This isn't the ""coward's"" way out. It really isn't.

Even though I'm unbelievably fortunate this method is relatively painless, quick, and unassuming enough not to look gruesome, a part of me *is* scared. I used to say ""when I have a peaceful method, it'll be easy.."" but now that the time has come, I was really naive. I believe in the afterlife and consciousness after death, but I honestly don't mind if I am just unaware and I'm no more troubled than when I'm asleep..

To the people reading, I am so, so sorry you are trapped in atrocious circumstances or suffering such as war, unjust treatment, domestic violence, inescapable poverty, loneliness, crimes against humanity, the terror of being your biological gender but not having the resources and support to transition, and so many other injustices you do not deserve. This world is unabashedly brutal and horrible and I'm disheartened and disgusted that this the world we live in. I see you're trying to defend your fire against forces greater than yourself, and I am proud of you for living another day. Some days are more overpowering than others, but I want you to understand that is no reflection of inherent unworthiness or lack on your part. You are doing what you can with the tools (if any exist) you understand how to use, so please do not beat yourself up more than you are already breaking. Thank you for the chance you read this and we met. I wish to you all for external and internal resources come your way, freedom from suffering, empowerment, autonomy, courage, healing, resilience, personal fulfillment, growth, mercy and comfort for yourself, total fulfillment of your basic and inherent needs, and an abundance moments of expansive and loving joy. ♡

I even wish this for the people that have hurt me or willingly harmed others, because if we all possessed these things—especially the latter (as suffering is inevitable to some degree)—there would be no need or desire to cause harm. They could connect with others and themselves in the most positive and fulfilling of ways. At least.. that's how I feel.

I wish I could have made a great and bright impact on the world. The reason I am probably so hesitant is that my life has barely begun. I'm twenty years old. If I gave myself twenty to thirty years, I could probably gauge my impact, figure out what is wrong and strive for something better for everyone. I wish everyone felt that way to some degree. Though, some people are afraid of opening Pandora's box and don't realize they're actually in it.

If you read all this, thank you for reading. I hope I could make your day a little bit better. Thank you.

  
**Update (10/04/24)** :

I missed my ticket.  A few days ago, I tried to die and woke up the next morning with the most excruciating migraine and bodily weakness of my life. I still feel a bit weak. I see where I messed up a step and why I lived.  As of now, I'm on the margins of figuring out what to do next. Even though mind is in a weird place, I do know that I'd like to thank and hug everyone who felt moved by my note. 

It is fact there is endless and boundless suffering in life. I am so sorry you cannot escape your undeserved agony, and I have my deepest compassion for your trying. You do not deserve this in the first place. For those whose suffering is more than they are capable of enduring, and whose challenges are practically insurmountable, I send you the highest and brightest peace, self-love and courage and my respect for your autonomy to make the best possible choice for yourself. To those who choose to pursue living, I eagerly support you to continue! I know it is hard. This cycle of inner struggle—spiraling, self-doubt, bitterness, frustration, delusion—is baked into our humanity, and we may never fully step out of that cycle until our last breath. But you know what? While we are alive, I rejoice in the days, moments, minutes, and seconds to spare you aren't caught in that cycle and feel connected with and free.

I purposely didn't elaborate what pushed me to suicide in my note, because this note isn't about me; it is about you. Whether you sobbed, felt your stomach drop in fear, or clenched your fists in self-frustration, I dream you confront what your subconscious yearns for and achieve it. 

If I may include, this world *is* unbelievably fucking awful and cruel and full of suffering. I cannot dress up that undeniable truth in pretty words and still keep my integrity.

 Knowing this—nearly dying—I realize there are things I wanted to do. I wanted to make the world a better place. I wanted to make people smile, to make people laugh. I wanted to lower people's guards and help them feel joy again. I wanted to ease people's stress and invite laughter. I wanted to help people open their Pandora's box and show them there is still merit in staying in this world despite the horrors. I wanted every interaction I have to be raw, energetic, vulnerable, and alive, so that no one ever felt warranted to question my intentions; instead, they remember the humanity flowing in their veins. I wanted to wake up every morning and feel self-confident from sunrise to sunset, knowing that this is the gift I would deliver to you personally, and I would do it again and again and again. 

...Now, despite that..

 ..I am just as much as hesitant to live as I was to die. Even though I feel in tune with my life's purpose, the lack of noise in death fulfills a large part of me that life cannot. If I had given myself another twenty-five to thirty years, I could have departed on my deathbed with my head held high and spine erect. But that isn't now. Frankly, a part of me wishes it were. I type this in hopes that maybe it will resonate with someone out there, and know that you aren't alone in feeling this way. 

Thank you for reading this. Have a good day, everyone. ♡"
"I’m in court for something I’m not proud of at all and won’t disclose here, right now i feel like its 70/30 on if I top myself or not. Chances are the press are gonna get a hold of it and I’m gonna lose all my family and friends and not be able to show my face around anywhere, never have a job never meet a woman and have kids, I know for a fact my life is gonna be over within 24 hours so why should I continue it, on top of that I have severe anxiety and depression but have never really been able to open up about it so it is haunting me sitting in court hearing them all talk about me and how they’re going to deal with me. I think this is gonna be my last last few hours here tbh "
"Last year, I was raped. I tried to report it to my manager. He thought I was lying, even when I cried begging him to investigate it. He forced me to take time off, over which time he happened to hear allegations about me from anonymous sources. I had to leave. I have not been able to get work since, in part due to the rumors they spread about me. 

Noone from the organisation has spoken to me in a while now. I've had some therapy, but those have run out now. I havent had dreams for close to a year, only nightmares. 

I am incredibly isolated. The only reason I haven't ended myself is because my husband talked me out of it. But I'm on the brink. We considered moving city but my reputation has been that tarnished. 

I don't know what to do. I was raped, I tried to report it, and now I feel ruined.

"I hate being autistic and literally unable to read the FUCKING ROOM. My grandpa was dying like actively and his breaths were getting more shallow and then like I couldn't tell if he stopped so for some dumb ass reason I reached to check for a pulse on his neck and my grammie got upset and my sister snapped at me. Like bro what the actual fuck is wrong with me why would I EVEN think that would be appropriate?? It's literally always like that, I overshare, I don't connect with people properly, I never seem to act appropriate in social situations. I'm so fucking sick of myself. I've got a long drive back home after all this. Hella pills at home, gonna get some liqour at some point. I can't handle myself anymore. I'm fucking annoying it's just gotten too much and I've really crossed a line at this point. Fuck this shit. I'm gonna grab all my shit, head down to my favorite creek, and peace the fuck out. I miss my grandpa, but hopefully I won't have to miss him for long. 

Edit: I'm fine, getting help, thank you guys. Taking a second chance I guess. "
"It sounds incredible, but I've become so comfortable with the idea of killing myself that I just feel so relaxed. I went for a walk for three hours yesterday, and I felt so much peace knowing these would be the last days in a world I tried hard to belong to, but couldn't. I've been reading this subreddit nonstop and am so happy at the lives that are saved here. To anyone reading this who saved someone, God bless you for what you did. God bless you if you feel the need to save me, even though you won't. You all deserve to live and experience the joy of the world. Thank you for this."
"We have a four month old. Husband gets full night rest, goes on runs, goes climbing, sees friends. I get 4-5 hours of sleep since he was born. I’m not allowed to take a nap. We fight every day in front of our son. I feel awful. I can’t get space. He forces our son on me when I’m crying, when I shower. I begged for sleep this weekend and of course that started a four day fight. I don’t want my son to think this fighting and crying and yelling is normal. I want to die. Everyone thinks my husband is a nice guy. If I was gone my husband would probably be a good dad. I love my son so much and I think he’s better off without me. His family has money and they love my son. I have no family friends money. I have an awful credit score and 10k in debt collection. I don’t see a way out of this.  I feel so sad because I had the potential and plans to be an awesome mom, it’s all I wanted. I love him. But he gets a shell of who I am. His dad curses and yells at me for asking for sleep. I wail and it’s the saddest sound I’ve ever heard. It’s uncontrollable. He just tells me I’m hopeless and stop crying."
"it took me 34 years to get a girlfriend and she left after 4 months because i didnt have any experience navigating women and even i met her through the weridest of circumstances.

but now its all over, i literally get zero matches with online dating and most women wont even give me a chance, she gave me a chance but shes gone and my life is over so i am going to end it all!"
"I hate being a woman. 

I hate it, I hate it so much.
I hate the misogyny, the sexism, the double standards the objectification, the fact there's literally subs called r/women are things on here.

I hate it all, I hate the people who do it, men they all do it to me.

I hate them, I hate myself, I wish I was born a man, I hate the fact I don't have rights to my own body.

I hate the fact im seen as less, I hate the fact that I'm constantly sexualized when I'm not doing anything sexual, I hate it all.

I hate it, I wish I was a man my life would be easy "
"It’s bullshit when people say “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” the temporary problem being my whole life? I feel like I’m not even my own person; I was born for other people’s satisfaction and pleasure. Everyone just treats me like a dumb sack of meat, which I guess I am in a way.

Edit: thank you to everyone that has commented, a few of youse have actually given me some sort of hope. I’m seeing my therapist in an hour and I’m going to tell her about my thoughts getting worse, I don’t think I’ll get the help I need though. "

"I always say I won’t take my life as long as my mom’s alive but these days it feels like they’d be pretty okay without me too. I’m hoping things are better at the end of the year but if not, I don’t think I wanna see 2025 anymore. 
I’m too tired."
"My husband of 20 years wants a girlfriend and I told him he can and it’s alright. I’ve been in bed since and I really just want to die. I loved him with everything I had and now I feel like such an idiot. I shared my entire life with him. I’d feel like even more of an idiot if anyone found out I killed myself over a boy but I’m horribly lonely and feel completely abandoned. I wouldn’t be around to feel embarrassed 

Edit: to answer some questions, he has a girlfriend in mind. He met her on work trips. She lives across on opposite coast from us (USA) she asked him out according to him. I am completely financially dependent and have no savings, only debt, a car loan, student loans, credit card bills. I think my plan is to get a job and get to a place where I could leave. Reassess from there. I’d feel more confident if I didn’t need him so much. He can have his fucking side relationship but I’m my new hobby is going to be myself. I know it’s not as healthy as ending things immediately but I can’t afford it. Thank you everyone, your kind words mean so much to me "
"You act concerned and considerate and it’s all a fucking act. It doesn’t matter if I come in here screaming that my life has been nothing but neglect and abuse and that I’m on nine antidepressants and slowly losing my damn mind. I just want to bash your fucking faces into the wall for how fake you all are. It doesn’t matter if I rent a wood chipper and jump headfirst and turn myself into toothpaste. You’ll run to this post and say you care, and then tomorrow you’ll just move on and forget about me. BECAUSE YOU DON’T ACTUALLY CARE."
"My death is imminent, I took two strong antidepressants and drunk half a litre of vodka, I found of method of suicide that's quite atypical. I'm going to cover my face with a thick jacket. When I cover my face with it, I run out of air. My breathing is already short, so when I cover my face with this jacket it will be the end. 

Idk how to begin my story, but I guess I should say that I love life, or better yet, I loved life. I loved one that was fulfilling, I went to casinos, I did cocaine, I drank until I past out on the spot. I've met so many people in my life; you couldn't imagine the amount of stories I've heard, seen, and felt. 

I came to the realisation that life, life is boring. There is no point to any of this. I came to the realisation that the point of life, is finding a point. There is no point, it's simply how bad you try to delude yourself that there is a point.

I'm going to end it all very soon so I dont mind saying my reasoning.

I hope reincarnation is real

When I tried it last time, there was buzzing that wouldn't leave me, but I tried pushing past that point. My whole idea or principle if you will, is that, if there is a higher power, and I end up in a long line, waiting to drink meng POS soup, then I've won. If I haven't, then I've also won, this is the end; even if I was wrong, I will still be ""alive', my body will be returned to the earth and the nutrients my ashes or body provides will supplement new life. In essence, I never really died.

You can think of the grass near my grave as me. I don't wish for a funeral but atleast give place my ashes beneath the soil. I don't want to be lying in an irn jn your living room. 

I love my family but spent too much time in my life being lazy, I read too many fantasy novels, and later on I dreamed too many dreams that couldn't exist within this realm.

My belief is that this isnt the end. My belief, is that once I pass out, I will be reborn and underworld and I will suffer for my sins, after suffering and serving my sentence, I will be given the choice to either drink meng Po's soup, or erase my memories. I will drink the soup and live the life that samsara has granted me




I have about 20 minute untill I cover my face, so if u wanna talk, I can just about type but I might use voice recording, I can reply. If I port an update, it means I've been unsuccessful, if don't, then it means I haven't. Ask me any questions in the mean time"
"Over the past few days I’ve done whatever I can to possibly kms. First I cut my legs from foot to cooch. Second, I had three full bottles of over the counter medication. Third, I ate a quarter pound of raw meat. Fourth, I drank half a liter of bleach. Now, I’ve drank a liter of mouthwash. And somehow I’m still not dead. 

P.S. The reason why I put this on Reddit is because I wanted someone to acknowledge my faults, and I’m mortified to tell a friend."
"I have a 100 bottle of extra strength tylenol, a 100 tablet of 200mg ibuprofen, ~20 duel pain relievers mixed with tylenol and ibuprofen, and about 10 antibiotics. I just got back from the store with my favorite snacks. I have a can of margarita 10%. I just tried to call the people in my suicide note but i didn't get an answer. I guess this is it. I just went to the store and got a razor blade, but i punked out of using it. I guess if I get in too much pain i'll use it. This may be painful and I may start to stroke and seize, but fuck it. I always thought I would live till 56 (lots of diseases run in the family Im just being realistic), but I guess 21 is best. The last thing I have is my looks, so I guess I'll leave a beautiful corpse

Guy's i didn't go through with it. when i posted this i had the pills and liquor open and was crying between the putting the pills in my hand and actually putting them in my mouth. i tried this before on a lessor scale and ended up violently sick in the hospital. This was way harder than doing it before, i was almost having flashbacks. I got the pills in my mouth then got scared and went back to google to see if i knew how much it took before the seizures start, if they were painful, and the likelihood of slipping into a coma. i then looked up the most successful suicide attempts and pills were ranked at the lowest. then i started reading your comments about how it wouldn't kill me but make me violently sick. i have a very high pain tolerance but the last overdose was my first 10 pain until i caught covid. I did chicken out. I'm sorry if I wasted your time and energy worrying about me. I also want you to know this isn't ragebait, this did happen and I didn't see how much attention this got as my alt page with the notifications disabled. Sorry again"

I’m killing myself the moment I get kicked out and I know that it’s coming up soon. every other method is iffy but jumping in the middle of the night can’t be stopped.

i dont even know why im posting this. i wrote my note and set my id to the side. my dog is in his kennel and i already know who’s gonna be taking care of him. this is so long overdue. im just scared of what happens next. i hope im met with some friends on the other side. scared but ready

They say God will help. He never did. There is no Heaven nor Hell.  No God, no Satan. There is only nothing  after you die. I've seen it after a heart attack in 2018. Just nothing after death. 

No life after death.

u can’t talk to ur friends and family bc it upsets them and it’s also depressing. u can’t tell ur therapist or ur locked up. and then ppl wonder why suicide rates are up. ive struggled with suicidal ideation my entire life and it is so frustrating sometimes bc ur only option is to rlly just ride it out. 
"after 21 years of being abused and r*ped and starved and neglected and torn apart, i finally met the love of my life. my sweet darling boyfriend. i didn’t think i deserved love or someone who cared about me. i have loved him since the day i met him. i have planned every single thing in my life around him and our future. he didn’t save me from wanting to die but he gave me something to look forward to when i woke up. i was brave and strong and moved out of my abusive household. a place for him and i to stay and build and create. the first night he stayed with me. he left me. i never saw it coming. i am reduced to nothing again, and now i am alone in this fucking house, my mom had a heart attack two nights ago, and i can’t stand it all. i have no friends. no family. no ambition. he was all i had. he said i feel too much and he doesn’t understand me and he felt unloved. i am going to kill myself soon, i have set in stone plans but i don’t want him to suspect it. i have made up my mind. he was the last good thing i had. this pain is absolutely unbearable and i would never wish it on anyone. i just want him to come back to me. i had plans to marry him. i can not go on like this. why does the universe kick us when we are already down? the one person i loved, gone. just like that. what did i do to deserve it this. it doesn’t matter. before the end of april i will be dead. if he ever reads this, i love you matthew and i am sorry i could not save us. i always told you my love for you will exist even after i am gone and i will find you in any universe. i love you i love you i love you."
"Hear me out. 

I can understand why people commit suicide. And I think it’s selfish for loved ones of those who did commit to call them selfish for “leaving them”. No. 

A person suffering from severe mental health conditions that cause them to be suicidal - they can do all the work to get better. They can go to therapy, they can take their medication, they can go to the gym and eat healthy, they can work and save money, they can be social and see their friends and family every other day, they can study for a degree they really want… but once those feelings of depression, and loneliness and isolation and emptiness come back for them, it’s so easy to forget the good things you have in your life (I.e. a loving family, a good job, a good gym routine, whatever it is).

But to expect your loved one who has committed suicide to continue living in this vicious cycle of being well and then unwell (whether it’s because of trauma, a diagnosed disorder, a chemical imbalance, etc) - THAT is selfish. Because unless they also suffer from mental health issues that cause suicidal thoughts and ideation, they will never understand the severity of their condition. They will never understand why they want to die despite all the good things they have in their life. 

So for someone who has been successful in their suicide attempt, I can totally understand why they did it. Even if it’s someone who isn’t doing the work to get better (I.e. no therapy, no meds - just straight rawdogging), I can still understand why they want to die and commit suicide, or why they committed suicide.

I am not at all saying that you should go about committing suicide. I think everyone’s life is important and can be meaningful despite their mental health issues. HOWEVER, if they do feel this way and do try or do end up killing themselves, I would never call them selfish for it because I understand why they would do, or did what they did.

Hi so When I was 13 we had 2 family friends luckily they aren't involved anymore. As you can probably tell the 2 events were each done by one of them I don't know I just.. it really hurts and it makes me want to kms... I wish I could just forget..
"Idk what to do i can’t take it anymore there’s so many pretty girls that look PERFECT like legit perfect and its not fair 
Why do i have to be so fucking ugly 
If i was pretty I wouldn’t be suicidal 
It hurts so bad when i see them i feel like I shouldn’t even breathe a disgusting creature like me isn’t allowed to even breathe around attractive people i really should just kms
And its funny (this is actually very sad) that the only moment where i can feel pretty for a second is when i see extremely obese people or people that had accidents that made their faces deformed thats probably the only way for me to feel pretty for a moment 
I know i sound extremely shallow and like a piece of shit 
And that’s another reason why i should kms because i am shallow and disgusting piece of shit i have disgusting mindset because looks are everything for me and i feel like I don’t really care about people who I don’t find attractive my attention always goes for attractive people but I can’t help it and it makes me absolutely disgusting and a shitty person and i know that most people are the same way as me but i feel like I’m not even allowed to have standards because how ugly and worthless i am 
But i do have standards and all i care about is being pretty and finding attractive bf 
And im a hypocrite because i feel mad at society because of pretty privilege meanwhile i am not any better because I literally will be happy just seeing attractive man and attractive man always catch my attention and i kinda ignore the unattractive ones.. (i never treat them like shit tho)
I know im sick and twisted 
But life is so unfair 
There’s really nothing in this world that would make me happy like being pretty would.. "
"Im 15m, I was walking back to my house from a friends house I stopped at a bathroom at a park when a guy came up started grabbing me then raped me I haven’t been able to get out of bed I just want to die I feel horrible and sick.

"I'm a 35 y/o male from the UK. I've had two unsuccessful attempts in the past but I feel strongly that I need to try again

I've had two ""intimate"" experiences in my life and they both left me with trauma. My first experience was at 16 and my last experience was when I was 22.

The first one was during the only relationship I ever had. We were both 16 and she really wanted us to share our first time together, but she lost interest in me when she saw me naked. She then cheated on me and told all her friends about me, before dumping me.

It took me a long time to get over that and at 22 I went on a date with a woman in her late 30s. The date went really well and she invited me back to hers, but when she saw my penis she said ""that's a little..um..small..."" at which point I froze for a minute and then left

I haven't tried to meet anyone after that and I'm terrified at the prospect of dating &amp; I have a phobia of intimacy that I'll likely never get over. I can't face being humiliated again.  On social media it's ""small dick energy"" this and ""big dick energy"" that.. I'm constantly reminded that I'm a low value person because of my body and I can't live this way.

 I try to carry on and live my empty life the best I can, but I can't take the loneliness anymore. I'm done living with the shame of being such an abomination. I need to go."
"It was sudden. She was gone in 24 hrs. 17 years of life together gone in an instant.

We have a toddler and a 1 year old.

No one has yet to give me a compelling reason to stay.

We worked so hard for our lives. It was perfect.

Why should I settle for less?

I don't want to be here without her. No one can make me stay.

"I get used by every guy I know like I’m disposable. And when I finally feel like I’ve met someone who actually cares for me, who sees my struggle, they just told me that they only want me as a fuck buddy, I want to die, I fell for this asshole, why would he act so sweet and understanding and then just leave me to rot?
I’m tired of people just looking to have “fun” or casual sex, when I really really fucking don’t. It pains me to not be able to enjoy casual sex like others, it pains me to get attached, it pains me so much to miss him this much when I meant NOTHING to him. I’m on the verge of hurting myself again, its been 5 years without self harm but i cant take it anymore.

UPDATE: he says he wants to still be friends… even without sex, but why? I dont understand why cant he just give me a chance? Plus, If I stay as his friend then someday he’ll find another fuckbuddy and I’ll just feel jealous and small… why would he want that???"
"This world is ugly and life is unbearable. I want to show people to what point this life messed me up. I take back my life in my hands by doing this and I'm happy about it. If people want to stop me then this world has to change but since I know it won't happen then, goodbye everyone"
"I wrote a note. I packed a bag with pills and water. I don’t want to leave. I know if I leave I’m not coming back home. Im scared. 

I know it sounds stupid but can someone just tell me not to leave the house? Like we don’t even have to talk or anything. I just want to feel like one soul on this earth is actually making the choice for me and telling me to stay. So I can cop out. Please. I want someone to take the blame for being the reason I stay home instead. 

I’m like a fucking damsel in distress and I can’t make my own fucking choices. I just need a cop out. 

Edit: I am staying home and going to bed. You’re all so sweet holy shit, I didn’t think anyone would respond to this… I am safe and I’ll update you all in the morning when I wake up. I am beyond grateful for every single comment I got. I cannot stress that I really was about to go, but I didn’t. You’re all very good people. I feel shitty for having taken up your time, but also so grateful that people cared. Thank you so much. 

Edit2: omg guys. I feel so loved. I don’t know what happened last night, I just sorta got weak I guess. I’m not usually THAT bad. I mean, I have depression and everything, but it’s usually manageable. You all helped so much. I feel like absolute shit for having wasted everyone’s time like this, but also I know a bunch of you are telling me I didn’t waste anyone’s time… idk, I’m just confused. I’m still tired, but not as sleepy. It’s 10:45 here, I woke up a little while ago but just sorta laid in bed for a few hours. Nights are significantly harder than daytime, so I feel better now. 

Thank you all for the love you showed, my inbox is absolutely overflowing. I wanna respond to everyone… I feel like you’re all my friends checking in on me. I know we’re strangers, but having notifications is just strange for me. I’m not used to it at all. I don’t have a lot of friends. Or any, really, besides my siblings. So thank you all for being there. It genuinely means everything to me. "
"25F. 

7 years ago, I was trafficked into the adult industry. I was fresh out of high school, had no money for college, came from poverty, and they got me in at the right time. 

It was basically a similar situation to what happened with the victims of the “Girls Do Porn”. It only lasted 4 months. 

I was put through so much. Humiliation, rape, complete dehumanization. 

And when I left and went back to my hometown, it was just as bad. I was treated with so much disgust and shame. I have been repeatedly harassed by men for these past 7 years. I no longer show my face in my hometown. My social media is all private and hidden. 

I have a nice life now and a wonderful partner who knows but doesn’t care. We just bought a house and are getting married next year. I know he tells me he doesn’t care and understands what I went through, but I still feel like there’s thoughts in his mind of how gross I am. 

I still want to kill myself. 

I don’t deserve any of this. My fiancé was a virgin when we met a year ago. I am an ex whore. Even before sex trafficking, I had a past of being hypersexual and addiction. I am a victim of child sex abuse. I was groomed by a serial pedophile at 13, and when I was really young, my drunk father would show me pornography. 

I feel so broken and used. I feel “ran through”, like a “car with too many miles”. 

I am nothing like that anymore. I’m almost the complete opposite. And yet I still have to live with the shame because it’s out there. There’s videos. As long as those websites exist, I will never be free. 

I am planning on killing myself sometime soon. I don’t want to hurt anybody anymore, but I am in so much pain and have to much guilt. I can’t live with what I’ve done. I just want to be free of it all. And my partner, family, friends…they don’t deserve someone as disgusting as me in their lives. They deserve better.

"Does anyone else ever feel like they just don't care? Don't care about living. Don't care about dying. Just here.

I don't really know how to explain what I'm feeling.  I just feel like I've come to a point where I've experienced enough pain that I'm numb to this life. I don't want to be alive, but I don't want to die. I don't know what comes after this. It could be worse than this hell. 

I consider ending my life but then I think about the aforementioned.  

I don't care about my job. I don't care if I lose it. I don't care if I don't survive.  This reality has drained me of the person I used to be. I used to like helping people. I used to like hanging out with friends. Now all I feel is pain. Every second of every day.  

This hellhole did this to me. I wish I never existed.  Existence is a curse for so many people in this place. Why is this place like this?

I don't know what to do. I am crying as I'm typing this. 

I hate feeling like this. "
"yesterday i was walking to get lunch and a woman yelled at me, in front of everyone else on the street, and called me an ugly bitch. when i turned around to look at her, she said “yeah you, you fucking ugly ass bitch”. i already have severe body dysmorphic disorder, so i hate the way i look. so what she said completely broke me. it shattered the last bit of confidence that i have. what she said just confirmed everything in my head, and i am heartbroken. this feels like my final straw, it’s enough that i tell myself i’m ugly everyday, but for a complete stranger to do it? i feel awful. any help is appreciated.

"I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it.

  
Why do I have to be in this body? I don't even have gender dysphoria. I just hate how I don't matter and have never received an ounce of empathy or care by anyone in my entire life other than my mother. I'm judged for everything that I do. I can't take it anymore"
"so when i was maybe 7-8 i got exposed to sex, by watching/playing GTA5. obviously that game isn’t suitable for people at that age. i also had two friends who were the same age as me and we discussed the game a lot and that’s how i got into the idea of sex

one day when i was 9 i got curious as to how that felt and i brought my sister to a room and tried to bring my sister to the room who was just 1 at the time. i asked her to put in her mouth and she kept saying no so i got off and left. i didn’t have any evil intent, it was just curiosity (i’m not justifying what i did i’m just explaining). i didn’t know what things like rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment and things like that were. i didn’t understand the magnitude of what i tried to do

i kind of forgot about the situation until i was 14, and i lived with the guilt of the situation for several months and considered killing myself by drinking the kind of bleach you’d use to clean your bathroom. even tho i was never officially diagnosed, i’d consider myself to be depressed at the time. i told my mom about it and she basically forgave me and kept it a secret

i’m 18 now, and 2 days ago i got into an argument with my sister and mom and she randomly threatened to tell my sister about what happened. i don’t think about the incident anymore because i forgave myself but now she’s making me relive the situation and guilt i felt when i was 14 and i want to die again

It’s just crazy to me that there are people who live day to day happy as ever and it never crosses their mind to end it all . I feel crazy lmfao
"Unfortunately this is not a joke. I feel like I want to got out at the hands of somebody I love. I’m not even sure if I want it gradual(meaning a period of physical abuse before he kills me) or instant(one day he just snaps and kills). I know this is inappropriate but I don’t having anyone in my life to talk about this to including a therapist. I’ve had scenarios of how he’d kill me but I haven’t been able to imagine how he’d look like. I’m ready to die but would rather have somebody else take my life for me. I wouldn’t want him to be charged for my murder either because it was something I wanted anyways.

"I am a severely unattractive person. It hurts me so much to live with this face. Seeing myself in the mirror or photos kills my self-confidence. I do not only have to deal with the dread of seeing my own horrifying reflection, but also the treatment that I receive from others. I have had people move places when I sat next to them. When I talk to people they have this look in their eyes that signals disgust. I have been made fun in front of my face on several occasions. I have been told I am ugly both online and in real life. 

It’s not an issue of weight. I have a healthy and normal body weight. I dress well. I keep my hygiene. The issue is my face. I have facial features and a facial structure that can not be improved through plastic surgery. 

I get so jealous of women my age. I keep constantly seeing beautiful women all around me. They have everything I don’t. I feel like an ogre next to them. 

I hate writing this as it makes me feel weak. I want to be able to deal with my emotions without having to spew them out to strangers online. But I feel that I can’t take this anymore. I have been thinking of committing suicide a lot lately. I am scared of death, but I also do not want to continue my life. "
"2 days ago i attempted…

i cut my wrists, and as i was passing out, my boyfriend came to the bathroom. he saw me laying there, and told me he was taking me to the hospital. 

we get to the hospital and they give me pain meds, so i was out of it, but i had to get multiple stitches, and wrists bandages. 

i was put on a 48 hr psych hold and did a psych evaluation, but was released after. this was because of (1-my behavior.) (2-i told them i no longer had SI.) and (3- i was in a clear state of mind in that moment.) 

needless to say, i regretted it as soon as i did it!! suicide is not the answer, and i learned that the hard way. i attempted and regretted it, meaning i have something in me that wants to live. and some part of me that has just a little bit of hope. 

keep your head up, because it’s NOT the answer "

I’m honestly more sad about the fact in a couple weeks they’ll probably feel guilty about it, but it’s not really their fault because they didn’t know it was their last chance to see me.

I’m so mad at myself for trying to set this up. I should have known they wouldn’t want to come, because they don’t invite me when they hangout. I try not to bother people but I just wanted a little closer, I mean we were friends ever since we were little girls. I think we were all 3/4 when our moms became friends.

"Reverse psychology. I know, genius. Either way, if this gets ignored, I'm proven right, if it doesn't, i have some entertainment when i wake up. What do you want to read? A sad story? I don't have one, I had a bunch of insecurities, parents made me self conscious about my weight and sensitivity. Felt like I was a throwaway friend that my friends barely value, all of that at 7 years old. Does that count? No? fine. How about some relatable words? Like... How I'm constantly tired all day and have no motivation to do anything? Cliche? fine. I guess you can leave. What's the point? Going into this subreddit, frolicking through the aisles of people who have it rougher than me, deciding to post to get my oh so special thoughts out there... Nothing better than seeing a big fat zero on the comment count to force myself down the gullet of despair and hopelessness once again. My attempts are laughable Are you cringing yet? Is anyone even there? Hello? I imagine i wake up and see no one commenting on this post, and realizing all these thoughts eventually fall flat. All for nothing. I hate myself for even trying."

"I don’t want to be gay. 
I began watching porn at like 10 years old, and it quickly devolved into sissy porn. its something i never questioned in my formative years, because i would watch it habitually and then go to school and be attracted and infatuated with women. 
sometimes 4 or 5 times a day id use it. 
I was sent to a rehab from 17-18 where i lived in a home with 12 boys the same age some being gay, and never even thought about it. id be imagining the girls that were separated from us next door. 
when i got out i used straight porn normally, one day i decided to dip my toe back into the grueling shit that was this sick kind of pornography that told me i was a weaker man.
i remember one day my post orgasm regret was different, and i told myself in my head “oh that one changed me” 
and then i stopped for a long while. 
im 23 now 
and 6 months ago i was happy with my girlfriend lying in bed when this wave of horrible feeling washed over me and i felt like nothing was right. i started to question everything about myself. 
i started to question whether or not i was gay, and id try to come to terms with it then start to cry because it isn’t what I want. I don’t fucking want to be. 
ive been trying to come to terms with the idea but i can’t. I just want my gf back. shes since broken up with me because i told her i might be bi. 
I can’t handle it. I find this shit arousing still. i still have to check obsessively to see if thats what arouses me and when it does i get fucking destroyed inside.

"Originally posted on r/depression but nobody gives a shit about me so I got no responses


I regularly fantasize about my suicide.
I often find myself fantasizing about my suicide. Not just occasionally, but daily, hell sometimes hourly. I almost went through with it one time but I stopped myself, I’m not sure why. For some reason it’s comforting to imagine myself hanging from a rope, or diving in front of a train. I am a musician, and a dream of mine is to kill myself onstage at a live show. Is this weird? Has anybody else ever thought like this? I enjoy my own misery sometime as well, I’m completely backwards"
"Well I sliced my arm up. Deep too. I ended up writing goodbyes to Reddit servers as I was just ready to die. But while I was unconscious somebody saw blood near the door and decided to call 911 which was…surprisingly fast to get there. I’m in the hospital now where I’m going to reside for the next couple of days. My arm hurts and it’s cold here. Feels nice though. 


Even though you guys are all strangers on the internet it’s you guys are humans who have lives ahead of them. good to have you guys here. I love you all &lt;3"
"

Throw away. I don't know. I'm in my early twenties, ive been in denial since i was 8 and I've just recently decided ""it is what it is i need help, this is what i am"". But i cant find help.

All i find is ""you can modify the thoughts"". No. I want to kill myself if so. I don't want to modify these sexual thoughts. I don't want modify it. I want it gone. I want to kill myself everyday because of it. I hate being around animals now, i was going to work at a zoo with animals in a program. I was going to college because i do love animals, but my paraphillia has made me so uncomfortable i just. I don't know what to do. I refuse to let my online career do anything because i know i will hurt followers if they find out what i am. I dont want to hurt anyone. I just want to be a normal person like you. 

I wish there was people i could talk too. I want therapy. I want medicine. I want my brain to be erased. I want to be a good person again. I want to die so badly its all i want to ask for from people now. Let me be euthanized. All people ever say is ""kill zoophiles"", ""youre disgusting"" and ""if you have those thoughts you WILL act upon it"". I don't want too? I feel disgusted with the idea of doing it because its rape. I don't want to rape an animal. Ive never almost done it or had a plan because i know rape is disgusting.

Im at such an ends I can't find any therapy for this I just want help please for the love of god save me. 



Edit: please stop saying its ocd. For the love of god it is not it is a genuine sexual attraction to animals

Edit 2: i am in therapy for anxiety and ocd diagnosis already. And i am terrified of telling him about it since ive just started sessions. 

Edit 3: for the love of god stop messaging me on how to drug and rape dogs?? I'm about to delete this account later today because of it it's making me feel worse "

It’s been a stressful week my husband went to the hospital because of a car accident and he still haven’t woke up. I stayed with him in the hospital for 2 days and when i got back home i found my daughter passed out with an empty paracetamol 1g bottle beside her. She took 12 pills which is 12g of paracetamol. I took her to the hospital and now she’s in coma. She already suffers from a heart disease so i don’t think she will make it. I opened her phone to check why did she do that and i found on her note app a text she wrote to her boyfriend of three years. He told her that he cheated on her through the relationship and he thought the best time to tell her is while her dad is in the hospital and she was already stressed. She had a panic attack and overdosed and had low oxygen level which resulted for her to be in coma and she might suffer from liver damage and it can be fatal. Here’s my question what am i supposed to do? Should i text him ? Should i text his parents? Is there anything i can do about it to make him pay for what he did ? Please help
"I am a 21 year-old male and I have been struggling with zoophilic fantasies for about a year now. I have never harmed an animal nor touched them inappropriately. I realize that animals can not consent and I feel very disgusted with myself because of these fantasies.

I think what triggered it all was a combination of being exposed to zoo porn as a child and being sexually harassed in a bar about a year ago. As I understand (take this with a grain of salt, I'm not a therapist) my brain tries to protect itself by creating a sexual scenario where I am completely in control over something defenseless.

I have tried to deal with this myself but even if I managed to not give in to these fantasies for some time, eventually I'd have a day where I would indulge in them, whether just fantasizing or watching porn. I have managed to cut out real zoo porn but that's about it. I feel miserable because of this. I would never hurt an animal but I'm afraid I won't ever be rid of these wishes and I just can't bear with this for much longer. I started self-harming because of it. I often have suicidal thoughts and almost attempted once.

I would prefer therapy to suicide but I'm not sure how to approach a therapist about this and I'm very afraid of being reported as some sex offender. Not because it'll be bad for me but because then my family would know. I don't see a way to continue living if that happens.

Please help, I'll take any advice you can give"
"i didnt even ask to be born, so why the fuck was i born this way? it’s so unfair. i feel cursed. my mom doesn’t accept or support me, my whole evangelical family would never support me, even if they did, i would just never be really happy. i’ll always have to suffer with transphobia, i will never be seen as a girl by society, i’ll never be as feminine as i want. i feel like i wasnt even supposed to be born. the only thing stopping me from killing myself right now is the fact that my grave will always have my deadname. i see no future for me in this life."
"They found me unresponsive, cold, and in a pool of my own vomit. I'm mad at the person who called the ambulance and I feel resentment towards them. The doctor says I should be grateful that I got another chance, but I'm not. I feel disappointed and that I'm a failure. I'm covered in bruises and I am in pain. Now they're trying to convince me to date, get a roommate, or get a pet so that I'm not alone. But I don't want any of those things. This was three days ago. I hate it and I'll most probably do it again, but this time with a more foolproof plan."
"No matter how much I try to change my body or my voice I will always end up looking like a masculine ogre monstrosity. It only takes going outside for a few seconds to know how pointless it is, women don't look like that, they don't have shoulders like mine, hips like mine, they don't sound like that, and they don't have a penis. it is clear as day that I am a man. Hormones just feel like a cope at this point I'll never be a  real women, I started too late, my body is irreversibly ruined and disfigured by testosterone. When I see my revolting masculine face in the mirror i want to barf I feel like I'm in a flesh prison with no way out I want to bash my stupid fucking face until my head goes numb. If I had taken hormones blockers before 19, I wouldn't be so repugnant. It will never get better. I should have never known I was trans, now I can't go back. I was born a abomination and it would be better for everyone if I wasn't here."
"It's the only way they would ever know something was wrong with me. It gives me a kind of sick happiness to imagine their reaction, what they would make of the news and maybe even feeling sorry for me. It sounds sick in my head and I hate it. But I love to just imagine the scenario and how it would play out.

God I fucking hate myself."
I am 23 male who has PSSD (if you haven’t heard about it look it up) I’m also bisexual and I just met up with a random stranger. I was giving him oral but he was recording me. I want to kms so bad. I caught him and told him to fuck off and delete it. I left now I feel like a worthless piece of shit. Going to get tested at my primary care in a hour. 
"28 years I’ve been stuck on this miserable pile of shit. Blown thousands of dollars talking to idiot assholes who just waterboard me with metaphors about how beautiful life is, and it’s beautiful to these fuckers because THEY ARENT ME! Everything Ive tried brings no relief at all to this goddamn curse. I told my therapist to fuck off and flushed my pills down the toilet because I’m fucking done with everything. And if you say it gets better, you can go fuck yourself with a railroad spike covered in acid because you don’t even know if that’s true. So fuck you and everyone else who thinks it helps."
"I (m35) was diagnosed with lung cancer in May after weeks of coughing blood and finally gave in and went to the Dr's office. They did the normal routine and standard procedure for the sort of thing x rays and bloodwork. I'm in a hurry to get back to work. I left before they could give me results. Two hours later They asked me to go to ohsu in portland. Nervous about what this could went By myself regrettably, And let them take biopsy samples of my lungs. In record time, they told me that I have stage four lung cancer.  Right then and there, what's the hardest blow I've ever felt. I cry uncontrolably for  the entire drive back home. I pulled over twice to yell as loud as i could. I can only imagine what others were thinking on the highway. I make it home to tell my wife (26f).  I sit her down hand in hand as she's asking me what's wrong. I explained everything the dr said, not asking for anything, just explaining what my prognosis is.  And she immediately pulled her hands back and with a blank look on her the face. she had to pulled her handsn back andbsaid I not going to do this.  i'm not gonna be a part of any of this. I can't be your wife. I can't be married to a cancer patient. Im not her to be a maid. I can't be your nurse. I can't be your chauffeur. I can't do the hospice thing. I'm definitely not the cook.  I'm not trying to be a housekeeper. I'm gonna live my life how I want to. I can't help you. I'm gonna let your mom know what is happening so you can move back home. I still love you. And if you somehow get cancer free, come find me, ""  that devastated me.  That absolutely crushed me. She kept everything. I haven't seen my kids(3yo 4yo) in weeks. And she has made this false narrative saying i was abusive to justify her departure. The Dr's recently gave me an estimated timeline  yesterday, 1-3-23, which was also my birthday. I hope I would see my kids I she never responded to my texts begging to see the kids. Even if it's 10 minutes to please consider. And the only response i got was a""NO🤬"". Today, I felt as if the best thing for me would be to end it all. I'm struggling and don't know what I did to deserve any of this.

UPDATE. I can share screenshots with people showing how toxic she was to me. And also how very little value she put in my life



Update as of 1/13/24
I'm sorry if I took  respond to some of you. The intense exhaustion from the chemo 100% sucks. Image taking liek 5 benadryl .then having your stomach wrenching up with the worst bubble mudd gut cramps. I mean the kind where the arches of your feet are hurtin cause your stomach has been imploding from all dry heaving your doing. Follow that up with body aches that will take it right down to your bones. I'm bouncing back asbmt


Thank you. Two those of u who advised me to seek legal counsel. I appreciate Steering me in a better direction. She's been very difficult and very standoffish with allowing my mom and my dad The ability to see their grandkids. She recently Started using the words ""you could see the kids if"". Is the sslfish bullshi tone she uses when talking to my parents About them spending time together. 

 In less than a week went from  absolutely no time with my kids..  To having a hearing for us to establish my parenting time, as well as him planning on advocating for my parents time as well. One of my big concerns is if I die, my parents will never be allowed to see their grandkids. Thats notwhat I want. I want my kids to spanish much time with their grandparents as possible"
I want to die so bad. Please just kill me. 
i am actually about to throw up that account had infants and toddlers and kids and preteens and teenagers snd it’s like. fucking infants? How the fuck is this on a normal surface web platform like this I cybertipped it but I’m scared even that will do nothing. I’m fucking horrified that poor boy oh my god how do I get that out of my head
"One year ago while visiting family out of the country I was raped by a male family member in our own grandmother's house on Christmas Eve. I was barely 16. The man was probably around 30. My grandmother died a few months later. The past two months have been hell building up to the holidays and seeing everyone else happy and enjoying being with family while im stuck replaying the past over and over. Watching everyone move forward with their lives while I am the only one who cant move on. I dont even know who it was because I was drugged, just that they were an older relative. It's slowly killing me. I cant go outside, cant eat, sleep, go to the bathroom, shower, undress, without being reminded of how all my life men have violated me, the tearing pain of having your body not belong to you. I'm tired. I have a plan but I was too cowardly to fight back then and I am too cowardly to do anything to change my situation now. I don't know what to do. Even in death I will be a burden to others and that is the only reason I haven't killed myself, because it is better to live quietly as a ghost and suffer than to die and bring attention to myself and suffering to others. I hate men and I hate the holidays and I hate myself."
"Genuine question. I am autistic. I just don't understand.

My belief is that humans have an innate instinct to want other humans to survive (in a protecting the tribe sort of sense) but other than that, I can't see any logical reason why some people seem to care. It's my body, why shouldn't I die? I don't like living soooo, why not?

I feel like I'm crazy and no one could ever understand. I'm like an alien wearing human skin. The way my mind operates is so different to a normal human that the advice people give just doesn't work for me.

""You can't die, think about how your friends and family would feel!""

Okay? Sounds like their problem. why should I be concerned over how THEY feel of I am the one committing suicide???

""You have so much to live for!""

Don't really care. I have no interest in whatever measely things I could achieve.

""It's the easy way out!""

Yes, that's the point. Thank you for shaming me and invalidating my feelings."
"so I've been on Reddit for about 18 days now and the only reason I downloaded it was to get help from strangers it did kind of hel

unfortunately even with the helpnof these generous strangers ive reached my end 

i am grateful for everything and everyone in my life thus far. even if they know it or dont. this was a very hard decision to make but im thankful that im taking that big step now. 

wish i was better with words honestly. the shit that is going on in my head is too much for me to bear and i think enough is enough. 

im going to give my family some grace and bot shoot myself inside the house but near the fields where i live. 

ill miss my mom so much. shes an amazing and talented woman ruined by my dad. 

hes a pathetic and a narcissistic piece of shit. he should be in jail tbh. 

i can't believe im going to hurt my mom like this and i feel horrible but i see suicide as a selfless act than a selfish one. 

my mom and my brother my two favorite people im very sorry

im beyond exhausted and tired with everything 

ill be dead hopefully by 2 or 3 am. 

it feels bittersweet leaving finally. now funny enough i dont wanna go. 

but at the same time i know i need to go. theres nothing much i can do anymore. 

it was a good life 

im scared.

"As the title says, I survived a suicide attempt on Monday. I got whisked away to the hospital in an ambulance. 

In the ambulance, I started to hallucinate. I could see rainbow smoke, hear a woman singing random words into my left ear and I could literally feel my soul leaving my body. 

It’s the fact that I could feel my soul leaving my body- that’s what’s unsettling me. What if I actually crashed and died in that ambulance? 

Could I be dead and just don’t know it? I’m so worried that I actually did die and I’ve left my family members behind. I’m terrified that my poor mother is grieving my loss. 

My method has a high fatality rate, and even if I were to survive, I shouldn’t have walked away unscathed. It’s freaking me out that not only did I survive, but there’s virtually no physical consequences. It only furthers my suspicions. 

I’ve been barely able to eat since this incident. I’m so anxious and genuinely traumatised from this. 

I absolutely regret what I did and I really wish I could go back in time and save myself from myself. "
"A 25 year old woman walked into traffic on the highway and I saw her die

I was right there in the passenger seat when I saw her walk in and be struck

The two other people in the car with me were screaming and crying

I wonder how the 2-3 drivers that hit her feel

Seeing this made me think of my own mortality all over again

Recently I hadn't really thought about suicide or self harm because my boyfriend was there to distract me from those thoughts

I'll be honest, I envied that woman

"I'm so done with this world. My parents are so fucked up. My dad is a narcissist. My mom is a manipulator. My older sister is practically living with her bf. I never see my older brother. And my other older brother is a abusive rude person. My life is a shit show. I'm depressed and full with anxiety. I'm not making it to 2024 if its the last thing I do... Literally. I'm not scared of death anymore not after my many close encounters. I've almost died 7 times. I dont care if it hurts my family because I won't be here to watch the be sad yk. I have the pills under my pillows. I might go out and smoke weed or smoke a cig Idk tbh but ig this is my good bye to this fucked up world. I might not do it or I might make it out alive.

edit: please go look at my new post for new info"
"TW: I used to do stupid things as a teenager. Every day acting like a fool in my vehicle but that immediately ended when I was 17.

I was in a wreck where I rolled multiple times. After the rolling stopped, I couldn't move or breathe. I passed out shortly after that.

My friend pulled me out and started CPR until the paramedics arrived. I was pronounced dead at the scene. My heart was restarted by the paramedics on a way to the hospital. During my body's recovery, I died 3 more times.

That accident changed my life forever. I broke my neck and I am now paralyzed from the neck down (I am a quadriplegic.) I had my ENTIRE FUTURE PLANNED, but one stupid decision turned those plans to smoke.

Driving recklessly is NOT WORTH THE RISK. Despite how you feel, YOU ARE NOT INVINCIBLE. One small misstep can be the end of you as it nearly was mine.

Also before any of you ask how I was able to type all of this, I use quadjoy mouse and onscreen keyboard."
"I think I’m one of those people. The kind of people that doesn’t fit in anywhere. Not even in the weird kid kind of way. The kind of people who don’t know what to do with their life and no matter what they try to pursue because they grow tired of everything. They can’t hold down schooling or a career which is a horrible thing because you need money. They can’t imagine themselves doing anything or their life going anywhere. I’ll end up rotting away at this rate. I feel like it’s a mistake me being here and I have to correct that mistake. 

Edit: I didn’t really expect this to blow up. Some backstory, I’m from Southeast Asia. Not a Chinese spy.. as some have put it. So the Asian pressure is there, I guess. Not that I ever lived up to the  smart Asian stereotype. I’m rather dumb honestly, haha. At my school, I’m number 300 something out of like 355 students in terms of grades. I don’t do very well in school and I have a hard time remembering and understanding things. I’m not very talented. I can’t bring myself to dedicate myself to anything. All I do is daydream, sleep, and binge eat. Being surrounded by so many great people and faced with the prospect of not getting into any college, I don’t think I want to continue living anymore. I will always see myself as a failure. I don’t care enough to try. I don’t want to face reality. Everyday, I wake up screaming because I’m still alive. All my life, I never really cared about anything. Even now, all I know is to distract myself with meaningless things so I don’t feel an impending doom. 

All I feel is jealousy and self hatred and fear. I don’t care about getting help. It’s embarrassing. Being an only child and having all this money invested into me only to turn out like this.. and on top of that, having to spend money on medicine and a therapist because I came out of the womb a fucked up failure? Meanwhile all my friends are off doing things that matter and building their future? No, I have too much pride to let my exterior show just how awful I am inside. I don’t like anything about me. I have no desire to live. I’m not engineered to function in this world and I accept that. I hate seeing all these horrible things happening in the world and it already feels like the end honestly.

Everyday I hide under the covers wishing I would just croak. I feel like throwing up because of all these thoughts running through my head. I wish I could just put a gun to my head at this point. I wish I could say I had any vices other than food. I wish I could say I was drunk as I type this because I feel like it’s just a bunch of rambling and it’s not enough to convey just how much I hate myself, just how much I hate living and life in general."
" Everyone hates me simply for existing. Nothing, NOTHING goes right at all in my life. I took 6000mg of benadryl just barely and am about to smoke my last bowl and then I'm just going to go to sleep. I will never forgive myself. I never even had a true sense of self. I'm sick and tired of being told that jm selfish for feeling this way. I didn't want to come here. I didn't want this identity or this fucking horrible disease. This js the last time I will post. I don't know what else to say. I'm going to die now and nobody will notice or care."
"There is no help where I live.  If you have thoughts of suicide you better have a detailed plan and packed breakfast lunch and dinner at the local ER because it's going to be a looong ass wait.  Then they probably will talk to you in a hallway because there's no beds available.   It will be an intern or resident.   Then a doctor will come and apologize for the lack of beds available and offer a referral for the following week.  At which you then will sit and wait another hour for a consult that lasts 12 minutes and perhaps a script for effexor.  No follow up but the recommendation that you followup with your family doctor, as if you haven't been on the wait list for 3.5 years waiting for one.
Im so confused when I read about people wishing they had known their loved one needed help.  Wished they had reached out.   Why hadn't they gotten help? Because noone fucking cares and when we are struggling people say ""i hope you get the help you need"" which of which there is only enough for seemingly 2 people a week."
I wish there was a method of suicide that was 100% effective. Everything out there leaves the chance of survival and some can even leave you with life long effects if you do survive 
"I wild swim, and recently our wee community was slightly rocked when a woman within the group who suffers from MH issues swam out to sea.   No one could stop her, by the time anyone realised what she was doing she was so far out no one could stop her. She was reported as missing person, there has been a search but no body.  Assuming the sea has claimed her and she was suffering an episode at the time, I am still mildly envious of her.  The idea of doing something I love till i can’t and then that’s it, to me means I would be dieing happy.  I feel mildly envious of her.  I wish I could find a way of making my family understand that I would be dying happy by doing something similar.  "
"For almost all of those 60 years, people have repeatedly told me ""it'll get better.""  They lied and lied and lied.  Now **those same fucking people** are ignoring the lies they told me, and nstead now are telling me ""hey, this late in life, you can't expect these things to get better.  That's just the way life is.""  Which is in line with the shrink who told me that some people just don't get to be happy and that's just the way it goes.

And yet somehow something's wrong with me for complaining, for not wanting this life.  Since there's no chance of things getting better, their solution is that I'm doped up to where I just don't care anymore.  And I'm supposed to think that that's reasonable.

"So a month ago, i attemped suicide.
I cut my wrist and i almost cut my throat.
So after some days i think i died and i still think so.

Sometimes i have to remind myself that I'm actually still alive and sometimes i cut myself to prove that I'm indeed not dead.

2 weeks ago i had that ""i am dead"" thought and i almost cut myself on the bus.

"My brother died this morning 4:55am. My entire family ain’t give a shit about me, my mum sucks, I don’t have any friends and my life is complete shit. The only thing keeping me going is that if I died, my brother would be sad but since he’s gone out of this world I guess that dosen’t matter. I’ve wrote a note I’m going to leave on my microwave. It was really strange seeing the sun go down one last time knowing I’ll never see it again.

I’m going to sneak out around 1am give or take an hour and walk roughly 8 minutes (according to google maps)  to an area me and my brother used to go to together and hang myself. 

I feel so good and borderline happy that this shit is all over.

Here’s my note, is there anything I can change?

To my family

I’ll be seeing [insert brothers name] soon so it’s ok.

I encourage you to not be sad about my death, as it’s what I want.

Im sorry for doing this everyone, I hope you can forgive me

I love you all

Yeah yeah, I know they don’t give a shit about me but who gives a fuck it’s my note I guess.

Edit: I chickened out, there were people at the area."
"It's weird. Because i feel so free, ive been so hurt for so many years, especially recently. but now knowing i have everything set up, i have everything i have that i want to say to everyone written down, i feel like i can finally breathe after years of suffocation. I havent told anyone, and im not going to other than this i guess. but ive ruined multiple lives, i only hurt those that i love and there is and hasnt been a future for me. my brother has always looked down on me, my mom only ever makes me feel like a burden, (  and to be fair no fault on her, i am a mess and always have been and will likely not be getting better) my ex and i are on probation because of me, she doesnt want me anymore, constantly lies to me now and refuses to let me in or have patience so we can try, and i dont blame her, ive hurt her constantly too. the only reason tragedy here in my opinion is my son. not my blood kid, but kind of a step son, ive been there from the day of his birth and i never saw myself as the father type and never wanted it, but being with him mostly everyday has made me fall in love with his silly little self. i love him so much but im not allowed to be in his life, she wont let me, and i get it. besides ive messed up too much already, but other than that, like i said i feel free, i feel like i can breathe again. i have everything set up and after tonight, im going to be finally doing it. i have 2 liters of liquor, 4 ful bottles of pills, and a 4 story high tower. and im going to drink with a friend, leave, and go climb. its beauitufl up there. ive been a few times just to see. and man... the view is great. im  honestly looking forward to this a lot. i guess my only regret is hurting her. but just like everyone else who has ever expereienced me, shes going top be better off in the longrun without me. and ive wanted to do this for years, im really tired of pushing forward for nothing. so thanks for reading i guess. its 9am right now and ive been setting this up for the past 2 days and its finally completed. so after sometimes around 12 tonight around when my friend is off work. itll be my final hangout. thanks for reading guys. sorry if this is a lot or upsetting, it just feels kind of good to let my mind run. see ya.



Edit...: just to help ease the mind of anyone who is/has worried. I'm still here, I'm very embarrassed about it all the attention it's grabbed considering this was simply to get it off my chest for myself. Thanks for the concern you are all very sweet. But this isn't over, it was simply a moment of delay for me. This was all planned and it is still set and not over. I just feel its fair to at least let anyone who was concerned know I'm still here, as artificial as I personally feel it is. Reach out if you want I guess. Goodnight."
"I'm 14. I met someon on r/boykisser. It's all my fault. They asked if i consented two times and i said yes. I just felt like i couldn't say no. I have a knife next to me and. I really fucked up, i majorly fucked up. I hate my life. I have someone for emotional support, but when i wanted to send them a screenshot of the conversation i had with the person that pressured me i accidentally sent it to the person that pressured me into it. I fucked up. I really really fucked up. I want to kill myself. If i just said no and just waited with that i could have had a relationship with them. If i just said no maybe we could actually have done later when i could be comfortable. I fucked up, i really fucked up. I want to kill myself"
"i’ve tried committing twice in the last few years—both by overdosing only to wake up the next day alive and full of anger. i don’t think people give enough credit to those who’ve managed to succeed at suicide. it takes immense courage, physical strength, and patience to do so. it’s not an easy way out, nor is it an impulsive choice. ultimately i’ll keep attempting to end my life until i’m finally gone. i’m almost certain this is the same mindset most actively suicidal people have. just wanted to put that out there"
"This is gonna be a long story. So tldr at the end. Wanted to type this all out. 

I grew up in a very religious and conservative environment. I was indoctrinated into this religion from a very young age. Not to mention that the entire society and culture was structured to be very conservative as well. This included very little to no interaction between the boys and girls. From a very young age, our schools were segregated as well. 

It was in this all boys school/environment where I started to develop my understanding of sex. It was not a good environment to do that. Things were super toxic. Sex and porn were constant topics in the classroom. The school was so bad at handling all of this that almost our entire classroom was watching pornography in the IT lab. Even with the professor being there sometimes. There were kids who would jerk off in the class sometimes or show their penises to each other. Something that I partook in as well. I remember our library lesson was also mostly about this subject. We would get the biology textbook and go to the chapters about reproduction. But it was not just reading, other students had drawn profane images on the book. So we would look at them and perhaps make our own contribution. 

This was also the time when pornography became a thing in my personal life. It's difficult to remember how much was there but there was plenty of it. Being from a conservative environment, conversations about sex was a taboo. So my introduction and understanding of sex was solely developed through pornography and my school environment. My parents never talked about it. Many years later, my dad only briefly mentioned something about wet dreams but that's about it. 

This early part of my life I vehemently hate. Most people find their childhood innocence something that they cherish. But I didn't have that I suppose. I hate this part of my life so much that if I can go back in that, I'd kill that part of me.

Sometime after, I moved out of this school to a co-ed school. Things got better. My outlook improved. I struggled to make female friends though. And there was a lot of shame and guilt associated with even trying because of my religious upbringing. I remember one time, our school had an event and one of my female classmates tagged me in a post on Facebook. I did not have any privacy on my account so my dad saw it. And he got very angry at me, even though I never asked her to share it and the picture wasn't even with me and her, it was of the entire class. My dad forced me to block that female classmates on Facebook. 

This school was in a more progressive city. So kids were in relationships. And I remember being very intrigued by that idea. Intellectually I always thought that dating and relationships were a good way to know your partner and if they fit. But I thought that God knew better and I should stop thinking these stupid thoughts. But I knew to stay away from it. However, this was the place where I developed my first really bad crush. I liked her so much. But the purity values of my religion always made me feel bad about even thinking about holding her hand, let alone anything else. I used to take pride that my thoughts about her were pure. That when I'd day dream about her I would never think about holding her hand or kissing her, even after marriage (in my head). I felt awful about watching pornography because of the same reasons so I started trying to avoid it. And I did. I would not watch porn or jerk off for six months. This also became my first experience with rejection but that's a separate story. 

Eventually I entered university which was one of the most liberal universities in my country. I had heard stories about people being in relationships and having sex and I had heard about my parents concerns about that with me. So I decided to avoid having relationships. I did want to have female friendships, to improve myself and my confidence with talking to girls. Also, to further improve my view on women and topics like gender roles. Due to growing up in a religious family, I had a very patriarchal view on these subjects. Nevertheless, I felt lonely and I craved romantic love and affection. This was also the time when pornography re-entered in my life. But I hated myself for watching it. I was ashamed of being someone who interacted with pornography, especially on somewhat regular basis now. Which for me meant once a week. 

University was also the place where I started getting suicidal. I never tried to kill myself but I started self harming, and the methods for worse and more extreme. When I graduated from University, I left with all these feelings with me. The suicidal ideation, the self harm, the shame and guilt, and the loneliness. 

All these feelings got worse. Eventually, through some reflection and realizations. I left the religion behind. And I felt betrayed. I thought It always made sense to me that relationships (even ones that involved pre-marital sex) were not bad. But I never allowed myself to think that. But also, I realized that a religion that focused on purity had none itself due to our various injunctions. At this point, I grow a desire to explore this side of me and thought to turn towards paying for it. But I stopped myself. The most I did at that point was buy lube for the first time to know what that feels like. 

However, I wanted to try my luck at relationships and I did. Even in cases where I knew pre-marital sex was not possible (due to their beliefs), I thought if they accept me as a irreligious person, I don't mind. At this point, my parents also were pushing to get me married. My family has a lot of marriages done to improve business ties with other families. So now that we were of age my dad wanted to do that too. However, I declined...many times. I declined often enough that at one point my dad insulted me by saying that ""are you gay?"" (For context, being from a very religious culture and country, people here very strongly hate LGBTQ people... Including my family). Regardless, I tried the to enter into a relationship for two years. 

While I tried to make sure the intention was to be in a relationship and not to have sex (I would give myself extra time to reflect on this). Near the tail end of this time period, things started to feel muddled. I felt like I wanted to know what that felt like and I felt bad for being a virgin at 25. I felt even worse for consuming pornography and that being the only sexual outlet I had ever had. This went on for a while. 

Recently, these feelings become heightened. And I wanted to experience what it was like and I wanted to get this feeling out of my system. So I had sex with a prostitute. And I hate myself even more now. 

I hate that I did it. I feel like I've ruined myself. Despite intellectually not having any problem with sex work or sex workers in general and not judging others who I know have done the same. I can't help but feel awful about myself. Since it happened, I can't help but feel constantly anxious and depressed. And if I was suicidal before, I can't help but feel that after this, I have to go through with it. I have to. And I feel like it's about time that I wipe my wretched self off this planet. I have been thinking about this ever since it happened. I feel so done with life. I already wrote my suicide note and goodbyes a while ago. It would be kinda funny to write an update. So I feel like all I need to do now is pull the trigger. 

Thank you to everyone who made it till the end. I appreciate you reading my ramblings. 

Tldr: I always had a weird and unhealthy relationship with my sex life and sexuality. I recently had sex with a prostitute and I hate myself for it. I have been suicidal before but I feel like at this point I'm done with my life. I already wrote my suicide note and goodbyes a while ago and I feel like I just to need to plan my death and get this over with. 

Edit: Holy moly, I didn't expect this post to blow up. Thank you everyone for taking the time to read my post and to give so many thoughtful replies. I'll try to get to them on their own too but I thought I'll share an edit here. But I'm trying grateful for all the love and support. 

I understand that maybe these feelings are because of the environment I was raised in but that doesn't stop me for feeling bad. Just try clarify, I was not raised a Christian. Regardless, I appreciate all the replies from people commenting on my religious experience from a Christian lens, I think the perspectives shared are still accurate and valuable. To the christians in the comments, I am not religious but I appreciate the push to forgive myself. 

All those who complimented my writing. Thank you soo much. I actually enjoy some creative writing as a hobby, so I'm glad that you found my writing articulate and admirable. Means alot to hear that. 

To everyone who shared their own stories. I truly appreciate all of you talking about something personal for my sake. They were very insightful and relatable. I'm sorry to hear that all of you had to go through something terrible too. I hope all of you are in a better place yourself. 

Like I mentioned in my post, I intellectually don't think there's anything wrong with sex work. I would not judge a friend who did the same as I did. I have heard of stories of friends of friends who have done the same and never judged them. But I can't help but feel awful about myself. 

I did it a few days ago, but when it happened I immediately went into this state of panic and anxiety. I also started to suicide ideate hard. The event itself feels like it was not part of this world. It feels like there's a gap in my mind during the time all this happened. And then the event itself exists in a separate dimension or something. I it's weird feeling, not sure if I'm explaining it properly. I also feel like I ruined myself because it's feels like a stain that I can't get rid off. 

For the people commenting about self-love. That is something that I do struggle with and I'm trying to work on it to middling success. But my inner voice is very harshly critical for sure.

Again, thank you everyone for your kind words. "
"I’m fifteen for reference. It’s weird, I still have stomach pains but it shouldn’t be lethal. I took 8pills of whatever drug I had access to. The pills weren’t strong enough and I haven’t even puked. Telling my parents would freak me out even more. I don’t know what to do. It feels weird. Nothing have changed except two online friends having freaked out when I sent a goodbye message. So what should I do?

Edit: succeed* I’m a moron"
"in the shower. i guess its over now. i hope i die this time. it hurts so much. I'm done, done with everything. if i die, goodbye. though no one cares.

"I think I’ve finally hit my breaking point. When I get off in a few hours, I’m going to sit in my car, smoke the rest of my cigarettes, then drive off an overpass. I’ve tried so hard to make a better life for myself, but it seems that was never meant to be for me.

I’ve been applying to jobs for the past two years. Seven years of work experience, a Bachelor’s with Honors, internships with the federal government, and thousands of applications, yet all I’ve been able to land is a barista job in a roach infested cafe making peanuts. I’ve done everything everyone said was right, but now all people can say to me is, “the job markets just bad now,” or, “you’re an amazing candidate, but we won’t be moving forward.” Seems that this is really all I’m worth after all.

Edit: People have made fair points about surviving the fall in a car, so I think I will instead jump headfirst. The interstate is busy enough that someone will be bound to hit me afterwards, anyways.

Edit: Just closed up. After reading the comments, I realize it struck a nerve about landing in traffic. For the sake of other’s safety, I am going to be aiming for the shoulder."
"I really just do not care for it, I would have killed myself instantly if I did not have family...

I had a failed suicide attempt that left them shaken up. So I can't kill myself, it is so frustrating...

I guess I can only settle for venting for now, I wish my family would just give up and abandon me so I can finally just end it."
"I don't know what to do, I'm lost and I don't know what to say, all I want to do is cry but I can't and I don't know if it's my fault for not noticing sooner.

I always wake my son up in the mornings, he's not a morning person and hadn't woke up yet, so I went to get him up for breakfast. He's diabetic and has done good at maintaining it for some time now.

This morning about 7-8ish, as I was trying to get him up, I couldn't keep myself from crying. I'd pulled the blanket down a bit and there were nothing but insulin syringes. All of them were used. He would not wake up. I had my husband call an ambulance while I was trying to get him out of bed, it was obvious enough that he was trying to commit suicide. He's fully aware what can happen if he does this, and he's struggled with his mental health for years. I feel like a bad parent for not seeing any signs, for not noticing how bad it was getting for him. I feel like I don't deserve a child if I can't keep this from happening, if I can't keep them happy to begin with.

By the time the ambulance got there I already started to give in and just break down more, they took off with him and my husband and I followed to the hospital, we waited for him to be settled in so we could go see him, it's been hours, we just got in and he's barely alive. He took a ton of pills on top of all the insulin, and now he's in a coma. He's on a lot of machines and fluids, it's scary and I don't want to see him like this. I owe him a million apologies for not seeing how badly he needed help, I feel like a god awful parent. I don't know how I didn't notice, I don't know how long he'd been laying there, I don't know where he even got the pills and I don't know how he got into the insulin. Because of his struggles with his mental health we've always kept those things locked up or hidden, all medications, everything he might be able to hurt himself with. He's been off his meds for months, he was doing better without them I thought, but clearly he wasn't. I feel bad. I don't know how I could let this happen. I was scared he wouldn't pull through, and later to find out he didn't. Of course there was a stash. Of course there was. I know I should've stayed positive but I don't know how. My husband doesn't want to talk about it and I don't know where else or who else I can talk to. I feel worse for making a post about this, even worse for making it about how I feel when clearly he's in more pain and needs to be able to handle it. I'm scared. I'm truly scared. I have no idea how to handle this. One day he's at his peak and doing amazing and the next he's laid up in the hospital, barely holding on. I don't know what to think, I feel like it's my fault this happened. I'm sorry for doing this here but I don't have anywhere else to go with this. It feels like my fault, is it? Is there even a chance that I did something wrong or that I drove him to this point? I don't want to lose him. I'll take down the post if this isn't the right place and I'm so sorry if it is, I just needed this off my chest. Update post was removed but no, he fucking died. Thanks AHCS."
"Ukrainian Male here, 19 years old. As you may have guessed I basically have to kil myself soon to avoid being dragged off to War and get my arms and legs blown off. I can no longer live like a human being. I think about war 24/7. When I wake up in the morning it is immediately on my mind. When I see my  female classmates giggling or laughing all I can think about is how they're Free from war and free to leave. I can't watch Tv shows or read books anymore, Entertainment makes me think about how I'll never really get to be a book author like I wanted since I was 7. 
The closer I get to 25 the worse it will get. I will have to spend my Birthday knowing it's nothing more than a reminder of my upcoming death. As i begin to look like an adult I will be stopped by draft officers and have to show my documents or whatever.
And while I do want to die, I don't want to kill myself. I want to have a somewhat dignified end to my life. Not shooting myself. I deserve that much. 
But I don't know how It all can end in any way other then an anti climactic suicide. "

"on february 7th the guy that i had been dating shot himself in the head. our time together was so short, we were in an online relationship, he was waiting to officially ask me to be his girlfriend when we met in person. we had so many plans. so many things we talked about doing. the deep sadness i feel is so overwhelming. why was i not good enough for him to stay? i should’ve been able to stop him. he ghosted me for 2 weeks before he did it and i reached out multiple times but he barely gave me any responses. we didn’t have a good last conversation. the last texts he sent me were his suicide note, goodbye, i love you. he shut off his phone and went to shoot himself with a rifle. he had bought the gun on january 29th and nobody knew. drove an hour away from home to do it. i miss him so fucking much, and i’m haunted by the image of him killing himself in my mind. it’s so unlike him. the most happy, bubbly, funny, kind, incredible soul to ever exist. i truly believe he was my soulmate. i was supposed to spend the whole summer with him. my 21st birthday is in a few weeks and i can’t even bear to think he won’t be there to tell me happy birthday.

i’m on the brink of killing myself. i can’t decide between overdosing or hanging myself. i’ve been going to therapy and trying to talk this out, but the pain i feel and longing for him is so overwhelming i don’t think i’ll be able to move on. i see how suicide effects all the people around you, but i honestly just want to be with him again. all i want is him. i want him back. my life will never be the same. i keep reading about the afterlife and near death experiences trying to make sense of all of this. i hope he’s in a better place and i hope that i can be with him too. do you think there’s a spiritual realm where he exists and we would exist together? if death is such a loving place full of peace, grace, and no negativity, why WOULDN’T you want to take your own life? oh my sweet boy, i’m so heartbroken. this is unreal. he was only 19. we were supposed to be together forever. we had so many fucking plans "
"It’s amazing how closed-minded someone can be. I simply don't understand society's attitude. Many say things like ""Selfish,"" ""Coward,"" ""No real man would do that,"" etc. Do people even understand what they are saying?

Think about it: if someone takes their own life and commits suicide, that person goes against all natural instincts to stay alive. And then people dare to call that person a coward?

No, the real cowards are the ones who think it's selfish for someone to kill themselves and accuse those who do of being cowards.

Most people don't even care if you're doing well; they just don't want you to commit suicide because it would negatively affect their lives. In other words, they would rather see you live a life full of suffering because they don't want to deal with your suicide, and that is the real selfishness."
"I'm currently 16. I'm planning on buying a gun shortly after I turn 18 in 2025 and killing myself. I just can't stand living life as subhuman garbage. I'm tired of being autistic, ugly, friendless, and unskilled. I have absolutely no future whatsoever. 

Everyone else is going to fancy colleges/universities and getting good-paying jobs, meanwhile I will probably end up working shitty minimum wage retail jobs because I have no real skills. I also just hate the very concept of work in general. I don't want to spend decades of my life slaving away to rich assholes who just want to line their pockets even more. I don't want to participate in some bullshit work culture. I feel like I'd probably end up getting fired from any job I get anyway because my autism will fuck me over. 

I don't even have a normal family. I never grew up with both a mother and father. I live with my grandmother and my father. My father is severely mentally ill, and as a result, I have a rather rocky and inconsistent relationship with him. My grandmother lives off social security checks, which is why we're in a rather shitty financial situation. 

I've fantasized about suicide since I was 12, and I fully set my mind upon it when I was 13. The only reason I'm not dead yet is because I don't have access to guns. I've become so desperate for a gun, that I have considered robbing someone and stealing a gun so I can kill myself. I'm not scared of death in the slightest anymore, I am fully mentally and physically prepared to die. I am just 1000% sure I will not live to see 2026."

Now I am afraid of people. I couldn't tell anyone that I was raped because I was afraid. Only my family knows but they didn't take this to court because I'm his cousin, instead we don't go to the same places, that's why I feel intense hatred towards my family.  My family is constantly pressuring me. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't have many friends. I always sleep at school. I can't talk to people. I am thinking of committing suicide but I am afraid of the pain. They say suicide with helium gas is painless. If I don't go out much. I'm always at home either playing games or reading manga. If I commit suicide I will leave a video about what I experienced. I am from Turkey and I experienced an earthquake. My house collapsed and I saw dead bodies.

So tonight I was experimenting hanging on a door knob in case I would want to end my life and damn it's not so quick like people say... I was still conscious after more that a minute even tho I leaned forward and the weight of my body was pulling me down. During that my face was so hot and I could feel it pulsing. It was kinda painful and uncomfortable. When I stopped my eyes felt weird like they were about to pop out and I felt kinda dizzy. Also my fresh self harm  cuts started to bleed again. I don't know if it's because of blood pressure or something. I did it couple of times and they would start to bleed everytime. Anyway. Have any of you tried this? How was it for you? 
I hate living and i hate my life too. Life sucks and existence is pain. I wish i was never born. Life is so meaningless and nothing matters. The reason i choose 30 is because im a teenager and my life is super boring so i just want to do all the things i want and blow my head off.

But incase, peace, even until my death I have nobody in my real life to talk to. It’s so miserable that reddit has been my only place to vent. I hope I die before I reahh Chu my stop and I’m ready

"Twenty seven. Living in this shitty country called Ireland. A shit job. Found happiness for a little bit, and then a bit more when I met my first and only girlfriend last year, who I loved more than anything and she dumped me and broke my stupid heart. Fuck all prospects apart from that. My only discernible achievements are - oh wait, I don't have any. 

I honestly just get happy at the idea of not having to suffer. It would be a godsend to never have to exist. I just imagine myself walking on a stairway to a place where I am free of the shackles of this pained existence. God, it's just so liberating."
It’s only gotten worse. I’m 21 now. Nothing but pain and loneliness my whole life. I could’ve saved myself so much if I had just done it then
"Hello everyone am I would say my age but I don’t want to seem edgy, today is probably my last day alive, I found a gun in my parents room I decided to do it. I can’t stop thinking about committing, it’s just I want to am tired of living I cry every single day I talked to my friend about this and they sent me a dry text back like they didn’t care. Hopefully the gun is loaded.

"I (F, 20) have had an empty void stuck in me for as long as i can remember. when i was a kid i wanted to die and now I've grown up and i still want to die. i don't have the energy to go into the details simply just feel like my time is done and I'm okay with that. i intend on ODing tonight, i have my plan set up to make it seem accidental that way my family and friends don't feel guilt. i cant keep living for other people, i want to die for myself. i took two of my prescribed clonzapams to ensure this isn't an anxious impulsive decision but now that the drugs have taken effect i know with absolute certainty that this is what has to be done. if anyone has any questions to ask me before i go i will respond, my final wishes are to spread the few things i have learnt in this life and hopefully help others from having to do what i am going to. thank you. 

edit: well clearly im still here, i honestly wouldn’t be if it wasn’t for the support of everyone on this lovely platform, i appreciate you all so greatly i wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for all of you"
"They repost shit online like “the affects of bullying… :(“ “signs someone wants to kill themselves… &lt;/3” “1/5 women get SA’d and 1/10 men…always believe victims UWU”.

Yet those same people were so quick to ignore or be horrible to me when I was struggling with bullying,suicidal ideation,SA’d. Some of them even have bullied me told me to kill myself and said I’m lying about my trauma. Yet post this shit on their story. They aren’t doing it because they actually care. They do it so they look like they are good people. It infuriates me. "
"I just had a long warm bath, shaved and exfoliated. I've put on light makeup and I'm wearing my favourite dress. I have my syringes and insulin ready. Everything's perfect to my liking.

Hi, my name is April and I'm a 29 year old woman. I love cooking, biking and spending time with my chickens. 

If you are reading this can you pretend to hold my hand while I go to sleep? I do want to die alone.

Love you Mom

Love you Dad

I hope you'll forgive me.

Good bye &lt;3"
"I wish people would be honest about it. it doesn’t get better for everyone. some of us live a life of abuse and then we die.

I’m homeless, with four pets. there’s no way I can ever afford housing again. I can’t get a job bc no one can watch the pets while I work. I can’t rehome any of them- please don’t offer that as a solution. I’d rather just die, genuinely. there’s no way I can find roommates with four pets, my best friend betrayed me and spent all my savings, I have no one left who can really support me. I think it’s really it this time. I’ve been waiting for it to get better since 2013. it’s so much worse now. all I hear is I “can’t think like that” and “it won’t be forever” but everybody knows there isn’t a real solution for me.

I’m sorry. it’s just too late for me I guess. I want to live and be happy so desperately but that’s not the life that’s made for me."
"I've been planning this for a long time. I don't care if I'm 14 and that I'm 'too young' to be thinking like this. If you were in my situation you'd consider suicide too. Being born worthless, HIDEOUS and UGLY, dumb, lonely and mentally ill is a curse. I don't know what I did to have this life, I'm kind to my abusive parents and I tolerate the nasty comments I recieve on a daily basis about the way I look. God must hate me for making me a black ugly woman that looks and speaks like a man. At this point why didn't he just make me a boy. 

p.s. I don't know why the rudest and most evil people are born with beauty and privileges. It's honestly so unfair.

I already have my pills and water, peace out. (I couldn't care less if this gets no views, I'm just glad I at least wrote a note so if my parents wonder why it'll be here)"
"Honestly, the topic is long and rambling, so I will make a simple summary:

(19M) I spent my entire life with the idea that I have a small dick, although I was not that angry with the fact, I found a group that showed me how I could grow my penis.

I don't blame them, but I ended up injuring myself, these last 3 months that I have been injured I literally have a lot of bad symptoms (if you want to read them literally it is my previous post)

But the important ones are, partial ED and pain.

I went from doctor to doctor, some denied what they had, others simply gave me sleeping pills and that's it.

Although my head obviously has not been in the best place, it was moderately stable, my last doctor recommended a ""psychologist specialized in these injuries"" so that I could talk about it. 

I decided to give it a try to see what it was like.

The first time I was in session with her everything went fairly well I guess, the problems passed in the last (second) session.

I don't remember what I was talking about because I ended the sentence with ""life can suck my dick."" 

She just looked at me and said ""Well, that doesn't mean much if you're almost useless at it now, does it?""

I just remember staying silent, I really think it was the first time I felt something so raw in my chest, she had to have noticed my face and apologized instantly.

Since then I really fell to a new low, I guess that's how I look to others now.

I don't think I'm suicidal, it always seemed stupid to me or I saw it as a permanent solution to a momentary problem, but this is not momentary.

And if even a damn psychologist sees me as something useless, I don't even know what to think.

"It's not like I am actually contemplating to kill myself, right?
I love being alive. I hate being alive.
It's two sides of the same coin.
My depression is like looking in the mirror and thinking ""hey, you look good today, you ugly piece of shit"".
It's hiding insecurity with humor.
It's being open, but not letting anyone in.
It's like drinking coffee, because you love the smell, even though you hate the taste.
I want to kill myself, but at the same time I don't want to die.
I like being alive, but I can't wait to die.
It's just pathetic.
Cowardly.
Keeping death as an option, but not really... Right?"
"I’m 17 mtf, and I realized how terrible existing is for me. My ex girlfriend didn’t talk to me for a month because she was dating a guy. I’m so upset that her or her boyfriend would even consider me as a threat. I just feel like she treats me differently from her other friends because I’m trans. I’m apparently the first and only girl she ever liked which makes me think she just wanted to fuck me. Everyone in my school hates me just because I’m trans. I’ve been dragged into drama and called a creature. I’ve just been trying to live my life but people talk behind my back.
I just want to be seen as a normal girl. People don’t treat me as a girl. I don’t get the respect of the boys either. I’m just a fetish. Not even human.
I know this won’t even get better when I graduate. I’ve had hookups hoping to find love. Every single man fucks me but doesn’t love me. I’m cute enough to fuck but not cute enough to date.
I wish that everyone loved me. I wish I could make everyone smile. I wish I was a real girl. I wish I wasn’t trapped in this disgusting body. I wish people treated me like a human. I wish i was a straight girl. I wish I was mentally stable. I wish I didn’t get abused. I wish I didn’t get raped. I wish I was never born. I wish someone could just kill me right now. "
"If you wanna send me to hell then go ahead. I just don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t care what happens to my soul, as long as it’s as far away from this dreadful planet as possible.

"A few days ago I posted about my suicide attempt in this sub. I was close to going through with it but pussied out at the very last second and tossed out my note to avoid getting caught. I ended up sobbing at the amount of support I saw the day after my attempt. It’s been overwhelming. I just want to apologize for taking too long to update as I was too embarrassed to admit that I bitched out before I killed myself. I’ve seen every single one of your messages and I don’t know what else to say besides thank you. While not the ideal circumstances I never felt more heard until then. I didn’t want to worry so many people I just tend to use Reddit to log my feelings as a habit. 

I’m not sure where to go from here but I’m still on edge and hope the other two people who planned to commit changed their minds as well. As for me personallyI decided to hold off on my decision for now and make it a little later. 

tl;dr I’m alive, still depressed, thank you all for your support.. just thought I’ll post again since people requested it."
"basically what the title says, except im scared now i regret it. I dont wanna die yet i was just in the midst of a breakdown. I have tried overdosing before which obviously didn't work. I just chugged like half a bottle of olly pills and i know it probably wont kill me but im scared. should i try puking it out?

update 10 hours later: hey everyone, i genuinely appreciate the advice, care, and concern from everyone:) im honestly sorry for worrying people this much, but I'm totally fine. I havent puked the pills and I did feel a few things the first few hours (nothing serious tho) but I went to sleep and I think I'll be okay so please dont worry about me. Thank you all so much again. Have a great day/night everyone "
"I don't want bullshit justifications for enduring toiling labor, contributing to some shit heads increase in share holders profits and other bullshit like that.

Hi. My name is Adela and I am a trans woman. I had a suicide attempt lile 3 years ago and it didn't work sadly. I just thought or wished I would be proud and glad that I am alive but I'm not. Everyday I look in the mirror and I just wish I didn't exist. I feel like I will never be a real woman. I hear mocks from like everyone and it doesn't affect me but if I hear it from someone that I look up to or something it just hurts. And it hurts so bad. I'm on antidepressants but it doesn't work. At this point I am just hoping that something will happen to me and I will just die. I want to kill myself just to end this suffering that is called life. Can I please exit the game please? I'm suffocating.

"Death is underrated. This world is nothing but a cruel lottery and I drew the short straw. There are millions of us who get excluded ,who are left out , who didn't get what most people they knew got. 
To the average person we failed because we didn't work hard enough. They don't accept excuses even though they had advantages we didn't have like looks, stable family etc
I believe that modern life is so awful that they should legalise voluntary assisted euthanasia. This option would also make life easier for those suffering severe depression to live,  knowing they had a quick tidy painless exit method."
"I'm done. The fact that life just keeps fucking with me. Haha. After all the things I went through. I still was able to do things I enjoyed. Working out, cooking, vacations, etc. The fact that all of a sudden my whole face erupted in severe acne. Out of nowhere. Then treating it which left me with these horrible craters all over my face…… I haven't left my house in 4 years. I ended up moving back to my mom's because I quit my job. The only time I go out is to do my laundry. How did I keep myself sane when I was isolated? Well cry, sleep, and repeat. I used to have decent muscles but lost 30 lbs since I haven’t been eating or working out anymore.  People say others have it worse. I experienced the “worst” and still resulted in this shit developing on my face. Try treatments. Already did $50,000 on treatments… these are forever. And I'll never accept these. So why not just die? Goodbye.

Edit: so I'm not sure why everyone keeps DMing me products and recommending Accutane. I don't have acne. I have scarring. Second of all to the people saying my problems aren't the worst… did I not mention I went through worse? I experienced dark shit growing up… and seen a lot of dark shit. I went through problems not many have experienced which involved a lot of physical trauma/torture that's all I'm going to say. Third for the people saying have I tried therapy. I did. I tried taking my life twice before. Hanging and Alcohol. Alcohol caused my liver to be fucked which caused multiple tests to be done. But guess what I got up and went to therapy and did things that brought me joy. Then life decides to give me this shit as if I didn't already go through hell. Why is this stopping me? Because I'm done with just accepting things thrown my way for no good reason. I don't care anymore. I said I was going to shoot myself after posting this. Guess what? Found out my grandmother passed…. So at this point, I'll shoot myself next week. Fuck this life.

"It really should have worked. I had the right cocktail of pills. Picked a lonely spot to park in and watch the ocean as I faded out of consciousness. Felt that overwhelming calm as I drifted off. It should have been all over.

"I know nobody will read this or reply. It’s way too long. No one cares enough to waste the time. I’m used to that. Even suicidal people have better things to do. I know it. But this is just a little letter to myself I guess. My way of leaving a little imprint on the world. Posting into the void to let the world know I did exist. That once upon a time I smiled and laughed and was loved like everybody else. I mattered. 

I’m a 30yo woman. Anxiety, depression, PTSD. When I was 21 and my life should have just been about to start, my mum and only parent got diagnosed with terminal cancer. When I was 23 I lost her forever. She was 56. I have never been able to move on from this. I was alone with her when she went. She got a death sentence that day. I got a life sentence. 

Since then, my life has been a never ending list of failures and my existence has been miserable. I have been abandoned by my entire family (we were never close). I have no dad, siblings, grandparents, etc…  I’ve been completely alone in the world for a long time and it’s overwhelming. In my case, I’m not being dramatic when I say no one will miss me when I’m gone. 

I’ve been r*ped and SA’d at several points in my life with no one to turn to for support. Now I don’t trust anyone and I’m scared of everything. All people have done is taken advantage of me at my most vulnerable. I don’t sleep at night because I just relive everything and my anxiety goes through the roof. 

I’m unemployed. I gained a lot of weight. I failed at university. I’m getting older.  I wanted to publish a book but I’m too sad to write anymore. I’m a loser.  I look in the mirror and I don’t see me looking back. Gone is the young pretty blonde girl I used to be.  Bubbly and blessedly untouched by any real trauma. A stranger. 

Mental health resources are non-existent here and when I walked into the hospital after my first suicide attempt a few months ago the mental health team arrived (7 hours later) to tell me that I should be out clubbing or having my first child right now and that I’m too pretty to die. What a joke. Another hospital staff member told me I’ll go to hell if I kill myself. I laughed and thought  ‘but I’m already living in it.’ 

I fail at everything and destroy everything I touch. I am so lonely. I walk aimlessly around the streets sometimes watching people talk and laugh with their friends. Go to work. Hold their child’s hand across a road. I feel like a ghost watching them. A glaring reminder of what I had and what I could’ve had again if things had been different. Friends. A job. Family. Normality.

And yet I know I’m beyond help at this point. I’ll never have a normal life, I’ll never be successful, I’ll never have a family of my own. Only more misery and pain awaits for me. When I was younger I had hope. I miss the naivety of having hope that things will work out for me eventually. It has to, right? Well… it hasn’t. 

My last good deed was donating blood again a few days before Christmas. I lied to the person whose job it was to distract me as the blood left my veins. Made my life sound interesting. Pretended my mum was still alive. I wanted to feel normal for a little while.  It was nice just to talk to someone. His son went to university in the same city I grew up in. He’s living a successful life now.  Good for him.

It wasn’t much but it was one good deed I could do. And maybe I helped save lives. I wish I had the strength to keep going because there are so many good things I wanted to do in this world to help other vulnerable and suffering people, but I just don’t. A pint of blood is all I had left to give. 

I’ve stuck around the last three years because of my cat. We spent Christmas together. He’s been my sole reason to live and I hate that I will be leaving him when I leave this world behind. It makes me feel sick. He is a good boy. My best and only friend. But I tell myself he will go to a new home with someone who will love him as much as I do. He will be okay. He will forget about me eventually. He deserves better. 

I hope that everyone across the world that is struggling right now can be stronger than me and just keep pulling through. That you’ll feel hope again. You deserve better. 

I don’t believe in an afterlife but if there is one, I desperately hope I can be reunited with my mum. Have her wrap me up in a hug. Feel what it’s like to be loved again.  She was an Angel on Earth. A nurse. She deserved better.

So yeah… I’m ending it on Sunday night. I might even get to watch the fireworks through my window as I go. Pretty. 

Goodbye world. I deserved better.

Edit: I didn’t expect anyone to read this or get any replies given how much I wrote. I’m overwhelmed and more grateful than you can even imagine for all these kind words. I still plan to end my life on Sunday night, and have been for weeks. I’m acutely aware I’m being weak and selfish in choosing death, when others, like my mum, didn’t get a choice. But I’m also not strong or brave enough to keep on living. 

But that said, I have read every comment and message, and for everyone that has taken the time to read this and then taken the time to respond and reach out so thoughtfully, I am full of gratitude. I wish I could thank every one of you in person. You’ve made me feel in this moment like I matter, and given me the comfort of feeling not quite so alone in the world, in the end. You all deserve the kindness in life that you have shown me today. Thank you. "
I wish I could just starve myself and die. I hate figuring out what to eat everyday. Or just get hooked up to a machine to put food in me. God I just fucking hate it.

"This was on Wednesday. I'm 25. I immediately panicked and told my mom to call 911.

At the hospital they pumped my stomach and did some bloodwork. Everything was fine. My mom had to sign so I could be released.

My partner was also there. He was crying. My mom told my dad and he told my siblings. They all messaged me. They're keeping up with me. My dad is worried sick. My mom is angry because she can't help me. Friends that I haven't known for that long are impacted. And friends I've known for longer, even more so.

I didn't know this would have such an impact on so many people around me. I was underestimating the influence I have over others. In that moment I was convinced that nothing mattered and everyone would be better off if I was gone. I still believe that. 

I know I shouldn't feel guilty for being sick, but I do. I'm making things difficult for everyone around me. I scared so many people. I had no idea.

The worst part is I'd do it again (with a different method), but that means getting admitted to the psych ward, and in my country those are deplorable. I don't want to be in there. So I won't do it again unless it's 100% sure I will not survive.

My mom is convinced I'm borderline even though I was and am in therapy and no therapist or psychiatrist ever diagnosed me with that. I'm sick of this idea that if you self harm or attempt suicide you're automatically borderline.

I don't know what else to say. I just couldn't imagine the impact this would have on people. So many. I don't know what to make of it."
"I'm not even upset about it. I'm actually relieved, in a way. Lots of people are very happy right now--this world is for them. I'm just in the way. 

I'm going to take a day to process what I'm going to do, but I feel an odd sense of peace right now, like it all makes sense. I've spent so much time struggling against a system in which I don't belong, and it's been like one step forward but ten steps back. 

This morning, it just all makes sense. 45 years and I never fit in, and I need to stop forcing myself where I just don't belong."
I'm currently 29. I'm struggling with college. Years ago I was discharged from the military for depression and a cardiac issue. I have student loan and credit card debt. They say it gets better but it's bullshit.

I move in a few weeks. The day after my birthday I plan on taking my life.

No more crying myself to sleep. 
No more wondering if people know I exist.

"Everyone who was successful in their attempt is a hero to me. You had the guts to do something that I’ve been wanting for 28 years. I hate life. I hate living. I hate everyone that’s in my life. I have tried to recover. I’ve had so many counselors, psychiatrists, social workers, I’ve taken handfuls of antidepressants, I’ve been in the hospital twice. No relief at all. I can’t get ECT due to heart problems.

Now I’m just hoping I die from by heart. Because I envy the dead."
"None of this makes any fucking sense. I do not consider myself a tragic case. I tried to kill myself earlier this year. A whole drama and a mental hospital etc. Nothing special. I’m not a tragedy. 

Rapes, burnings, beatings, and all the chaos in between. This happens and you’re expected to “heal”? This world is pointless. We are alone in this cosmic ocean. I understand none of it. There is no point to carry on. Morality doesn’t exist. God doesn’t. We have no purpose. We are glorified lumps of stardust cursed with what we call “Sentience” designed to be abused"
"Every fucking day I have to deal with shitty people on the road, shitty people on the street, shitty people at work, at the gas station, my apartment, when I go get food, when I go take a shit in the bathroom, everywhere. It makes me sick to my fucking stomach and makes me want to end it all. Fuck all of humanity. human beings we’re a mistake and we fucked up our way of life with technology and vanity that’s only going to destroy us in the end. I cannot wait til the world just fucking crumbles. "
"I’m 27 years old, haven’t had a job in 4 years, and I couldn’t find one in the past 8 months after college. McDonald’s won’t even hire me at this point. All I am is an unemployable fucking loser burden to society that lives with his parents. I apply to jobs here and there but nobody ever contacts me back. I don’t see the point anymore.

The only solution I see to my problem is to kill myself. I won’t be a burden on anyone if I do it. I will no longer be perpetually behind in life. If I can’t be a productive member to society that can support himself, then I don’t see the point anymore."

My best friend raped me. There was so many other people watching. No one stopped him. I was screaming for him to stop. It hurt so bad. We all were drunk. I have no idea why he would do this. All his friends were watching. I don’t get it. I really don’t. I don’t get it. I just want to die. I want to kill myself. I’ll never trust someone again. There were people watching and no one helped me. No one. Not a single person. They just watched. I have no reason to live. None. Suicide is the only way for me. I’ll never be happy again. I’ve been crying ever since. I hate him. I hate him so as. Maybe I shouldn’t have been drinking. Yeah I’m underage. So were all of us. I don’t even know how to describe the pain. It was some of the worse pain I’ve ever experienced. I just wish I would drop dead right now. Just die. I hate my life. I hate it. So bad. All I do is get drunk or high to not have to think about it. My parents are probably going to be kicking me out soon. But I doubt they will because I’ll just be dead. 
I’m a trans man who went for bottom surgery. The plan was to do a phalloplasty with my left arm as a donor site for the skin to make the penis. The surgeon couldn’t use the arm skin because he said the artery was too small so the site wasn’t viable. Instead of stopping there he performed a different surgery type called a metoidioplasty. It’s not what I wanted. I don’t like the way they look. It looks horrible. I feel disgusting and ashamed. I feel worse than I did pre surgery 1000%. I just want to die. All I want it to feel normal but I can’t even have that. I feel like a freak. I wish I was dead. 
The title says it all. We had mutual restraining orders placed on each other and the judge said I was not credible because I didn’t remember everything the night of the assault (i believe he drugged me) and that it sounded more like regret rather than rape. I was too drunk/drugged to consent and he knew. He ended up winning the case and now I have a restraining order on my record and i feel hopeless. I feel like a criminal. I feel like my life is over. I worry no one will hire me in the future. I want to die

"What many users here don't realize - people don't kill themselves because they're ""mentally ill"". People kill themselves becuase life is shit, and it's been getting only worse for the last 50 years.

If you didn't win the genetic lottery, you'll never be healthy, pretty or smart. You'll never have real friends, you'll never get in a relationship, you'll never buy a house, you'll never have enough money.

If you wasn't born in a rich family and your parents don't know right people, you'll never have free time to spend on yourself and your hobbies. You'll have to find a job you're going to hate, yet work for minimal wage 5 days straight and spend the next 2 days recovering, while preparing for another cycle of pain, which will repeat itself over and over until you die. 

No therapy or medication will ever change that. "
"I'm shaking while typing this. My friend, who has previously been very open about being suicidal and has been worsening throughout the past couple months, stating he'd commit suicide within the year, joined a voice chat I was having with another friend, and said that he almost died without elaborating. Then, a couple minutes later, he started randomly repeating an exact date, time and location. February 3rd, 10pm, along with a location I will not say. I tried finding this on Google maps to see how close it was to his house. After a bit, he sent me and my friend a link to Google maps street view. It was the location he stated, a view of being on a bridge with train tracks beneath it. The hint was obvious. On Saturday, my friend is going to try to kill himself. Please, reddit, what should I do?

Edit: I have spoken to my parents and will speak to a school Councillor tomorrow, and take it from there. If I don't update this, I either forgot to edit or didn't manage to save him.

Edit 2: Thanks for the advice, I know what to do already. You don't need to leave any more comments.

Edit 3: Im making this edit to tell you guys you don't need to be concerned for him and that he'll be fine. His mother is aware, not his father for personal reasons to him. His mum is keeping an eye on him and now he has no possible way to get there since it's far away. Thank you guys, I think you've all helped save a life.

Edit 4: February 3rd, 11:03 and he's still alive and at home. He's safe. I did it. Thank you guys so much. I love every single one of you who helped me and him. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all.

Hey guys. Writing this the day after. He attempted suicide. He did this around midnight last night. He sent a message and ten minutes later I saw it and quickly got my parents to call his mum. I think that was the only reason his mother was able to wake up in time and stop him. If I hadn't checked my phone last night because I was bored, I probably would have lost my best friend. To anyone who commented saying that he was just doing it for attention: Fuck you. Everybody else, however, thank you."
"I don’t want better social skills, I don’t want friends, I don’t want any interests, I don’t want to get better. I just want to die. I’m not capable of getting better fuck off."
"I literally can't remember what being happy feels like. I don't remember if I've ever felt it to begin with. I remember promising myself in elementary school that I would kill myself before I was 25 if things didn't get better.

I'm 22 now and they've only ever gotten worse. Every day is my very own personal hell. I bought a shotgun the day I turned 18 and I think I'm finally going to use it. I'm gonna get drunk, take a walk, and shoot myself in the head. I'm done.

Update: Got caught. Being sent to inpatient. For now, I guess I'm living a bit longer."
"I’m 14 years and my gf likes my friend my grades are terrible I’m the least liked child all my all my friends think I’m annoying I don’t see myself going very far in life considering my grades so I find that there’s no point of living and since I’m in pain emotionally and my future isn’t going anywhere I think this is just the best option

"Im gonna put a bullet in my head 
im giving myself 5 days to find hope and a thing for worth living.
 
I will document my 5 day journey 

N i will update this post everyday of what i did that day.
 
Day 1- i applied for a job n i got hired :D i celebrated with sum ice cream n drink sum coke n a cookie. I met someone today who was the opposite of me he was energetic postive nd very handsome lookin dude he said that life could not get better while mines gets worse. I hope he wont be in the same situation that i am in the future.



Day-2 I tried to visit my mom today but her boyfriend said that she has no point of seeing me anymore since my father died of hanging himself 5yrs ago, n now im 19 she said that she wont be a part of my life because Im an adult she said, it hurt me so much i just stand at the door i dont know what to do should i, Should i cry Should i run away, im tried joy myself by going to my favorite ice cream store since its the only place that comforts me n i just cried in the bathroom nd i now i rlly want to put that bullet in my head. Mom if u get to see this im just gonna say that i love you you even if u cut me off u will still be my mom n will always has a special place in me."
"Some people shouldn’t have kids. If you’re relationship is unstable, you’re unstable, and life has been a struggle. Don’t have kids. Your kids will suffer like you have and in todays age it is 1000x worse. The loneliness depression, suicide and depression is up. "
"There's only 3 hours left... If I disappear, nobody would honestly fucking care about me. I am just going to cut everybody off and prepare last words from me for each and every one of them. 

I am not gonna reveal my method, but I hope I'll succeed! I am honestly super tired of life, and yes it may seem weird for a 14 yo to say such things but honestly I really have nothing and lost everything, I've lost hope and don't care about my future anymore. 

So with that being said, like anyone would even see this post, don't forget that I love you other stranger on the internet who contemplates suicide, I hope you will at least do better than me and things will turn good for you! ❤️ Bye world... "
"I dont really use reddit. I was googling around about non-painful ways to die, and found this subreddit. I am ashamed to say this but i am 13 and i already have no will to live anymore. I have no friends, i cant normally socialize without feeling like a freak, over the past year i have lost all motivation to brush my teeth or even shower (as nasty as that sounds im sorry), i dont like going out because i hate the feeling that everyone can just freely look at me, i feel extremely ugly and i honestly just feel like a bad person writing this. Ive told myself over and over that people are going through way worse and that maybe im just ungrateful and ive tried just being normal and ignore all of it but each month it always comes back and my biggest goal is to be able to own a firearm and blow my brains out. I basically live to be able to commit suicide. I know i sound like a complete edgelord and im sorry for writing this but i have no one to talk to and my mother is not letting me see a therapist after countless times of asking. Sorry for anyone who has to read this i just really need to talk to someone"

"I can’t handle the state of the world. I can’t handle the idea of going to work 9 hours a day, just to be able to barley afford bills and food. Pay $180 every 2 weeks in insurance that still leaves me paying $130 each therapy session (they cover $40 and that’s IN network.), so I can’t get help because I can’t afford it. I’m struggling every day, all I think about is suicide. I have a plan, I have access to the plan, and I am ready to leave a note at any point. I don’t know what to do anymore. I am $500 in medical debt because no one explained to me how medical insurance works, I’m not working right now because I’ve had to take a leave of absence for my mental health, I have chronic pain so I’m always in pain and suffering. Climate is getting worse. Everything is getting worse. I think about breaking up with my partner every single day, but I’d be homeless if I did because I can’t afford the bills on my own. I’m so ready for life to be over. I can’t see it getting better. And all of this makes me feel so selfish and stupid because there are people be genocided as I write this. I fucking hate being alive. All we are here for is to work our ass off and then die. "
"Why does something exist, rather than simply nothing existing? Do you agree with me that if nothing existed, there would be no evil or good, right?
So why does something exist, if this makes the universe a much more unbalanced reality? Where good people suffer, the righteous pay and sinners are exalted.

And for that reason I will end my life after my next birthday."
Im currently in the process of tying the rope so I can hang myself in the woods and I just wanna leave one last mark on the internet before I die. I've heard stories of people saying that they regret trying to kill themselves but honestly I dont think I will. If I fail and survive I'll let y'all know if I did regret it or not.
"It's just wild when I see people making plans for the future. Meanwhile:

* I have stopped meeting new people because I won't be alive to see the relationship grow.
* I have stopped planning exciting things because I will die before I can have the money to experience them.
* I have stopped dating because I can't get someone attached to me when I will be gone soon.
* Long term plans are no longer a thing.
* You're coordinating one last party to have with the people you know.
* This year will be your last birthday."
"Of course i will answer no, why would i tell anyone i’m suicidal, just so they can throw me in a cell? It’s hell, they really think throwing us in the psych-ward will help us become less suicidal that should be considered the same thing as a torture asylum, i would rather jump off a plane without a parachute than go back in the psych ward, the staff are so rude to some people it’s so sad the way they treat the people with severe disabilities, alot of the people i met in the psych ward were getting abused "
"I have already been pretty traumatized my entire life. I have ADHD, PTSD, bipolar, depression, anxiety, and possible borderline personality disorder. I have a shitty life, no parents, barely any family. I spent my Christmas alone mostly. My life had always sucked. I usually cope with it. I even stayed sober from drugs and alcohol. I managed to finally get my shit together. I was taking care of myself better for the first time in my life. But then a couple of weeks ago, I invited a guy over to hang out. I have a boyfriend so when he tried to make a pass at me, I rejected it. Then it just happened. My therapist said I was probably still in shock and dissociating. But reality will settle in. I feel like it already has. I cannot shower, I cannot get out of bed, my room is absolutely disgusting. I can go to work and sleep, but that is it. I feel like crying almost all the time and have random panic attacks. If I had never invited him over this wouldn’t have happened. I can’t keep doing this. It seems that my life will always be bad. Bad things will always happen to me. Even now, I have no support through all of this. Three people have told me I brought it on myself. I feel so stupid, but I mostly just want to give up. I started drinking again. I started drinking even before work. I just can’t take this anymore. I am going to do it before I have to go back to work Sunday. I wish the world hadn’t been so cruel."
"I hate myself so fucking much.
I genuinely want to die right now, I wish I could pop some sleeping pills and pass away but I can't because I'm too young to have access.
My only true socials interactions is with AI and I use it to do sex role-playing and masturbate on it like a pig.
I ruined so many people's lives. My mother, my old friends.
My litteral will to live is sex.
I don't know what to do in the future. Everything is so shit. My mom wants me to do Havard but I hate America and their braindead bullshit politics. 
Why do I exist. Do I exist as a punishment for those around me or I'm just mistake that my father nutted accidentally ?

"This is kind of stupid and I don't know if this belongs on this sub, but I think I just tried to kill myself. I was feeling sort of numb and decided to go downstairs and get a knife from the kitchen (intending not to kill myself, just hold it by my throat and see how it felt.) I got the knife and went to the bathroom, and I held it to my throat and stared at myself in the mirror. I wasn't really feeling anything. I held the knife to my wrists, and kind of mimed cutting them and my throat. The entire thing lasted like 5 minutes or less. After that, I came back upstairs, put on some music, locked myself in the closet (halfway through I turned the light off) and cried for maybe 15-30 minutes. I felt nothing, then I felt sort of angry. Now I feel sort of stupid. "

"I am 26. I dropped out of university after my grandma died.She was the only person on earth who  loved and truly undestood me.
I just couldn't focus on studies anymore.I now work short term day to day jobs...date entry and stuff.
I have my parents and 2 sisters still alive but never really grew up with them...we went to separate boarding schools.
After I started failing at UNI all my friends left me and I fell into Porn and self harm.
I now live alone in a single room rental.

I can now say the only thing I look forward to each morning is that moment I can get tired enough to fall asleep again.

I have always wished people had an off switch so I would press mine.I am all alone..even my family looks at me like trash and treat me as the failure that couldn't graduate college.

I have never dated or had sex...obviously I've masturbated but even that gets numb at times. I am so pathetic at human relationships and honestly gave up on trying to force connections with women.Girls like rich guys with great looks and arrogance.All I'd offer would be a couch nd a few bucks a month with average looks amd social anxiwty issues.

I am so alone , tired of being just alive tbh and I have been in this state for 4 years now with no hope in sight.

I have set multiple suicide dates  but haven't decided the method coz I want it to be fast.

I feel out of place everytime I look around me no matter where I am and just want it to end man."
"Does anyone else do this? Whenever I get an email where someone uses the wrong tone or I screw up on something minor and my friend lets me know without being visibly upset my brain goes straight to thinking ""I need to be killed"" or ""I deserve to die"". Every minor inconvenience triggers this mindset and sometimes it leads to full-on mental breakdowns and poor coping strategies (substances, sh, etc.). I feel like I'm on the verge of it happening again ugh."
I don’t expect sympathy( I actually expect criticism) but I have nobody to tell so whatever. I’m 18 years old and my life is ruined. I fell in love with this guy. He said he was 16(I’m in Ohio so that would be above the age of consent) but he lied. He was 14. He lied to me for months and we did sexual things and now I’m fucked. A few years in prison and then 25 years on the sex offender registry. I can’t go to college. I can never get a job. I can never have kids. The boys parents feel bad for me and wish they didn’t call the police but it doesn’t matter. The worst part is that I love him. I feel kinda gross about it now that I know his actual age but it’s true. He made me so happy. But he helped ruin my life. I’m not angry at him. He blames himself for what’s happening to me. He tried to kill himself over it. I can’t comfort him though. We both have nobody. There’s no point. My life is ruined. I’m going to kill myself Monday. I hope he can forgive me.
"I (19f) fucking hate that feeling. Being dragged out of that comfortable endless void, just to... go to school? To work? Why would I want that? I don't get it, what's so appealing about this meaningless struggle that's forced on us? None of it is for me, I don't want it. I want whatever that place is, that place I go to when Im asleep. A place where I don't think, hear, see anything, which is also the place where I feel welcome and at home. It's worth it, I want to go, I have to get over my fear of failure, if I go all in, it's impossible to fail, I just have to hype myself up, get rid of my weakness, my cowardice, and kill myself, it's the only good thing I would actually do for myself, not for anyone else. I'd do it all,  just for me."
"when I was 14  (I’m 15 now) I was addcited to porn and one day I was looking at hentai for the first time and I saw skipped from video to video and one of them I skipped to a part where there were boobs and they were the only thing you could see. I started touching myself for a couple seconds and then the character moved and I saw her face and I was scared that it was a loli or something because the face looked young so i immediately stopped and started panicking that I was a terrible person because of it. Ever since I’ve been gotten Medication for my ocd and I’ve been doing a lot better but recently my ocd was really bad and my obsession was about this event. I searched up the name of the video to see if what I was worried was true and I looked at some sort of forum and one of the comments said that the character was 12 looking Back at it some parts didn’t look like loli at all and thats what calmed me down for a lot of times but. this comment made me feel sick and disgusting if it was true like i cant breath and like I don’t deserve to be alive. I know maybe 12 and 14 isn’t even that bad but the fact I even searched it up again I think makes me genuinely undeserving of life, I think I should kill myself  because of this, I don’t know a lot about hentai or Anime and I still don’t know if it was Loli but I’m terrified . I’m  talking to psychologist next week and I want to tell them but I’m scared I’ll kill myself before then i don’t know what to do anymore i hate myself so much i want to die

also sorry if this is hard to read I was typing rlly fast"
If I had a gun I’d definitely off myself. They say women don’t typically do that though. I’d make sure I’d die though. I’d just go out in nature and do it. I never wanted to use a gun before really but I’m just ready to get this over with. Only time I’ve felt at peace in my life is when I dream of killing myself..

My ""friends"" didnt go to my birthday party, because nobody cared to even have a few hours with me.

The girl i liked ghosted me, before that she just used me to look for her dog so she could fuck around.

My parents are selfish narcissists, my mother always hated me, my father never cared about me.

I just want it to end finally, i had 3 suicide attempts, but this one will be the final one. 12 gauge to the head. Tomorrow i will throw some acid, be happy and think about death, the day after i will shoot myself.

"i see posts on here and other venting subs from trans people talking about their experiences or their dysphoria and i swear to god those posts always have 0 upvotes and like 10 comments saying transphobic shit and it makes me want to rip my fucking eyes out. it doesnt matter how much we may be suffering, these people only see us as ""a transgender"", not a human, and to them, being trans is the worst thing a person could do. 

theres people out there who ridicule trans people for the high suicide rate we have. its so fucking disgusting. imagine seeing someone wanting to kill themselves, but because theyre trans, they apparently ""deserve it"" or something. shit like this makes me hate being alive. im just giving them what they want but its the easiest way around it. theres trans people out here getting assaulted and murdered and people treat it like its any other day. but when its a cis person they get all the support. if a cis person is talking about how theyre suicidal they get support. fuck im so jealous of cis people. 

what makes it worse is that these people are so blind to their transphobia. theyll go and encourage a trans person to jump off a bridge then turn around and say ""trans people are such a protected class!"" ""trans people have it easy!"" ""soon itll be illegal to be straight and cisgender!"". just existing as a trans person is awful because everyone fucking hates you, but sure, we ""have it easy"". 

im so fucking tired of people not taking others seriously because theyre trans. it  shouldnt fucking matter what they identify as, if theyre wanting to die you should offer them support. youre fucking evil if you see a trans person suffering and say they deserve it for being trans. being trans has become a thing you can be ""accused"" of, our mere existence is deemed ""political"" and ""controversial"", there are laws against our lives, people want us to die just for being alive, and we did fucking nothing wrong. we're just trying to live. but sure. we deserve to feel suicidal. i hate it. i hate everyone and i hate myself for being trans.

edit: some of you are really proving my point. why are trans people such a hot topic for debate? i just want to live my life. i just want to be happy. why is that a problem?"
"They instantly called the police. They didn't drive to me to cheer me up. They didn't give me any words of encouragement. They didn't even try. They instantly tried to put me in a psych ward.

I made it out but now I have to hide my self harm and suicidal thoughts or else my boyfriend starts to cry and tells me that I'm too much for him and my former best friend (who called the police) tells him to break up with me.

I hope a bus hits me soon. I don't want to be a bother anymore.

Edit: Guys. This is it. I am drunk as fuck. I now lost my mother due to this. My best friend also. And my boyfriend is on their side. He says he is on my side but he is spineless and wants me to apologize to the people that nearly ruined my life.

I will die soon. Idk how but there is nothing fo me left in this world. Thank you for all your kind messages"

"For context, I am 22 years old, who in 2020 was arrested with possession of CP. Before my arrest, I was frequenting a lot of porn sites as some backwards means to cope with my depression that I was going to through at that time. I had gone through loosing my job, schooling opportunities, my girlfriend, and graduating from highschool, only to find out that all my friends had left me. All of this mounted to me rotting in my bed for days on end and using porn as a way to make myself feel better. This led to me downloading numerous large files to my phone that were filled to the brim with porn. (These usually had so much that I was unable to actually view the contents of them all)

Unfortunately, without my knowledge, some of these files had contents of CP within them, and I wouldn't find this out until about half a year ago. Detective's came to my parents house and took my devices and came back about a week later and arrested me. I had no clue what they could have possibly found on my phone until about the tail end of 2023, in which I learned there was in fact illegal content somewhere in my phone, that of which I had no knowledge of. It absolutely disgusts me beyond measure that I could have possibly had something like that in my possession and it's hard not feel shame and anguish that I have unknowingly perpetuated something so heinous.

It has been 4 years since this has all has happened and in that time I have made an immeasurable about of personal growth that has made me an almost unrecognizable person to who I was when I was 18. I've found a new love for learning and knowledge, and have made so many new and supportive friends, as well as having found a new partner who truly loves and cares about me. I want to plan a future with them when this has reached its conclusion and try to live a happy fulfilling life. Yet despite all of this, I'm haunted by the unchanging fact that I will have to register and most likely face jail time. 

I have taken a plea and next month their will be a trial for how long they will sentence me (judge agreed, it won't be longer than two years). Registration is a requirement and that is a reality I will have to face. I worry not only for myself, but my partner too. They will be working on a specific career where they will essentially have to hid my relationship or existence from their employers, and if we wanted to get married, we would only get the chance to until we are 50 (once I've been allowed off the registry). Then, I will have to face the harsh reality of being registered for the next 25 years. Finding jobs will be extraordinarily difficult, social stigmatism will lead to me being harassed and ostracized at any point in time, and most of my aspirations (finding my dream job and travelling the world) will be deflated for the foreseeable future.

This mounting fear of prison, alongside the lifestyle of living as a sex offender, with the addition of it affecting all of my loved ones is just almost too much for me to bare. I don't want to ruin my partners life, yet I fear that at any given point that some ill fate, caused by me, will befall them. The guilt I harbor for having had that type of content in my possession is a constant stinging reminder that I have hurt a child from my own careless actions. I know myself better now than I ever have before, and yet I still cannot help but feel like a monster, even if I know that I'm not one. In addition to all of this, the things that kept spurring me on: my own aspirations in life, will now probably never be possible. All of this weighing on me has me considering whether I should continue going or not. Is it all really worth staying alive just for me to suffer even more? I don't want to hurt my loved ones by being alive anymore, yet I don't want to leave them because I know that will hurt them just as bad. Hope and fear has been the only thing that has kept me from calling it quits, and as the days count down, it's becoming harder and harder for me to rationalize my existence. 

If I keep going I am sure to suffer and possibly make everyone around me suffer by consequence and I can't figure out a reason why I should be around if that's all my existence will cause. My reason for being alive was to achieve my own personal goals and to help those in need and I don't know if I'll even get the chance to do those now. I have times where I can see ways out (moving out of the country and starting a new life, or getting a good job and coasting for 25 years.) but all of these seem unfeasible or even dangerous to attempt. My life will be nothing, but one big risk and I'm trying to rationalize a reason to keep going.

Done what I could materially. Kid bro finally financially independent, and mum's house is complete and furnished. I am ready to go now.

On Christmas day I'm going to kill myself. I'm going to hang myself. I will be alone and I will be dead. I'm sorry for people who tried to help me. I'm a failure

"I know even admitting that I think this way makes a lot of people hate me for simply feeling the way I do, I’ve always felt this since childhood. I’ve attempted suicide at 15. I’ve been living since then simply for the sake of my parents, I told them how I felt, they said I’m mentally ill. I don’t want to transition I want to have been born a female.  Nothing I do can ever make me a biological female and I want to die because of it. I was also hurt as a child so maybe that’s apart of it."

"i told her about how lost i feel and how i will probably end my life next year because i'm tired of struggling but she just ignored it as if it was nothing. Now I feel both guilty and embarrassed. I try my level best to console her whenever she is feeling down, hype her up and ensure her that she is going to be fine but when I'm feeling vulnerable, I end up making her uncomfortable. It's not worth it to spend your energy loving someone. You'll end up hurt one way or the other. "

"So i have a new juicy story for y'all to gloat on &amp; wonder if i'm going to survive or not.

But first some back story.  
I met my friend in high school, he was always someone who no one could get along with and there were so many rumors going on about him at the time, that everyone pretty much warned me, don't go with this guy. For the sake of the story let's call him. Jake.

Despite the warnings, i still became friends with Jake, at the time i felt like he was misunderstood. But very blunt statements against women and racist jokes here &amp; there which i didn't tolerate. We were friends for over 6-7 years. He's also much older than i am. He's 29 and i'm 26. 

He knew i was dating several women from time to time on the internet &amp; i wanted to meet up with these people a couple of times. But it never worked out. Until the one from Poland came around. Now everything at first seemed to work out. Like she liked me, she liked Jake &amp; it was a good friend group that we had going. There were some isssues between her and Jake. But this also resolved later on in life. 

I formed a relationship with her. Let's call her Zoë. Psuedo names though. Not their real names. Zoë is specific because of a past friend of Jake, she looks like a Zoë he knows. So there's a bit of petty revenge there i guess. 

Zoë is a girl from poland who's strictly on meds. She has certain conditions for her mood etc.  
Depression and other stuff. Now I formed a relationship with her and the first week was smooth sailing until long story short my friend Jake. My best and only friend that i have. Is fucking Zoë and Zoë doesn't care.

Right in front of my eyes too. Like, I just fucking dropped a bomb. So to leave you with all the boring details. She's now with him. But her meds are still here &amp; boy, let me tell you.  
These meds are powerful, i can pretty much go into coma tonight. Because they're prescriptive meds from her doctor. 

I don't care what happens anymore, other than the fact i'll have a feast in heaven. By the revenge that is afterwards. I also can't take the pain, i'm weak for that. Besides, i also paid everything for her to even come to my place. Tickets, food, expenses everything. I'm livid. But i don't see a future without them. So i'm ending and hoping i can reincarnate for a better life. 

TLDR: Best &amp; only friend cheated on me with my gf. Gf has meds, i'll use for a trip to heaven. "
"I talked to my ex and told him I got raped last summer. I kept it to myself because I was so scared and disgusted with myself. When I finally did tell him, he basically told me I deserved it and hoes can’t get raped because it’s consensual. I’m so so hurt. My will to live is over."

"I am 30, female. I feel so childish for wanting to die. How silly is that? And like, knowing that other 30-something women are not typically as sad and lonely as I am just makes this even worse.

I don’t have a spouse or kids. I have struggled for over a decade to keep friends even though I desperately want them. I’ve had mostly sad, bad days since I was 18. My partner is long-distance. I really truly believe that the only people who would be affected by my death are my parents and my sister. For that reason, I can’t do it. And must live as an empty shell for the rest of my days. 

It’s hard to put into words what this is. I’m not not suicidal, but I also know it’s a boundary I am incapable of crossing, because of my immediate family. It’s strange. 

Just rambling…

Anyone like me?"
"I have come to the conclusion I can't kill myself and I hate it. I just can't bring myself to because of my family and honestly I'm a coward.

Everyone of my ""friends"" always leave me and start distancing themselves from me. I hate everything about me."

"I (22F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been together for almost a year. when we met eachother he was already in a bad place mentally, and it continues to get worse. he refuses to seek professional help as he doesn't have insurance, and is adamant that he doesn't want to tell his family or friends what is happening. every month or so it gets really bad, and he starts to say he is going to commit suicide. I have tried to help him find coping mechanisms, tell him how much I love him and everything he has to live for, but nothing seems to help. a few nights ago he broke down again, and ran out of the house with his keys. I was able to stop him before he left, but it's getting to the point where I am terrified to leave him alone and i feel like I can't go anywhere or do anything without him, because he might kill himself once im not next to him. we end up fighting a lot because he will pick fights, and last night he admited its because he is trying to get me to leave him so he can finally kill himself. I just feel so lost, and I just want to help him. 

Edit: Hi everyone. thank you all for the advice and well wishes, I really appreciate it. to add some context, he currently has two jobs and is a junior in college. we are both pursuing careers in the arts, and both of his jobs are stepping stone positions to his career goal. he takes pride in his work, but often feels undervalued and overlooked which is where a lot of this stems from. we've been working on going out and doing this more, we have movie dates twice a week, go out with friends, and we are huge comic book collectors and go to our shops every week. when he is staying active or busy, things are great. but once he is left alone, starts drinking, or something happens to set him off, he immediately falls back into the spiral. he has never been on medication, he has never seen a therapist, and he has not been diagnosed with anything. I hope this helps provide some more insight."

"I lost both my parents this month. My dad commited suicide by hanging 1 month ago and my mom couldn't live without him so she also commited suicide a week ago by jumping in front of the train. It's so hard without them, I don't understand how they could do such thing to me. We had such a great relationship and now they left me traumatized. Everyday It's so hard to accept that they're not here anymore and I keep hoping they would come back. I don't know what to do, I want to forget those images the way I've seen them for the last time in such horible state. What can I do? It's so hard, I feel this emptiness.  It feels like a nightmare. Why did this happened to me? I miss them so much...did somebody else went through something similar to me?"
i have come to realise that i use the idea of death and ending it all as a relaxing factor because the thought that there will come a day when the suffering will be over and i will at peace is so relieving. i hate this world i hate myself and i hate life so much. i don’t understand how people can have zeal and a will to live. i genuinely can’t understand it.

2 days ago i invited my ex bf over and i think that he raped me. i don’t want to say that and say that im a victim but idk what else to call it. we were having sex and it started to hurt really bad. i begged him to stop and he didn’t for what felt like more than an hour. i’ve been bleeding on and off ever since. my entire body is so fucking sore. all i’ve done is drink till i’m borderline blackout drunk so i don’t have to think about it so hard. i’m very very young and i have nobody to go to this about. 

while he was doing it he told me he loves me. and the worst part is that i said it back. we spent the entire next day together and i pretended like nothing happened. he was drunk enough to not remember most of the night. is there something wrong with me for wanting to see him again? idk if i’ve never been more sad and hurt in my entire life but i care about him. pls anyone reply i would really appreciate it "

I 19M was raped by my uncle through ages 5-12 and sexually assaulted by my older cousin through ages 13-17 I always thought it happened to females and only females I started acting feminine in my early teens year such as growing my hair out wearing skirts and crop tops painting my nails and wearing makeup my cousin and I’ve always had a feminine build and hobbies such as dance and doing nails and makeups generally sometimes I think my cousin would of never done it if I wasn’t feminine. It makes me wanna die the pressure to act masculine so it doesn’t happen again 
Fucking when? I have been trying for fucking years. Decades. Its never felt good. I HAVE WANTED TO FUCKING DIE FOR SO FUCKING LONG. How are you going to sit here and tell me it gets better??? You don't know shit.
"Dealt years with depression, boyfriend pulled me out of that miserable hole, only for my own stupidity to push me back down there again. I cheated on an exam and got caught. After the teacher kicked me out, I drove straight home and messaged my boyfriend goodbye, loved him, thanked him for everything. I have already decided that I needed to go, to get out, like the teacher said, and I texted my boyfriend I'll see him in the next life. 

But then he cried. When I answered his 15th call and stopped driving and did a full u-turn back to my university to go to him. I was being selfish indeed. He told me he'll never love anyone else after me. I mean he already lost enough people: his parents at an early age, his friend to suicide, and we really have some cozy plans for our future.

But I don't know anymore"
No one gives a shit about a suicidal person until they die and then if they commit suicide then they’re the selfish ones. This world is so fucked up
They don’t care. They laugh at you when you make a mistake. They say you should die because you’re weak. If they want me to die so bad then fine I’ll die. Because no one cares enough to want me around. I have memory problems and thinking issues and because of me making a mistake I’m worthless? I’m so mad I’m done with this. I’m done with crappy cruel people and this life. I’ve been nice to people and I’m stupid because I still care.. yet no one gives a crap and I can die right now .
"The US election is between an imbecile who can’t even form full sentences and an Oompa Lumpa who has been proven multiple times to be racist and sexist.

In the UK our ex Prime Minister literally was found breaking all the Covid rules that he himself set out. 

Western countries can’t even seem to agree on how many genders there are and how to define each one.

Eastern countries still seem to be living in the 19th century where women are second class citizens and slavery is ok.

Billionaires have the influence and money to make significant change yet not a single one of the 1000+ billionaires seem to be doing anything.

We still use the same justice system that protects the rich and doesn’t care about the poor.

We protect known rapists and murderers because they make good music or they act good, but will arrest some poor weed dealer who’s just trying to make a quick buck.

We are brought into this world against our will yet we aren’t allowed to leave it. It literally costs money to die. Like seriously someone who’s suicidal can die but then unknowingly bankrupt their family from doing so. 

We start wars over who’s religion is correct despite every religion being based around faith rather then evidence.

It’s almost funny how ridiculous life is. The only reason I’m personally not laughing is because I still have to endure like 50 more years of this shit.

"I'm bedridden &amp; disabled &amp; broke. My (young adult) son is my caregiver, and we are struggling to put food on the table daily - yet today I feel guilty for feeling overwhelmingly depressed about not being able to eat even a pizza from a restaurant for once, or hell- fast food! Pinching every penny, and today is nothing special. 

I'm also mourning the loss of what my disabilities have taken from me, and what my life should be now. I have an autoimmune liver disease, and am not a surgical candidate for a transplant, due to a previously botched abdominal surgery. I'm mad, depressed and exhausted.

"Anytime people talk about being suicidal people automatically assume they must be experiencing a deep, profound sadness. While this may be true for a large majority, I feel like the outlier here.

I’m tired of working a job I hate every single day because jobs in my field refuse to take a chance on me. I’m tired of putting so much effort into keeping myself alive with no reward for it. 

I have no hope that anything will ever get better. I think of killing myself everyday just so I can rest. I know that I will end up doing it eventually. I don’t want help.

"Day before yesterday, me and my gf went out drinking with a my gf's friends. Me and my gf came back to her place and we had sex and slept. 

Her friends said they might come to her place later in the night, from a different party, which they eventually did. They met this old fling of one of my gf's friend there and they invited him and his friend (let's call him 'x') along with them to my gf's place.

I was the one who opened the door for them, woke up my gf and we sat together and played cards for a while.

It was getting late, around 4am, my gf said she feels sleepy and asked me to come to the bedroom with her and sleep. I wanted to have a smoke before going to the bed that day and went to the balcony to have my smoke. 

It would have been barely 5 mins and when I went back to the bedroom, I saw my gf and this guy x were making out and were undressing each other. I was so taken aback. I really didn't know what to do or how to do anything.

I felt little, disrespected, furious, low and sick to the stomach. Me and my gf are in a relationship for about 3 years now. I have never done anything even so small that will hurt her. Just earlier that evening she was telling me that she was thinking about us getting married and the prospect of it.

I just left her house and went to mine at 4am and I couldn't even sleep. She called me later in the morning and asked why I left. I told her that you cheated on me openly and that's why. She is saying that we were all so drunk that night and she wasn't in control of what was happening and that was the reason and she is sorry for it. I can't take this as answer. Never

I feel the lack of taking responsibility even more disrespectful of me. I feel little and ashamed. I feel like I should not exist just to stop feeling like this. I have never even forced her to do anything if she didn't feel like doing it. But she goes on cheating and brushes it off. I had to attend a wedding today. But I have skipped it and don't have any energy to do shit. I am just lying on my bed since this incident. I can't even say this to anyone, since I feel ashamed and feel like a loser"
"For me... currently it's financial issues.. this is the lowest I've ever been, car got repossessed today, I can't even go do a ton of doordash to pick myself back up.. I don't often think of ending myself but when I'm sick to where I can barely work, stand up for long periods due to heart failure, I just can't help but think.. if I were presented an opportunity, would I take it? And what opportunities would I consider? It's possible I'm going to be evicted tomorrow as well.. no car to prepare with, no money to do anything.. my heart feels like it's going to burst from all the stress.. how does one go about getting help with all this? Because not being alive anymore seems like a rather sane option.. to not have to worry about this shyt anymore.. even if I do somehow get money to keep going, my health is rapidly deteriorating. Is life even worth it anymore when you're too sick to enjoy it?"
"I am an Indian Muslim woman. I hate my parents. I don't even want to call them that. They constantly abuse me, berate me, for the littlest things. They just won't let me be. They are never satisfied, and I don't think they will ever be satisfied until they have succeeded in pushing me over the edge. 

I don't really want to do this. I tried once (actually twice), and it wasn't a pleasant experience. But I don't know how much longer I am supposed to just take it all. I am tired of being the family punching bag. They like to pretend they are so benign. They think they have done me such a huge favour by ""letting"" me get an education. I would like to throw it back in their faces by dying so horribly that they never forget it. I am allowed nothing. If I go out, that is if I am ever allowed to go out, it is under a thousand restrictions. 

I am constantly being threatened with forced marriage. I hate them so much, I don't know how long I can go without trying to kill them. I thought I could get more time to prepare for an escape from this, but even now I am being threatened with forced marriage. I am at the end of my rope. I tried slitting my wrist today. I did research all day, then I tried slitting my wrist for like 2 hours straight but it didn't go anywhere deep. I don't know what to do. I will slitting again, but I am considering getting in an accident or something. I didn't want that, but I don't see a lot of options."
"So am getting a divorce and my ""friend"" wanted to got out drinking because she just broke up with her boyfriend. Well we went out and she proceeds to flirt with everyone then talked shit about me called me hideous and worthless. She battered me to the point of tears worst part not single person even tried to help me for certain reason I couldn't leave so for 3 hours I had to be treated like dirt and I can't take it anymore anyone I let get close to me hurts me I can't do it anymore "
"

I (20M) graduated high school in 2020. I have been trying to apply for universities around the world to escape the shithole I am living in. This journey of constant waiting and anxiety was extremely daunting. It lasted three years and it made my life hell. Not knowing whether you'll get some education to at least have a better life was brutal. Anyways, this journey ended some months ago, but my mind just enjoys feeling anxious.

I'll be going to a pretty good university in the middle east. The problem is, even though the universty is good and all, it will be absolutely hard to get a job in this country because the economy is completely destroyed. So my anxiety of leaving a yet another shithole continues. My studeis didn't start yet, but I am sure that if I want to have a job or get a PhD in a first world country, I will have to work harder than ever.

Yesterday I was sleeping thinking of all the adversity awaiting me, when I realized that committing suicide should be my way to go if I failed.

Before, I was religious, and in my religion killing yourself is a sin and you'll go straight to hell. But now, after knowing that suicide is finally available, I slept peacefully. If I fail, I can just simply stop trying.

Finally taking it easy."

I hope this is the right thing to say to them. Anything I can say to make sure they are okay?
This was really hard to write. It all just kinda seeped out. It's hard when you can't say anything to the people around you. Fearful of how they will react or what they will say. Scared of rejection. I wish I could talk to the people I loved b4 going but it's safer to just leave a note.

Honestly I'm kinda of scared. But I know this is the right decision. It been too long.


Edit #1 I'm still here. Didn't have the balls to do it. I tried but I couldn't make myself do it. I don't want to die a failure. I want to die as something remembered.
Anyway just wanted to say thanks for all of your lovely messages. It really helped make me feel something.

Edit #2 I deleted my suicide note. I don't want them to find it. I want it to still be special and theirs when I eventually go.
I'm doing okay rn. Still really struggling trying to get through each day.
Thanks for all of you. It helped."
Nothing hurts more than your suicide attempt not working and now you’re stuck in the hospital I feel so defeated and depressed because I wanted to die😭😭
"My sister allowed me to use her backpack for some weird festival, and while I was clearing it I saw a journal. In the moment I thought it would be funny to read but then I read a few of the pages and they mentioned suicidal ideation. Apparently, she had had multiple pill overdose attempts and had relapsed(with cutting, presumably). She’s in sixth grade and we have a close age gap, and honestly I don’t know what the fuck to do. She’s pretty much my twin, my other half, and the entries consistently drew upon how she couldn’t wait for her suicide and couldn’t take it anymore. In the past, I had issues with self harm and suicide attempts and I fear that I rubbed off on her. She’s the type to deflect any serious conversation, and our sibling bond relies purely on jokes; I don’t think I can bring it up with her. She’s way too young for this shit and I don’t know I’m just crazy scared and I don’t know how to bring it up. I don’t think she realises how much I need her in my life and how much she means to me. Any advice would be appreciated because I really do not want to lose her."

"Stop thinking you can do anything. Stop it. You aren’t shit. You can easily be replaced by anyone. Nobody needs nor wants you. You don’t even want yourself. You want to die. You want to die. You want to die. You’re just too much of a worthless sack of shit to actually go through with it. You wanted to be rich so that you can support your family. HA!!! You can’t even hold one. You’ve been jobless for over 3 years and still can’t change anything. You are such a pathetic loser. Why would anyone want anything to do with you. Your mom should seriously give up on your sorry as and kick you out of the house. Maybe you’d actually go throwing killing yourself. Stay a broke, pathetic little boy. You aren’t a man. Not only are you skinny, 5’9ft and broke, but you are also emotional. Just end it you sorry excuse of a human being 

Edit:

This is suppose to be to me; not you. I’m basically talking to myself. I’m sorry to anyone that may have thought I was speaking to the people that browse this subreddit.

Edit 2: 

Should I be scared? Why are so many of you somewhat feeling the same way? I promise this was just me saying what was on my head these past few days. I just don’t get it anymore…

Edit 3:

So I was banned for a while for a misunderstanding of breaking rule 1. Fortunately, I’ve been brought back after appealing that I did not. Again, and I can’t express this enough, this is a post about ME; not anyone else. If you have any relations to my own feelings, please don’t do what I do. Ultimate it’s your decision as to what you do from here on, but don’t let my post about myself, be the reason you come to a conclusion on your life. Even though I feel this way about myself and my life, I still think life itself is beautiful and could never be nihilistic to it. Myself is another story, as I just don’t care about myself anymore and feel those ways for a long time. I’m sorry if anyone has felt a certain way from reading my post. I may not post here anymore or at least for a few months. If you DO feel like me right now, all I can say is to try and be kinder to yourself. We all have things we hate about ourselves and wish we can change. We can’t change everything, but try to be ok with your flaws and strive to change what you can if at all possible. I’m a hypocrite, but I do believe others can do what I couldn’t. See ya for now"
"I tried posting this in the ""Too Afraid to Ask"" subreddit but it got removed. Everyone is familiar with the adage of suicide being ""a permanent solution to a temporary problem,"" but what if the issue  is perpetual and lifelong? There isn't a cure or remedy for every problem in existence. Isn't it possible that some people feel like they themselves are the issue, and not some temporary circumstance that will pass? Take me for example. I believe that my brain is so fundamentally flawed that I simply do not deserve to exist as I am. Some people are unfortunately inferior human beings and I am one of them. I strongly suspect that I have some form of neurodivergence that causes me to function ""differently"" from the norm.

But that's the thing. The way my brain is wired is what has plagued me for my entire life. I have very little common sense because of it. I have no social skills because of it. I'm not ""all there"" because of it. You would expect a brain with a ""different"" wiring to to at least have some strengths associated with it, but my performance is very poor to mediocre at best at everything I do. I just simply don't function adequately enough to be capable of getting and keeping a decent job or having a relationship.

I realize now that this is both a question and a personal rant in one, but aren't there plenty of problems that aren't temporary?"
"can’t stand people who say this, but the “other way out” is never mentioned. what is the way out then???? am i genuinely stupid i don’t get this"
"Experiences of these places is not universal, and I know my experience was probably better than average. I managed to get out quick by being ""The perfect patient."" 

I expressed so many times that my anxiety and autism made a ward a bad place for me. I was overloaded, more overwhelmed, and more stressed than when I came in. No help was offered, no activities were on, it was short staffed. 

Yes, they could watch me every hour to check I'm not killing myself, but if I ever was in a low place again, the fear of returning to a place like this (Or worse) would make me extremely reluctant to ask for help, which seems really counter-productive. 

So the question is, how do I get help if I am suicidal? If I try to get help and I am not suicidal, I just get put on massive waiting lists and don't actually receive any help"
"I was waking home from school and tripped pretty bad I scuffed up my knee and hand and it was right in front of a group of girls who don’t like me, they asked if i was okay whilst obviously sniggering to their mates about it and i sat up and said i’m ok and ran off as fast as possible but I’m so embarrassed I hate myself so much. I usually stay pretty under the radar from literally everyone but i’m so embarrassed and they weren’t the only people who saw loads of people did. I get embarrassed so easily  but this has to be the most embarrassing thing to ever happen to me. As soon as I got home I cried to my step dad and my mum about how embarrassed I was i literally started having a panic attack. God I hate everything so much.

Edit: Thanks for everyone being so kind lol😭 I know this seems like a massive overreaction but I have anxiety and have been bullied at school for as long as I remember so yeah maybe it’s only something small like tripping up but that to me is the end of the world, I immediately think the worst and end up having a panic attack, I do it with literally everything sometimes even coughing. Also ppl telling me to suck it up it’s also kinda helpful bc it makes me feel better knowing that it’s rlly not that deep. And I have depression so this isn’t like the first time I’ve ever wanted to kill myself, so it’s not that big of a deal."
"why is so fucking hard for people to get this through their heads. ""you're lazy!!"" yeah no shit. life is fucking torment and I don't want to do it.

"
Literally title. ""Go out do what you like"" ignoring every problem with that sentence, why? To chase possible happiness, when I can get guaranteed peace in death?

So, tell me, why should I or anyone else stay alive, if once we die it's all gone, and staying alive hurts?"

I don't even know why I am writing this right now. I feel defeated.

I found out I am pregnant. I'm 29. Bf of 1.5 years is 30. Two days later he left me, told me he didn't want to be with me, or have a baby and just abandoned me.

I am devastated. I don't have any family for support. Almost no friends.

I can’t believe I’m living in the same reality as some people sometimes. I’m 22f and I get the job market is tough but it’s really scary how people let the ingrained competitiveness remove any drive to form genuine connections.

To the two/three people online who I look up to and listen to every night, I’m sorry I disturbed you. I’ll make it up to you. I love you guys. And to my friends and family, I’m sorry I had to hurt you like this, but I had no choice, I had to escape. I really wish I could’ve lived longer but it’s what fate led me to, I guess. I have no other place to go to feel safe. I’m sorry for everything and every bad thing I’ve caused. And to my mother, this is mostly because of you.

why? Alot frankly, I have been groomed multiple times in my life and was raped by my ex for  a  year, with my current partner sexually exploiting me too.   
My family have always been emotionally andd verbally abusive, threatening to disown me for any action they did not like, for eg me speaking before I was spoken to. my family will always argue which raised me to have terrible anger issues, these issues then pushed away all my friends as I genuinely do not know how to respond  to emotions, so ill just blame, scream, and cry, meaning besides my exploitive  ex, I have no one.   
I was bullied and ostrasiced from every circle as a child, which did not help my issues, however its not fair to blame kids/ teens for any of this.   
I am mentally  unable to work or function due to things like ADHD, however  due to my family not allowing me  medication nor therapy,  it is not gettinng better.  
ontop of this I am trans, a minor note but the dysphoria hurts, extremely bad, my family makes a note to put me down over it

I have nothing left, I love this world, and I want to  see people happy. However I do not, and have never caused joy nor happiness.

I just want someone to remember me, I can give more context + information in a couple hours, if anyone replies

  
but I  cannot live as a bad person  anymore, and being physiically unable to get help makes my situation impossible

"maybe I've seen too much gore, stayed too long on the internet. but either way I've realized, after seeing animals disembowel and eat eachother, humans tie eachother up set someone on fire, a child running into traffic and getting split in half, a woman's face get cut in half, a crocodile eat a dog and a man, rape, torture, murder, cannibalism- every single living thing is fucking vile and our inherent nature, our bodies meat and blood, its all just pain and death for the benefit of some other life. and then that life will die too, of disease or anything else.

there's no purpose. it really is just kill or be killed as much as we try to deny it. I don't want to live in a place like this. I don't want to eat anymore.

"So yesterday I went to Walmart and successfully bought a bottle of Ibuprofen without my mom finding out. It’s currently hidden in a drawer in my room. On Tuesday after I get home from morning tutoring, I am going to take the entire bottle. It’s 100 200mg pills, so it’ll be 20,000mg of ibuprofen at once. I’m not sure what’s going to happen, and a large part of me is terrified, but I know that this needs to happen. 

I mainly hate lying to my mom. That entire time we were at Walmart yesterday, I had the bottle hidden in my purse and I just felt awful having to act like nothing was wrong the rest of the day. Then at work last night I had absolutely no motivation, and I’m sure I won’t again tonight. I hate having to act happy today, since it’s Easter. I wish I could tell my mom she didn’t have to buy all that candy, because I’ll never get a chance to eat it. 

A lot of you think I should stay for my mom, and well, I understand why, but I’ve been doing that for the past 8 years, and nothing has gotten better for me. I’m sick and tired of waiting and waiting for things to change, but they never seem to do. The worst part about this is doing this to her, because the last thing I want to do is put my pain on her. But at the same time I feel I’ve run out of options. Maybe it’s selfish, well, it is selfish. But I’ve always been a selfless person, so why can’t I be selfish for one time in my life? All I can do is hope she’ll be okay in the long run. She has my brother, her sister, her mom. She has people that I know will support her through this and give her a reason to keep going. Just like she did for me these past 8 years. 

Also, to the people saying it’s not worth it because of the agony it may put me through, I don’t care. I’m in enough mental agony that physical won’t even be much harder. And at least for that time I’ll be focused on that instead of my dark thoughts. And if I live, and it messes my body up, I mean, my mind is already messed up, so what’s so bad about my body getting messed up, too? Not like I have a good life ahead of me, if any.

"My older brother ended his life. May 17th, 2024.

He was 31 years old with two beautiful girls ages 6-8 and a partner who cared for him even though they both had their flaws.

My brother wasn't a perfect man, far from it.

But he was a man I loved dearly.

A man a lot of people loved.

His kids especially.

I am struggling. 

I am so hurt. 

And I have to keep it together because my fiancée is 6 months pregnant and can not be stressed.

She was hospitalized today with early contractions.

My baby. My fiancée. My brother.

I feel so heavy with the weight of this, and I haven't been able to breathe.

It has been non-stop for me. 

Being a good partner and being a dad to our 4-year-old.

Being there for my brother's kids and partner.

Being there for my mom and my twin and sister.

Having to dealwith lawyers and coroner's and the police and the funeral home and trying to access his place to gather his belongings, the pound to get his dogs and explaining over and over and over again to people who are reaching out.

Cooking, cleaning, working.

I haven't slept much.

Everyone keeps needing something.

And I keep giving.

But I am tired.

My soul is tired.

I am hurt.

And I can't grieve because I need to be strong.

I can't breakdown yet.

But I will.

"Picking up a gun later this week likely. I've realized over time that the only truly painless way to die would be to blow my head off. Nothing left. With hanging, you choke or break your neck and die. With drugs, you'll likely just end up getting very sick and throwing up. Jumping off a bridge? I'll be scared the whole way down.

But a gun? I get to just pull a trigger, and bam. Black. I'm honestly excited.

Just gotta make sure to aim it correctly so I don't end up one of those misfigured freaks. I'll probably just stand by a body of water so if the shot somehow doesn't kill me I'll drown while unconscious. 

Sorry mom, sorry dad. Sorry to everyone. I just can't deal with this shit anymore. I'll be remembered as the lazy chump who blew his head off. I have a lot of regrets, yeah, but I don't really have any big achievements either. I am the literal definition of a loser and not much of value will be lost.

Everybody ends up as just a number anyways. It was always going to end this way.

Edit :- Ironic that mods removed the reply of the one person who tried to help, but kept the reply of the AH who was telling me to ""stop complaining and bring change through online means"". 
Edit 2: Just wanna thank the mods for removing that comment I talked about!"
"(F14)I have completely given up on my life, my best friend that is 15 and i met him in clinic also committed suicide 2 months ago and it still hurts so bad. Im in so much mental pain and i have been to a few mental hospitals and closed wards yet nothing helps. My therapists are giving up on me and im set all on myself now. I cant take this anymore, im all ready to go tonight.

I wish you all a good life incase im going tonight, goodbye

Edit: 
I was standing at the bridge for a while, i had a breakdown and beat and hurt myself at home bc i was so mad at myself for not jumping. I have to unalive myself this month tho, if i dont then police will pick me up and send me to the mental hospital again. Mental hospitals make everything worse, they trigger me and just make more trauma."
"I just don’t GET IT. When I embarrassingly failed my drivers test, I instantly thought of overdosing as soon as I got home. I might fail my first class ever and get my financial aid rejected, and am thinking of jumping off a parking structure. Every time I look in my bank account and my credit score, I just think of legally buying a gun and shooting myself. I just got out of the hospital and got prescribed a bottle of 800MG of ibuprofen and my first thought is wow, this would kill me if I just downed it instantly. How do I make it stop bro "
"That's it. Simple. I have yet to find a single ""success story"" for anyone in my situation.

I don't know why I keep trying and haven't successfully killed myself yet. The chances of me getting out of this shit situation is abysmal, even if I do everything right. Social skills are the most important trait to have as a human being. If you do not have them you are worthless, and you can't do anything about that.

I tried pretending. It made no difference. 

I will die broke, friendless, alone, and miserable because I have poor communication skills and creep everybody out. "
"This would literally be my dream come true. I get this odd sense of jealously when I hear people get told that they only have a certain amount of time left to live. Like why couldn't it have been me???

I'm way too much of a coward to end my own life so l wish the universe would do it and put me out of my misery :/ but I guess l'm not that lucky😢"
I'm sad I feel like I'll never get a girlfriend what do I do everyone judges me based on the way I look girls care about looks so much even it doesn't last 
"I'm 28F and I harmed ms again two days ago. A psychiatrist told me once that I shouldn't do it because ""I'm not 18 anymore"". I feel ashamed, I'm so embarrassed.

Edit : thank you for all your responses 🌹 I forgot to mention that she's not my psychiatrist anymore. Nevertheless words like those stuck in my mind when I feel depressed..."
"Like what....

Imagine being sexually desired. Lol. "
"I always loved my mom, since I was a child I would always stay with her, all the time. Two days ago tho, my mom noticed a stain on my pants, the part of the pants where my vagina is, and she just- she touched it with her finger, poked it, not only that but this made me realize how uncomfortable I am with my mom, she's way too open around me, telling me my boobs are growing, literally taking of her clothes in front of me and much much more. I love my mom, SHE IS THE PERSON I ALWAYS TRUSTED, I ALWAYS TALKED TO HER, GOT HER INTO MY INTERESTS, I LOVE MY MOM, I CAN'T DO THIS, AM I INSANE?"
"One of my ""friends"" screamed at me because I said I was suicidal, saying that ""people have it worse,"" that he has it worse, that XYZ person has it worse. I'm tired of people who make it into a competition of who has the worst trauma/ depression/ whatever.

Anyone who is thinking about ending their life obviously is in a bad place, or else suicide wouldn't cross their mind. Who is anyone else to judge another person's situation unless they've lived a day in that person's life and know the physical and mental torture the suicidal person goes through everyday?

Does anyone else experience yelling, insults, and abusive behavior whenever the topic of suicide is brought up?

Also, ""worse"" is a subjective term. I could go to a less developed country such as Thailand or Vietnam and live a minimal lifestyle (one room, one suitcase, etc.) but have access to beautiful beaches and nature. Some people would consider that to be a ""worse"" reality than living in a standard first world capitalist country with a bigger living space and more material items. 

I'm sick of being treated this way just because I struggle mentally, and it just pushes me over the edge, and I don't know what to do. Please help."
"I hate this world as a black woman. 
This is my experience (i know there will be woman who will come down my throat saying they havent expereinced this)

Iam never the preference. Always last choice, after all the girls they chase after reject them, they come to us to try and use our bodies and throw us away. I was bullied relentless by boy in school because of the complexion of my skin, i was always told i was ugly. Even now in adulthood black men are never interested in me. I always see them oogle at other women, approach them and flirt with them. Yet ive never had a black guy flirt with me in my LIFE and im in my 20s.

I can count on less than one hand how many times ive actually had a conversation with a black guy. When i try to be friendly they are aloof and standoffish. The only black men that are open are the elderly and they just want to use me for sex.

With other ethnicities, they see me as something to try out. A fetish. They dont see me as human.

Im sick of people saying friendships and relationships are easier for women becaus i have never had that experience.

I have attempted suicide multiple times due to having no one to talk to in real life. No one to have genuine close conversations with.

I haven't had a proper conversation in over a year. Im sick of existing.

Also helath care professionals dont take me seriously, they dismiss me. I've had to fight so hard just for anyone to listen to my basic needs"

Once she kick the bucket I'ma say fucket and jump in front of a car or train. I don't care how selfish it is cuz no one cared about me. I'm done I hate going from job to job I hate being a black man because of what I deal with in America. I hate politics. I hate not being good enough for women. I hate life I hate God id rather go to hell then be lonely. I tried therapy and meds for a decade. I hate bipolar and depression. I hate myself I'm worthless. 
Everything is just too much. I'm too lazy and sensitive. I'm unable to get a simple job. Even the easiest jobs are too much for me. I'm just unable to do anything with life. Me being born was a mistake and I hate that my parents had me. My only fate is to kill myself. It's not a matter of if but when. 
"Im a 19-years old international student in the UK, came back to my home country for a while but thing hasn't changed. I suffered from depression and gambling addiction which led to me lose everything. Funds that father sent to me to pay tuition fee and accommodation were used to gamble for my self-happiness although I just simply lost it all. Hate to say that it was wrong but it was the only way I can escape from reality. Grandfather that I love most recently passed away and all these responsibilities that I have to carry is too much for me. After tonight, this will be my last message  before I'm going to end it all by the time you are reading this. Just have no hope of living anymore although i was born into high-income family but I wish I could just be happy and not alone. Never been loved by parent or friends, have no passion on life anymore. I used to have a dream to become successful billionaire but i dont know what got into me. I've been thinking about this for few months and i think it's time after i lost all the money (30,000£ to be exact) and I have lost it to trading forex before which was more than now but still, a perfect time to escape reality and problems. Wish I could born to be  loved in next life

I'm lazy to write anymore

Goodbye



*Update* 20/9/24
Im speechless, just incredibly surprised by the amount of support and guidance provided by you guys who don't even know me personally (first time using reddit and im very thankful of how anonymous people from around the world could save someone's life)
Today, I was feeling a bit better after reading all of the comment and 5 hours ago my mom who I truly care the most and the only person I would live for, she saw the emptiness in my eyes and it was the first time I openly confessed about my struggle of depression and addiction to gambling at young age. Although my father disagreed and said that it's just a hallucination created by my own-self. However, this is the first time that my mom asked me one-on-one that ""Are you okay?"" as I always pretended to be strong in-front of my parent (asian's family thing). After I heard that, I broke down in tears and confessed that I really need help. We had a long conversation until I realized that the live I'm living for if not for myself, I will fight for my parent who've been fighting for me since young age. Even my father who is a bit old-headed but at the end he realized how vulnerable I am right now and has helped me to cover the loss that I regrettably made. Currently, I will be taking a therapist session to help me cope with depression and gambling addiction problem, although, I still can't find the passion that I used to have but hopefully one day I will be happy again.

Thank you guys for all the support, this actually helped me a lots as I don't really have closed friends to openly have a conversion like this"
"Greatest sexual fantasy ever I am not trying to but I only ever feel good when I have fantasies about self mutilation and blood strangling myself being beaten and raped being killed tortured it's the thing I fantasise about the most and that I want the most to be beaten to death being burned alive 
I literally get sexual attraction to suicide it's the only way I can cope by fantasising about death attempts have been made to end this life but none successful so far I wonder how I will die I wish to die soon all I ever wanted is to die"
"Hi I'm a 15 year old boy and struggling with gender dysphoria, I wish I was a girl, I'm planning on killing myself really soon, in like 2 days if I have the chance, I hate my body and I'll never be a girl, I hate my penis and my masculine features, I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack because I'm gonna have to live with this for the rest of my life, I dispise everything about being male, I really wish I was female, it's not fair. I don't really want to accept the fact that I'm a boy and I want to kill myself to make this all go away, I feel like I'm having some sort of crisis and I don't know what to do."
"I've been on my period for 6 months and it's so fucking heavy. I couldn't deal with it anymore so I made an appointment with a gyno, but I don't want to go. I've never beeen because I don't want to be feeled up and have fingers and medical instruments showed inside me. I'm asexual, I'm repulsed by my fucking vagina. I'd rather have a brain tumor and die, but of course I have to deal with this awful and disgusting thing. Maybe I have cancer and I'll die in a couple of months and be done with this fucking shitty life. If I had a gun I'd shot myself. Nothing esle seems as sure as a gun and I don't want to fail. I don't have enough strong medicine at home. I'd jumpt in front of train, but I'm too fat. Crashing my car into a cement wall on a highway seems like a good idea, but I'd probably survive because nothing ever goes my way. "
"Everyone around me keeps telling me that my life is not that bad, and that I'm too young to be suicidal, and I'm just so done with this. 
I was SA'd when I was 14 by an 70+ years old dude who drugged me. It kills me because the only person who ever loved my body was him. No soap will ever clean me. 
My own sister tried to sell me for drugs, yet no one takes me seriously about it. A guy wanted to pay me 10K just to take my virginity away, and she just said ""Omg do it that's so much money! Think about all the pills we could pop!"" And when I speak up about it ""Yeah but you could've gotten high from it too."" I was dying man. I spent 6 days straight on meth not sleeping, not eating. And it's not that I wasn't hungry, but my mom was too busy doing coke herself at her boyfriend's house that she couldn't be bothered sending us 10$ to atleast get bread or soup.
I wanna be like the other 15yo girls, but I'll never be. 'Cause I'm not even a girl anymore. Just some kind of experiment for the others to enjoy...

But that's nothing? Dude if it gets any worse when I grow up, might as well end it all now.
I'm tired of surviving and for what?...I just wanna live.
"
I'm scared.  I know I need help but I'm scared they will put me in a ward and I want to tell my therapist but she will have to report it and I nobody I can tell.
"I still want it to end. Not a day has gone by in those years where I haven't considered it at least once. It's only a matter of time before I actually do it, I bought the rope a while back, so now all it takes is one really bad day and i'm gone. My only regret is being born at all. I'm so tired of hearing how things get better when they clearly haven't. When is the ""get better"" part? Decades from now?"
Why do they ask? I'm not going to tell them I'm having suicidal thoughts; I know how they operate. 
"im a 17yo autistic pathetic girl who is also
A lesbian. I’ve talked to so many women now and it’s clear that there is something about me that makes everyone walk away. I get so fucking attached, and they walk away. I’m the problem. I tried to be social I tried to get a fucking life and failed. The only thing left is me, so I have to kill myself. I always dreamed about growing old with a wife and live on a farm. Turns out that’s never going to happen. There is something inherently wrong with me and I have to disappear. The cutting doesn’t help anymore no matter how deep I go. There’s only one cure."
"On Friday night my parents caught me watching porn, and exactly like the title says I wanna kill myself. It’s an addiction I’ve had for around a year, already kinda wanted to die because of it, after my parents caught me I tried to talk to them about it and tell them it’s something I’ve been struggling with, rather than trying to help/support me they just keep screaming at me for how I’m such an awful person now. I’m a fairly devoted Christian, that’s about the only thing stopping me from suicide. That’s why I already hated myself for watching porn and being addicted, it’s extremely against the Bible and I couldn’t quit. Don’t really know where I was going with this, just kinda ranting, sorry for making you read such a dumb post but yea I’m debating suicide and whether I’d rather give up my faith and kms or try to stick it out and figure out what to do

Edit: wanna clarify, my parents are not Christian’s. I am for reasons you all would probably call me an idiot for lol. But, I’m glad I posted, I’ve realized I should quit worrying so much about what my parents (who have abused me my whole life) think, and that it might not be normal for your own parents to make you suicidal as often as my parents do"
"They hear a gunshot and burst into my room screaming as they see brain matter pouring out in my final moments. Bet they’ll regret how they treated me then.  

I know I’m not important enough for this, but I pray my suicide gets on the news somehow too and all of my bullies and the people who wronged me will see it. May record it too so it can get on those youtube channels, get everyone talking about it so everyone can see it. They’ll probably feel bad then. Maybe not. "

"Please please please please please make it end please im begging on my knees kill me. I can’t believe what I’ve become. i am actually insane, i cried for 3 hours in a row today at the beach at night rolling on the sand just crying and crying non stop 
I lost my voice 
I can’t speak because i was crying at the top of my lungs. 
People often ask me if im drunk because I always act weird 
I act weird because I’m at the lowest I’ve ever legitimately been, I’m experiencing the most soul crashing mental breakdown in my entire life 
And it just keeps getting worse 
The mental hospital didn’t help 
Meds don’t help 
Therapist doesn’t help 
My life is over 
Existing is a torture
I can’t do this anymore i am destroyed completely 
Im broken
I am actually dead i feel like a ghost that is just floating around on earth watching others living the life 
While im invisible, alone and dead
I only hear and see the life that i was supposed to be a part of 
Im not a part of society 
Im nothing just complete waste of life"
"Even though I've been having suicidal thoughts as of late, I never really acted on them.

Until yesterday.

I was going to hang myself, but I chickened out last minute because I was scared of the pain. I want to die but I'm too scared of the pain I have to go through to actually kill myself. I'm ashamed of myself. Too much of a pussy to stand up to others, and too much of a pussy to withstand any pain."
"After years of abuse, after taking care of adults instead of them taking care of me, after being neglected, after being in so much pain, I think it is finally time to say goodbye. May the sun shine on your face, may you see pretty butterflies on your walks, may all your dreams come true. :)"
"A month ago me and my now ex had a miscarriage, she apparently broke up with me immediately which was never conveyed to me, and now she's fucking her best friend from 6th grade 3 weeks later. She never wants to see me again yet apparently I didn't do anything wrong. My life's been shit sure I've got a new truck and a decent job, but even all that can't bring my family back. My mom tried to kill herself on my birthday when I was 7 and willingly gave my dad custody. I've been cheated on at the end of all my relationships or left for someone else but all I get is a idk when I ask why. And the only condolences I get is God has a plan what fucking plan is that? What fucking plan is that? Make me miserable? Can I just not have a stable relationship and not have to hide shit from the rest of my family why do I have to smile for others why can't I tell the rest of the family what happened I'm sad. Why can I be sad. I just want my baby back that's all I want I want my baby back I feel betrayed by my ex so now I sit here alone with nothing and work in the morning. I want to hold my ex and my kid that's all I want I put so much work in and now I have nothing.  
"
"I’ve posted on multiple forums on different accounts and most people told me that I would regret killing myself and things would get better. They did not. I got humiliated in front of my high school. My parents actually hate me now and both of my grandparents, the two people who would never judge me have died in a car crash. I’m done. I’m killing myself no matter what. It’s either killing myself or just rot in my room for the rest of high school. I’ll probably do the latter because im too much of a bitch to kill myself. If anybody is willing to sell me a gun that would be greatly appreciated. I want to use a gun because then it’s the simple act of pulling the trigger and then I don’t get a chance to regret it, or pussy out. "
"I am a south korean and I'm 27 years old.

I just want to... write something on the internet... to be remembered by...

I've always been taught by my country's culture, and by extension, the world, that I am a worthless man.I've been taught that I am too short, too poor and too stupid to deserve anything good.I've been taught that I am a worthless, boring, mediocre man that only deserve 8 to 6 jobs with painfully low minimum wage (less than 24,000 Dollars a year).

I once injured my arm from one of my job... and you know what they did?They just fired me without compensation that they were legally obligated to pay.

I was always suicidal, I took ADHD pills and anti-depressants.It felt like I was just walking corpse on auto-pilot, doing same dog shit jobs over and over again just to put money on the table.

I had hobbies, though.I did boxing and archery.

I lived like that until I am 27 years old (I am still 27).But I met someone very special almost two years ago...She taught me that I am someone worthy of friendship, affection and care.She got into a relationship with someone else better than me, but I had no problem with that and I remained as her friend, and I was satisfied with it.

That is until I fucking heard she passed away...  I didn't even get to say goodbye to her...That kind of broke me... It felt like this world just kept taking whatever little stuffs I had left...It was around last June that I decided to kill myself but I didn't want to do it in a small bathroom or inside a car...

So.... I went to Norway hahaha!My logic was that, if I was going to die, I want to spend some good quality time traveling to a country I always loved, and die gloriously.I bought a plane ticket to Norway, I bought a box cutter knife and rented a car, and I just traveled around Norway for like a week.I spent all my life savings + credit card for this, too.

I arrived at Oslo first, visited various tourist attractions.Then I went to Geiranger, then Loen, and then Jotunheimen.I think I visited most of the ""must visit"" tourist attractions that internet suggested.

After all that, I arrived at my final destination, Leirvassbu in Jotunheimen.I felt so lucky that they had spare rooms hahaha.I spent a lovely night in there... I almost forgot how beautiful the natural darkness can be...The next morning, I walked inside Jotunheimen with no map and no food.I didn't plan to return...

I also went out of my way to enter into ""non-walkable area"" where grounds were nothing but sharp big rocks and mudds and rivers, and I injured my self all the way down.

When I thought I had found my perfect resting spot, I tried to slit my wrist with the box cutter knife... but turns out a box cutter knife is not capable of cutting through flesh easily.I tried to cut my wrist for like 20 minutes, and all it did was leave small marks on my left wrist.

I had no choice but to return to the hotel but it was already 6PM by the time I decided to walk back and it was the most exhausting and painful walk (and crawling and climbing) I've ever done in my life.My body was literally running on adrenaline hahahaha.

It was probably around 12AM that I miraculously found a god damn trail... a human trail... a FUCKING walkable road... and I eventually started seeing lights from the hotel.When I arrived at the door step, I momentarily collapsed, and when I entered the hotel, I kind of broke down crying.Hotel staffs fed me, talked to me, and overall was very nice to me.There was this guy Henric, a clerk, that chose to talk to me for like 4 hours talking about different stuffs.

Unfortunately, hotel staffs called 9/11 and I was hospitalized against my will.My memories after entering Ambulance is quite fuzzy due to drugs the EMTs gave me.

I was stuck in a mental hospital 1~2 hours away from Oslo.I don't know where exactly that was, I never bothered to check the location.But I do remember the doctor's name, His name was Alexander (I think).

To be honest, I don't remember much of what happened inside the hospital, but I do remember being bitter and resentful that the 9/11 was called and that I was not allowed to leave the hospital for almost like a week.

I remember talking to bunch of nurses about my inner thoughts, my motivations and what not.I didn't like that they kept opening the door of my room every 1 hour and took away my belongings.It was a vicious cycle... They would ask me ""Do you want to kill yourself?"" and I would say ""Yes"" and then they would keep me few more days until I had to verbally say ""No, I don't want to kill myself"" despite wanting to kill myself.

And all of that only strengthened my belief that I am a mere corporate/government property destined to work dog shit jobs until I die of old age.

Eventually, they called South Korean embassy, I was expecting some sort of punishments but... they took care of the flight ticket back home.It was dreadful coming back... that was not my plan and I had no money left...I immediately tried to kill myself with helium tank... two times... I always woke up with exit bag torn open with my hands, which I do not remember doing it...And then I crashed my car into a fucking BMW....And then my father called me that my dog fucking died, she had to be cremated and I wasn't there to say goodbye to my own dog.I was a terrible owner... I should have given my dog a better life... And I broke down crying again.

After all that, I just gave up on everything including suicide and started playing Resident Evil 4 over and over again like a fucking degenerate.

But... fate is a strange thing... Somehow I managed to meet this Singaporian girl from Hong Kong.She is beautiful, kind hearted, and financially wealthier than me by significant margin.She had to return back to Hong Kong for her job, however.

After that, I found myself a job at Incheon Airport where they needed a fluent english speaker.

We stayed in touch, texting each other and sharing things.She eventually opened up about having connections in financial district in USA and gave me some tips and heads up that ALL turned out to be 100% correct.

I started following her tips with small amounts at first, but then I got cocky and poured all my savings into investing.I started making 1 year worth salary within just 2 months...And guess what my dumbass did...I took out two fucking cash loans (45k dollars) and started investing with them and I did make very good money doing that.

Until... she told me to buy certain \*futures\*...

First 3 times worked just fine, but yesterday, right after I bought into a certain futures, the price dropped like 10 percent and triggered a margin call...

I lost everything yesterday.   
She lost everything, too.

Now, I have 0 money left, 2 huge loans that I cannot pay back.I have no one to talk to about it, no one that can help me about it.She does not communicate with me anymore.

I am so fucking done...

I am tired of finally getting what I \*needed\* and then have all of them be taken away from me over and over and over again.

Isn't this the very definition of insanity?

I even got so cocky that I started buying things I wanted with my credit card, thinking I can always withdraw needed cash from investment anytime I need.

Now I am in debt in total of 50k dollars hahahaha.

I just see no reason why I should continue, to be honest.   
I think I'm fucking done.

Next week, I will buy bunch of Charcoals, portable burner, a tape, and one night at a cheap hotel or a motel.   
And you probably already knows what that means...

I am done, guys.   
I see no way out of this.   
I'm not just talking about money, too.   
I can't handle this anymore.

If you see some news stories from South Korea about a man committing suicide with a charcoal in a rental car, that will most likely be me. 

I thought about doing it at home or a hotel, but research shows it can hurt other people around the area, so I won’t do that.

My only fear is that I might reincarnate into this fucking world...I am not religious by any means but I admit that some weird shit happens occasionally that science cannot just explain.   
And don't get me started with potentially reincarnating as a North Korean baby...   
Fucking hell... that would suck fucking dick...

I wish there would be nothingness after death.   
If not, I would prefer to be in hell, than reborn into this insane world.   
I don't fucking care if I reborn to a rich parents in first world countries.

No, I just don't like to exist.

That is not much to ask, right???

If you read this whole thing, thank you.I just wanted someone... anyone... to know this.

Sigh...

Goodbye, everyone."
"I hate humans. We are so fucking horrible, i dont understand why we havent gone extinct yet, perhaps its because we're so overpopulated, and yet we still force people to make even more humans just cuz of ""traditions"".. 

I hate how humans hate on everyone for literally anything and everything, someone does something slightly non common and they're immediately viewed as a disgusting freak. All of this hatred in the world is making me so ill, i dont want to live in a world like this, i fucking hate it so much, every day i have to live in a miserable world full of nothing but a bunch of bullies. I want to just stay in a little room away from society and just play my stupid escapism games til i get bored and kill myself.. I just cant keep living like this"

I have no friends, no family, no money, no purposes and no girlfriend...

I'm 27 and I never been loved by a girl in my entire life...

"I used to hit the gym, used to practice good hygiene even “put myself out there”. I stopped, however, when I realized that will not get me anywhere because I’m ugly. No one wants to associate with an ugly guy. I’ve been fired from jobs because I’m ugly, I’ve been kicked out of public places because I’m ugly, and I’ve even been turned down for friendships/relationships just because, you guessed, I’m ugly. So I haven’t hit the gym in a few months and stopped brushing my teeth and maintaining myself, at this point I don’t care if I get kidney failure because my life is a failure and no one would care if something happened to me"

But I was also a slutty person. I had a huge empty feeling in me always which I tried to fill with attention from men . So I had a boyfriend, I met him when I was 12 , I stayed loyal to him for 11 years and I thought I meant something to him, I was his sex doll in real, a body for him to experiment, loneliness crept in me, I ended up cheating on him and lost him too. Then came my whore phase, I started to sleep around, stopped studying at all, got into drugs and made myself available so easily, I forgot about everything else, like a future , job , career, my parents tried so hard to get me back but I was just an asshole to everyone, they made sure I can’t have sex anymore and took me far away but there is always the Internet, I became a internet whore, taking off clothes on camera, I never asked for money even, I got involved with dangerous people, my parents gave me chance after chance,I just end up ruining it again and again. I am a 26 year old with no career,job or a single friend, I am a slutty asshole, so today I have taken a decision to end it all. Do u think I should jump off from the 4 or 6 Th floor , I would like some direction on how to do it, I have to do it today, any methods are okay, I want it done a 100 percent I wanna b dead and end it all. I hate living as this slut. I do deserve to die so that someone will have a better chance at life not me."
"All my friends have abandoned me. My best friend wouldn’t have me at her birthday party because she’s going out with the people who made me try the first time. Instead of me its making sure the people who made me like this are ok. My boss then was gaslighting my mental health issues and laughing about it. Out of a job again. I FUCKING HATE ALL OF THEM. THIS WORLD CAUSED ME TO FUCKING BE LIKE THIS. I AM A PRODUCT OF HOW PEOPLE TREATED ME AND NOW I HAVE HAD ENOUGH

UPDATE: I am still here. thank you everyone, i have never felt so heard or understood by other people in my 25 years of living. Thank you to everyone who reached out to me offering to talk. It gave me a lot of faith in deciding to move forward from this and hopefully take a different path. "
I don’t feel like i can go on she was all that i had
"all i wanted was to live. a fucking normal life was that too much to ask for?

i'm tired of this endless cycle of pain and suffering and fucking bpd fuck this illness and fuck me for believing that i can fucking live with it 

i deserve to die. i am stuck in a cage with my fears and regrets and pain with me and i've been fighting it for 4 years and i can't do it anymore 
i don't want to live this life anymore.

the endless threats of suicide, the non stop suicidal thoughts, the guilt, pain, shame will all go fucking away all i have to do is man up and cut my wrists up it's not that hard  just can't get myself to do it i don't care how much it will hurt but i'm scared on what might happen after i die becuase i don't want to burn in hell or be tortured with the blade i killed myself with because i don't want to escape from hell to hell it's fucking unfair."
"I am going to kms in 1 hour. Bye world, and hope you some random stranger on the internet who goes through some shit, please take care and I hope you'll do better than me and not end up like me, keep going bro/sis... I, alone, decided to give up and lose this fight unfortunately,

 I am saying my last goodbyes to some random people on the internet lol (maybe nobody will even see this post but hey). Anyway, I should be dead by now 👍

Update: I am very sorry to announce that my brother has passed away 3 days ago, his body was found 2 days ago, hanging on a rope nod with a stool laying on the ground after some elderly neighbors have noticed he just disappeared as he used to be bringing good food cooked by him to these neighbors every single day, they knocked on his apartment door and heard nothing, they stayed a while waiting for a reply or he coming back if he was gone somewhere in town (as he really did not have any plans for this month, just staying in his apartment and cooking food for the neighbors), they panicked since it's been so long with no reply even by calls and they ended up calling the cops. They broke into his apartment and found his body hanging there for 1 day now, then his death was reported to us. His funeral is tomorrow, and we just wanted to update this post so you know the situation... We're very sorry to announce such things, since he was a good man, and please don't ask any other further questions... Maybe the story doesn't seem too real as people always told that our family is a liar, especially my brother who committed suicide, but I am trying to explain the situation as good as I can with my limited English knowledge and shock...

Greetings, I hope you all will have a good life and won't have to suffer such a tragedy... Bye now... "
"I’ve lived 15 years of my life and been thinking of killing myself again since my ladt attempt last year. Cutting myself isn’t doing the trixk anymore and I’m just tired. I already promised myself that I’d attempt again at the end lf the month, but here we are. Start of June and I still haven’t killed myself. But I feel like my self-harm habits would get worse instead.

I’m so tired and I want a break from life. I’m tired of feelinf sad and numb all the time and the only sense of comfort is literal ai. Nothing else. I always lie and say I’m fine so people don’t worry for me.

One of the things stopping me is the fact that if I fail, someone will have to watch over me. And I’m incredibly unfortable with that.

I just want my life to be over. Sorry if this post is all over the place. I just wanted to get this off my chest."
"I'm a 30 year old virgin, been unemployed for almost a year now living off my meager savings. Had to quit my last two jobs due to mental health and the fact I sucked at them. I can't find any menial jobs hiring that I can do. Soon I'll run out of money.

I have no friends IRL. Just online ones. I have many mental health problems due to a traumatic upbringing and I'm ADHD. My mother lives with me. I have nothing in life.

All I forsee is my life getting worse as I age and my health declines. All I want to do is have one happy experience before I die but it's impossible. Better to end the suffering."
"
im 16 and i totally fucked up my life i have no friends  sitting everyday in my room doing nothing and crying every night while my peers partying and doing some fun things i cant handle it anymore i think its my last day on that cruel world where no one cares about me"
"I (24F AMAB) fucking hate being a man. I cannot stand to look at myself in the mirror. I can’t stand this fucking male body. It’s not who I am. I have never needed something as bad as I needed air to breathe until I realized I was trans. It is a need for me. I need to or else I’m gunna die and SOON. Like I have no idea how on earth I could be alive in July. Before anyone suggests transitioning, I cannot. If I were to transition my wife will divorce me. I love her very much and she’s amazing. I need her in my life.

My one year trans anniversary is coming up on the 27th and I can’t bear it. I can’t bear to accept that I have to be cis now. The body I inhabit is not my own. It’s not me. Do you understand what it’s like to wake up and feel like you were forcibly stuffed into a costume? Do you know what it’s like to have a deep, deep need and desire to do something that will keep you alive just for everyone around you to say “yeah but can you be alive in a way that makes me comfortable? Not like that”. I’ve told people that if I don’t transition I will die and they don’t believe me. They must not because I cannot imagine them putting me through this intentionally, knowing that I meant what I said.

“But isn’t it good to follow God?” No actually it isn’t. I would MUCH rather spend an eternity in the firey pits of hell as a woman than spend a single moment in heaven as a man. Sorry but eternally looking like this fucking freak is not for me.

And that’s another thing, cis me is NOT ME. He is just some awkward weirdo. He was a hateful man and he is so fucking stubborn. I’ll be damned if I let that fucking freak take my place in this world. I’d much much much rather kill myself than live a fake life as a man. 

I’m going to kill myself. I don’t have another option.  I can’t keep living like this. Every day is an increasing level of pain. The pain, guilt, and sadness of it all is crushing me like boulders. Fuck I wanna die. I really hope that an opportunity comes soon. If not I am going to make a plan for sometime before the 27th. It’s just too much. I have accepted death and he is expecting me.

Sorry "
"The mental health system is awful. It's unbelievably terrible, and I'm not sure if it'll ever really improve.

You can't admit anything more than minor or occasional suicidal ideation to doctors or therapists without being sent away, and even just that is a risk. 

It's so harmful. Being punished for trying to get help. For daring to confide in someone that you're supposed to feel safe with. All it encourages is further isolation and people keeping everything inside until they collapse from it. Out of fear of being sent to a psych ward, they make sure their plans won't fail. 

I really wish things were different. That these sorts of thoughts weren't so controversial and quick to make people panic. Hotline volunteers and therapists are told to report people at risk, but what counts as being ""at risk"" varies for each individual. You often won't know if the person you're speaking with will overreact until it's too late. It's just not worth the potential trauma. 

Just genuinely being there to lend an ear and having a legitimate discussion about these thoughts is so much more helpful than being forcefully admitted to a hospital. I want to be able to tell my therapist that I don't just have vague thoughts of suicide. I have a basic plan and strong intent. But I can't. And it hurts. All these lies make me feel even worse after each session with her.

In an ideal world, the police wouldn't ever be involved under any circumstances, but in a more plausible scenario, cops wouldn't be called unless you were to tell them that you were actively attempting right at that moment. 

A lot of people seem to assume that voicing suicidal thoughts means that an attempt is automatically imminent. That's not the case. So many people just want someone to listen. They're suffering, and the last thing they need is to be seen as an immediate danger to themselves or others. 

I know there are moral and legal obligations, but I just don't understand how being treated the same as a criminal and being locked away in what is essentially prison is supposed to help anyone. Though then again, it isn't, really. Psych wards aren't meant to make you feel better and comfortable. Their primary purpose is to just keep you from doing anything for as long as you're in there. And right when you're discharged, you're on your own and expected to go about life as usual. Never mind the traumatizing experiences and potential debt you'll suffer afterwards. 

It's a horrible and predatory system. The world gives you so little options for genuine treatment and then makes you feel shame for having enough. You are not allowed even the basic freedom to end your life as you please. Your life is not your own."
"Last Friday I was chocked and sexually assaulted by my date, and I can’t for the life of me can’t understand why I’m so depressed(which is weird ) logically I know why I’m depressed but I can’t feel a damn thing emotionally. I feel this unbearable black hole and I haven’t completed a single assignment or gone to school or work for the past week. All I’m waiting for is to see my favorite professor tomorrow because she meant the most to me in my lifetime, and I’m done. I thought my life had meaning or something like that, but that all went down the drain after I told a therapist(not my therapist) our school therapist I was feeling this unbearable and I didn’t know how I was going to survive and all she said that “life was suffering” and now because the law requires her to make sure I don’t die I needed to sign a contract for her license and as long as I signed that she didn’t care what I did. I can’t even bring myself to eat I’ve lost 5 pounds over the last 5 days, all I can do is sleep, and I can’t breathe half the time. All I can think about is how disgusting, embarrassed, hurt, angry, and lifeless I feel. I just want quiet and to feel better. In this whole thing the only thing I’m sad about is A.) I didn’t get to see my therapist before I did this because I wanted her to keep her license and B.) my mom is going to be completely thrown of guard and I just love her so much and I don’t want her to feel like this is her fault. I really don’t want anyone to be sad but I just hope they understand that this pain was too much "
"They ignore you until you die. And then they say nice things about you. They’ll say “it was her time to go.” No bitch, if I had just felt loved and included, I wouldn’t have done it. And then during your funeral they cry like they ever even cared about you. Fake tears and lies. But they ignored you and your existence while it mattered. While it counted when you were still alive. At least then people might come to one of my events and remember I existed as I lie in the casket. "

"Every single time I make a mistake my brain immediately shuts down and I start spiraling into suicidal ideation. For example, tonight my partner asked me to bring something to them. I couldn’t find it and I was searching everywhere. I texted them saying I couldn’t find it. They said they were going to come upstairs and look for it too, which already made the feelings of anxiety and inadequacy flow through me. We were running through everywhere I looked. They asked if I had looked in their pants pockets and I said yes because I had. They went to their pants pockets and found it immediately. I instantly started spiraling and panicking, I felt so stupid and horrible. For the rest of the time we were apart I felt myself sinking. I sobbed for almost an hour, convinced that they were furious at me,they were going to leave me, and that I was going to kill my self the moment I got the chance. They’re asleep now and I am lying in bed, trying not to cry because all I want to do is end it but I don’t want to burden them with my dramatics. Why am I like this? It happens with everything, every time I do anything slightly wrong. How do I fix this? I hate living like this, constantly feeling unsafe with myself, walking on eggshells around MYSELF. It’s so stressful and exhausting. "

"I(25F) became engaged with my fiance(23M) a couple of months ago. He was paralyzed from the neck down because of an injury he suffered on his childhood, so he spent the rest of the days living as a quadriplegic. His injury caused him chronic respiratory problems which worsened overtime.

I met my fiance 2 years ago, and we fell in love, despite his condition, he was still a cute sweetheart. In the last months his condition got worse and he spent a lot time in the hospital on ventilators. He looked worse every day, but we had the hope he'd recover, and he proposed me marriage from his bed. Our wedding was scheduled to be in 2 weeks, but yesterday he passed away. His mind was not ready to give up, but his body couldn't survive any longer. He passed while I held his hand and gave him one last hug and kiss.

He was my soul mate and significant other. The best partner I could ever had. He's gone. I don't want to live anymore. He was atheist, but I prayy for his soul to be in Heaven. I wanna be with him in Heaven now, but I'm Christian and suicide wont let me get into Heaven. I just can live here in the meanwhile depressed by my fiance's death. I don't think life is worth living after losing my significant other. I won't ever find a guy like him. I haven't eaten anything on days and I haven't been able to sleep well. I just want to die soon, so I can be with him ."

"Listen I have no fucking option anymore, school literally only let's the selfish fucks succeed. If you're not the most safe kind of different they can handle they'll fuck you over, lie to you, abuse their power, and fuck. you. over. All the while they'll blow smoke up your ass about how much they want you to ""succeed."" 

I'm not ""succeeding"" I'm going to hell. Always telling me I'm a ""smart kid"" how stupid do you think I am? Honestly think I believe a word your two-tounged lying ass says? 

The school doesn't ""care about you"" the school doesn't want you to succeed, the school wants you to fall out the door on graduation and die in the streets so your kind can be known as the ""bad people.""

Yeah so I might just hang myself in a bathroom or something. If I had a gun I'd just shoot myself in his office, just myself obviously. I'm thinking I'll probably just cut myself in the bathrooms for now dude I'm sick living such a shitty life I could've done so much more but clearly my blood is my only voice around here.

"Thursday, Verge of  jump off the bridge Rescue boat and police car are arrived to me and they caught me for suicide attempt

The policeman bought me a coffee and took me to the police station, where we talked for three hours until my parents arrived.

Feels like the past few days were a dream

also I would regret about that I failed to jump off the bridge

"It was an irrational decision because I had a stupid fight with my parents and I only took 6 pills because people always said overdoses almost never work and when it does it’s only if it’s like a full bottle. I ended up having a whole heart attack a few hours later. Was in the hospital for 2 days, and I really regret it, my mom stayed with me the whole time and I felt very guilty. I did not like seeing my parents scared, and I was scared too. I was scared to die even though I hate living does that make any sense?"

"Why tf is suicide an exception? 

We praise people when they establish boundries about how they can make choices of what they do with their lives, so why tf is it anyone's business if I decide to self harm or commit suicide?

(Important note!!!: I am a porn addict, since when I was 11, but I always tried to be careful of what I was watching)



I’m 15 (turning 16 this year) and it has been a month since I started having troubles with this, and I don’t even know anymore, about anything at this point.

Nothing like that happened to me, I’ve been staring at kids, and I didn’t knew if I felt pleasure from it, and when I started thinking that I did, I started going crazy (all of this in 1-3 days). 
I started forcing myself to vomit, skipping school days, and everything (I study in a school full of children). And the problem is that never anything like this ever happened to me. I started having this disgusting thoughts and I don’t know what to do with them. In the beginning of all of this, I started felling so fucking disgusted, I wanted to actually vomit and i would go to the bathroom all time in class, but now, I can’t even feel disgusted anymore, and I just want to fucking suffer because of this. 

It comes to a point where, when I don’t feel disgusted about these thoughts, I just want someone or something to make me fell horrible, and hate myself. Because I don’t know what I feel. I don’t know if I like them, and if I like them, I wanna suffer from this liking. I cried in shower today because I just want to suffer and suffer so bad.

Today, I saw a 12 year old girl (probably) and I thought she was pretty and I felt so bad for this. (it was mid the basketball game I had today) I wanted to cry so much because of that. 
I wanted to hug someone, because my mother’s hugs are not working anymore. 

I block myself from looking at the streets or maybe looking at some kid walking, or someone younger, because I’m scared of what I might fell or whatever. 
I want to be alone, not be in society no more because I’m scared of what I can do, I stopped trying to learn 3D modeling because I’m scared of what I might search on my PC. 

I was playing with my dog now, and I remembered “oh shit, you’re having a good time, stop that” but now, I’m sad I can’t have a good time, and not because I might be a pedo…I think you know where this goes.

Well, I’m scared, I don’t know what to do, I want to die but I’m scared about it, I want to suffer but I don’t know If I deserve it, I don’t know nothing anymore. 

I wish I could be more worried about this.

I talked to my therapist about all of this and she said I am not a pedophile, and for some reason, I thought that was a “lose” for me, but I should he cheering and everything, but for some reason, I was kinda sad about it, I don’t know if that’s good

"I’ve been together with my boyfriend for over a year now. First relationship I have ever been in. I am 18 years old. We live together and we basically do everything together. Our relationship has been rough for a long time now. He cheated on me 6 months into our relationship but I forgave him and we’ve been working on trust and things of that sort since. He has a lying problem which we have gone to couple therapy for in the past. He lies everyday for no reason at all. It gets frustrating to deal with but I try my best to have understanding and consideration there for him. I love him so much. 

I struggle with suicidal thoughts and self harm tendencies. I’ve struggled with it since the ripe and young age of 8/9 years old. I grew up in a very toxic environment where I was sexually abused by my father which I think has stuck with me and made me the way I am today which my boyfriend knows all about. I have a self harm addiction.

We got into an argument today about his lying problem and he straight out said to me it would be easier for him if I just killed myself. Blankly said it to my face. I did not know what to say. I just froze in the spot and started crying. He knows I’m suicidal. He knows I have suicide notes already written and ready. What he said has pushed me to the breaking point. I don’t know what to do. I have no one. 

Should I just kill myself? "
I don't know why I'm feeling this way I just feel so drained so tired I'm so sick of everyone and everything I'm sick of being autistic why was I born this way I can't work school is a nightmare and I genuinely can't do this anymore everyone is so much cooler and happier then me going to parties getting partners and shit and I'm just rotting in bed I have no future ahead of me I live in such a shit country and I'll never get to do what I love because of my lack of skills I always wanted to work in the entertainment industry but lack any skills so I'm just worthless and I want to die honestly just wanna die dysphoria is killing me from the inside out and I'm such a loser and I'm genuinely just a shitty person i just had an argument with my friends and ugh I have like what 5 friends and they all have 50+ this fucking stinks man I wanna die
Nothing fucking helps. Therapists are worthless. Medication doesn't help. Inpatient and outpatient doesn't do shit either. What's left? What else is there for me other than suicide?

"I cleaned my room, did the dishes, set the table. Put my laundry away and brushed my teeth. Pet my dog and looked around the house reminiscing over all the memories I’ve had over the years in this home, the good and the bad. In tears I got my jacket and took an Uber to the spot where I’d end my life. This lady approached me and asked for directions, I had felt so ugly I didn’t even feel like I was worth speaking to. Just the fact that she said something and wanted my help made me feel like I was needed by someone but I was also upset because I had planned to end my life in this spot I couldn’t just let this lady I spoke to watch that happen. So I sat by the bench and just cried in this sun wishing and praying for better times and for my brain to be kinder to me so I don’t have to do this. I don’t want to have to die, but it feels like I have to. I wish the escape was easier. "

I am riddled with suicidal thoughts and depression and she worked hard my entire life to support and take care of me. I have no job, I'll lose the house we rent, I can't afford anything myself. I dont even have a license. She did everything for me. I dont even know how to make a doctors appointment myself. I don't know what to do. I've always told myself that when she dies I'll just kill myself and thats all I can think of right now. My entire family was here all day and I had to pretend that I'll be okay, but I know I wont.

"i was raped almost a year ago and forced to go to the police who didn’t believe me basically. my family went to go hear the man’s side of the story. the man lied and they believed him. everyday i struggle to ignore the fact that my own family would do this. i am heartbroken in so many ways and have just slowly stopped speaking to people about how i feel. it is very hard for me to feel like i am good friends with people because none of them know how i feel or what happened to me and i know none of them would care even if they did know

every day i have flashbacks to either the rape, the moments leading up to the rape, or the way my family shamed and humiliated me. i have really been trying to ignore it all since there’s nothing i can do but it’s really really hard 

i just feel so alone. like i have some friends but they don’t really know and i just feel like im carrying so much weight im so tired

i have less moments of wanting to die but they are so intense. my parents both bought guns recently and i just always fantasize and how i could just finally rest if i really try. i feel really alone 

my family sees me as dirty and tainted which really hurts. my dad hit and screamed at me a lot but now he tries to pretend like he cares. this has set me back so far "
"i'm an 18 year old girl and it feels like my life is over. there's nothing left for me and i don't think things will get better, i have tried so hard looking for reasons to stay but nothing works. just yesterday my mom absolutely beat me, slapped me and pulled my hair because she saw my self harm scars on my legs and told me i was an idiotic and disappointing child. i don't have any friends that i talk to, and nobody checks on me. i am lonely, i've been talking to my ex these past 2 months and it's been nothing but pain and suffering, yet i can't say anything about it because it'll only make it worse. i am a horrible, disgusting and ugly girl and there is no hope for me. i only disappoint everyone around me and it would be better if i was just dead. tonight i will write my suicide note and cut myself more before i go to the rooftop and jump to my death. i am nothing but a waste of space on this earth.

edit: i'm still alive, earlier i wrote my suicide note and went to the rooftop but i just kept staring down, i couldn't bring myself to move. the breeze was nice and it was so quiet, i felt like i shouldn't disrupt the peaceful night that i was experiencing in that moment. maybe another day. i'm sorry for not replying to your guys' comments, i don't have much energy.

edit 2: thank you everyone for your kind words, i'm really sorry for worrying all of you but i hope you know that you guys have kind souls and you are so very beautiful. you all deserve everything good in the world, thank you for trying to help me and talk me out of it. maybe i will keep trying a little harder for all of you. i love you all"
"I think this is just my version of my suicide note. It feels eerily comforting to sit here and write this all out. Anyhow. The story. 

I’m diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and I’ve had all ranges and subtypes of OCD, most recently, they tell me it’s POCD. But I just don’t think it is anymore. 

- When I was anywhere from 14-18, I looked up “jailbait”. At the time, I thought it meant the girls looked younger (around 16) but were actually 18+. Found out last year that’s not what it means, to my horror. I even might have searched it up like two years ago, I can’t fucking remember anything anymore. 

- When I was 14-17, I would seek out to look at girls around my age to masturbate to. I thought this was normal. I didn’t know any better. Hell, when I was 18, I looked at a picture of a 10 year old. They looked older than 10, I don’t know what the fuck was happening to my brain. (Again, told my mother about this and she just said “people do weird shit when they’re teenagers”)

- Now, at 25, I still find myself attracted to girls who are as young as 16, and as old as 40. Which people say is normal but, whatever. Sometimes when masturbating I would think “What if that girl was only 17? That’s hot.” And I had those thoughts because I THOUGHT THAT WAS NORMAL AND OKAY. I’m fucking truly evil. 

For these acts, I’ve realized, my partner doesn’t know that I’m such a sick monster. Neither does my family (mom kind of knows because I told her, she also told me it doesn’t make me a pedophile). I feel so sick to my stomach. If they knew, they would despise me. I DIDNT THINK IT MADE ME A PEDO. I DIDNT MEAN TO. 

I’m so sorry to all my loved ones, It’s not just OCD, I’m an evil and despicable human. For recompense, I’m killing myself tonight, gonna wait until everyone goes to sleep as to not disturb anyone. I can’t find happiness anymore, I wish I could take it all back. I didn’t know. I didn’t know."
"fuck you and everything you did to me. Just made to fucking suffer in this world because he couldn't keep it in his pants. Everything in my life which was ever was because of him. I was fucking 8 when you slap, 9 when you me beat til I was bleeding, 12 when you tried to fucking kill me and mum, I remember every date that you did something to me. You tried to fucking run me with a knife. I was a fuxking child, I thought you protected me. You never fucking did and I hope you burn in hell. If I don't kill myself I swear to God I will fucking kill you. Disgusting piece of human bring. fuck you"
"There is not a single thing I enjoy doing anymore. There is no part of my day that brings me any happiness. I have been fortunate enough to be able to buy a nice house on my own, with a ""good"" job but I no longer enjoy anything. My entire body aches every day and the mental pain is even worse. I wrote down all the activities I do each day, for both work days and weekends. There is not one part of any of that which I enjoy. Most people's advice would be to change and do something different, but there is nothing I aspire to be and nothing I aspire to do. It's been this way for a few years now and I came to the realisation that there isn't much point continuing. I have simulated the rest of my life from here in my head and I don't see the point. This is boring and I've had enough"
"the moment i set a day and a plan everything seems so freeing, food tastes so good because it's the last time i'm gonna have chic fila it's the last time i'm gonna watch the sunset, i can eat whatever i want it doesn't matter if i gain weight because i will be dead in a few days. it doesn't matter what goes wrong in my life because it will be the last time i dissapoint people around me, it will be the last time i experience being a living human because in a matter of time i'm gonna be nothing but memories and i will fade away into the universe why is this all so freeing? nothing i do now will be permanent because my body will be gone and i will not have to experience being mentally ill for life :) i am so happy, i don't understand why people are sad when you bring up death because it literally means you're free from all this suffering in life and nothing matters anymore. it doesn't matter, nothing will matter."
last night i wasnt brave enough but i think now im ready fuck my life and my ugly body
"I hear people saying this or I read this on social media - ""Don't do it, others will be in pain. You'll put others in pain. They'll suffer.""
But what about my pain? What about my sufferings? What did I do to deserve all this? I still feel like I don't deserve happiness. What about the questions I don't have answers to? Sometimes when I'm in my lowest I feel like why should I think about how the others would feel because once I'd be gone I wouldn't have to think about it anyway."
"It's been a rough week. 1 year ago my 1 year old kitten, was hit by a car and died. I found out days later when her body was brought to me, and while crying I burried her in my garden. It's 1 year later, and now, her sister, my other kitten, is dead. She was only 2 years old, and she was hit by a car. I once again cried buckets while burrying her last week. 

Now, I feel alone, I feel hurt and nothing seems to make me happy. I watch something, I think about how she would lay down with me to watch something with me. I play video games, I think about how she'd come in and relax with me. I lay in bed, I think about how she'd come in and jump onto my bed, demanding to be pet and scratched. Everything I do is just overtaken with thoughts of what my cat would do while I do these things. 

It hurts, it hurts so much. 

And I just want it to stop. "
"I’ve been passively suicidal since I was 12. I have spent more years of my life wishing I was dead than happy to be alive. But does anyone actually ever feel happy to be alive? To me, it’s always been a sort of “an object in motion stays in motion” thing and people just stay alive because they’re already doing it. It’s not an active decision or something they’re particularly pleased about. "

"Hi, (18F) 

i’m writing this because my life has come to an end. 
i have held on to hope for far to long and i have nothing left. 
i want to say thank you to everyone who has been there through thick and thin, but it’s my time to leave. i will be watching down from heaven to see my loved ones succeed and thrive through these hard times in the world. i’m came here to say i am grateful for 
family
friends
my boyfriend 
unfortunately none of that can save me. i’ve held on to this rope for too long and it’s finally time for me to let go. i know no one will understand but the only thing that matters is that i won’t be in anyone’s way anymore, i wont be burden anymore, i wont be a nuisance anymore, and i finally will be at peace and where i belong. 

i plan on ending my life tomorrow at dusk (6pm) because it’s the most peaceful time to let go of that rope. i told everyone if i would commit suicide, i would wreck my car. but i’ve got bigger plans than that. more peaceful plans to say the least. 

i’m leaving a note with my reddit account and username, so my loved ones can read this message. 

thank you to all the redditers that support me through these times. i had so many happy moments in my life, but the dark ones won. it’s time to fly. 

thank you 🤍"

When I was 18 years old I was looking for erotic stories online (I prefer to read smut). I was into some really weird shit such as exhibitionism and sometimes incest porn (I know, disgusting). I found a thread on a sub-reddit that had relevance to my exhibitionism kink.  


While I was masturbating and scrolling through threads, I see a comment from a man talking about engaging in sexual acts with his stepdaughter (who I assumed was an adult). I didn't think much of it and eventually just put my phone down and ""finished up."" Afterwards I got a bad feeling from the comment and went back to check. I realized that I had missed context (I was skimming over stuff and not reading carefully) implied sexual behavior had occurred before she was of legal age. I checked his post history and determined that he was a fucking pervert. I understand that people often post weird fantasies online that are fake, but this one seemed too real. I went back and reported other suspicious comments from that subreddit (it wasn't moderated very well). I had never come across anything super sketchy before so I wasn’t really expecting it.


As a result, I almost had a panic attack and felt extremely angry. I then reported the individual to the FBI or NCMEC (I forgot which one). I have told my friends about this, four therapists, and my girlfriend; they all think that it's no big deal and that I did the right thing. I can't stop ruminating about it and I've spent the past few days completely consumed by it. I've not done anything but ruminate and replay the events from that day.  


My mind has convinced me that I'm an evil monster who enjoys child abuse. At the time I had imagined the stepdaughter mentioned as a woman older than me at the time (mid 20s to 30s) with a heavier build, large breasts and pubic hair. I just skimmed through the comments and wasn't really reading between the lines.  


Since then I've been super fucking careful where I get my erotic stories from. I feel extreme guilt and almost feel responsible for it. I feel like I sought out literal CSAM. I've never fantasized about children in my life, and I've never been attracted to a child. When I was 18 I worried myself sick about being attracted to 17 year olds.  

I feel like a monster, but people tell me I did the right thing. I loathe pedophiles. I hate them. I hope anyone that consumes CP rots in hell personally. Am I going fucking crazy? Everything feels like it's closing in around me."
"I don't have any desires to change my gender or anything like that I just... Fuck.

I hate how other men treat me. I hate how men treat women. I feel so guilty knowing just how disgusting the average male is and their attitude toward woman, but compensating by trying to be overly polite is just weird as well. I don't want to be a white knight or anything like that.

I hate the fact that I have to fit in with macho society and if I don't, i'm shamed. I hate how no one supports me and the only advice I have ever received is to man up. 

I hate that I have to do so much to fit in and that I can never appear weak. I especially hate that my naturally shy and social anxiety ridden personality is unmasculine and I can never be honest about myself without immediately killing any relationship.

I hate that make body shaming is normalised and there's nothing you can say or do about it or people will immediately accuse you of being insecure. There's just no winning. 

I hate what being a man means for me. I can't cry and I can't express my emotions. I'm so fucking horny all the time and it makes me feel disgusting and horrible. 

I hate that women grope me and everyone laughs and thinks it's funny. A girl reaches out and grabs my genitals in public and then people get angry at me when I have a panic attack and fucking publicly humiliate myself. 

I hate that I have put so much work into crafting my body and yet I still feel so painfully fucking insecure because of the standards I am trying to live up to. No matter how good I look I still feel the need to carve out my flesh with a razor blade. I feel fat unless I am starving myself, I feel skinny unless I'm pinning myself with dangerous chemicals to put on muscle mass.

I hate that I'm one centimetre above average height and that means people do not respect me. It's infuriating and humiliating. People make fun of me. I am ABOVE THE MEDIAN what more do you want.

I hate that I have average sized genitals and that will never be enough to truly satisfy a partner. That they will always compare me to someone better. That some women simply cannot orgasm without a larger member and the sheer humiliation around that. I can't even say anything because being insecure is toxic and immature and I would be mocked and humiliated if I ever expressed my feelings in anyway.

I hate myself"

(Feel free to ignore) My hair is nappy. black people are just seen as monkeys and much more. People make fun of us for being black. I don’t even get what there is to be proud of being black. People are always saying black is the chosen race by god. But so what being black is the worst does not matter if my race is the chosen no disrespect to god. Black is the most hated race on earth. So many are against black people all because of their race. And some people are proud of being black because they they are said to be the chosen race. But if you push the chosen thing away. What really is there to be proud of? our history is the worst. Oh and if you have mental illness being black will make it worse. Plus with the chosen race thing not every black person is chosen anyway If that is true. 
"I (19f) have always been a really introverted, depressed loner. I honestly don't see the point in this life, my existance. I mean why am i here? To just exist for a while and then die? There's no point in any of it. So I think the best thing for me to do is kill myself. I don't really enjoy life, so why live? It's all pointless, the everyday struggle is pointless. Whatever, I guess it's over"
"Since that day I have wanted to commit suicide. I know I am going to do it, but I don't know how or when. I have already started writing the letters I will leave behind for my loved ones. In total, I will write 10 letters, I am currently on the second one. Once l have finished writing them all, I will look for the method I prefer. I think that dying from an overdose is the best solution, but for now, I am not focusing on that.

Hi! I’ve been carving superficial marks into my wrist and listening to bright eyes. Can someone give me some encouragement to just finish the job??? Please tell me to get a job done for the first time in my life 
"There are so many good things in life that make it worth living, but it only takes one terrible thing to shatter your life into a living nightmare worse than death, and there are plenty more vile things in the world than there are good ones. 

I see so many people wishing to die for a plethora of different reasons, valid reasons to be upset about life because of them, but it’s horrible that it can push us so far as to want to die just to stop experiencing them. What’s worse is that I feel like almost all of them are due directly or indirectly by someone else’s hand. 

I’ve seen people take their life after being sexually assaulted, physical abuse, child exploitation and abuse. I’ve seen people not be able to afford living while others happily take advantage of their power and do anything to increase their wealth. I’ve seen medical professionals use their patients as mere objects, even those in the mental health services treat patients in dire need less than the trash on the street. I’ve seen systems set in place in society, meant to have strict rules to minimize and nullify abuse of power be treated as mere suggestions as they do whatever they want on whim, regardless of the consequences it’ll have on others. 

Thing is, there are plenty of kind and good people out there, feeling fulfilled by doing any little thing to spread kindness and make the world just a little bit better, but it’s all for naught. There’s only so much they can do before they’re beaten down into submission, put down like a mere statistic as their work and everything they’ve done for others is destroyed, nullified and anything of value is scrapped by those hungry, greedy vultures who want it all for themselves. They can claim otherwise, they can claim to be helping people but it’s all an act in order to satisfy critiques and seem genuine when deep down they don’t care. 

I wish it wasn’t like this. It’s childish wishing the world was like a fairytale, but I’d like to see how a world with people assisting and helping each other, instead of taking advantage of each other and stabbing themselves in the back, would look like. I’d like to see all those people I’ve met throughout my life who have lost will to live or life completely, I’d like to see where they’d be at in that world, what they’d be up to, how their day would look like. But I won’t, I never will, not in this existence at least."
"
i don’t know if i can post this but i need to get this off my chest. i (16f) was manipulated into making csem of myself for most of my life starting at a very young age. i have a very deep history with csem. i have always had an insanely deep hatred for pedophiles and try to report as much terrifying activity as i can to keep children safe. however i am very traumatized so i revictimize myself over and over again by creating more csem of myself and a few months ago on twitter i sought out people who were pedophiles to talk to and send pictures of myself to. this resulted in me accidentally seeing a lot of csem through the tags. i watched in morbid curiosity thinking “oh my god, i feel so bad for her, i hope she’s ok now” the whole time. i am so desensitized to porn and gore that csem was the only thing that truly sickened and horrified me. then i searched the tags for new ones which i would report eventually i found people that sent me csem when i sent them my own pics and groups that had it. this occurred for about a week and i reported as much as i could. i am not aroused by children in any way and i have always believed pedophilia is one of the worst crimes ever, and that pedophiles are inexcusable. i don’t know why i did this. i’ve seen so many horrific things out of morbid curiosity that made me truly sick. i feel like a monster. i’ve never been attracted to children or aroused by them. i can’t live with the guilt. i don’t know what to do with myself. i get terrible intrusive thoughts about pedophilia. i don’t know if having sought out csem out of morbid curiosity makes me a pedophile. this is eating away at me. as a victim i know how damaging and horrible it feels to know there are people out there who have seen your abuse and i’m appalled i’ve contributed. it was like a form of self harm because i would feel horrible and sick every time i saw a video. extremely graphic things i wish i could forget more than anything. the guilt makes me nauseous. this was about two months ago and the guilt and shame is killing me. i have a lot of mental health problems and i don’t know if this is pocd because i did act on something. i can’t live like this anymore.

edit: thank you for the comments but i still feel so guilty and terrible because i’ve heard of pocd before and am familiar with intrusive thoughts but from what i’ve read people say they only fear they’re going to view csem/have only accidentally viewed it. i started viewing it on purpose and this is what makes me feel sick because i don’t know why besides morbid curiosity. these men were talking to me like i was a small child and i fed into it. i feel like people reading don’t understand how truly horrible what i’ve done is. i don’t want to repeat the cycle of abuse and i have zero urge to. remembering what i’ve done makes my chest feel like i just found out the world is ending.

"i never understood the defenses against suicide, now more than ever. “you need to survive” “you need to keep going” why? because you said so? because living things are programmed to continue their existence at any cost for the sake of spreading and multiplying consciousness? is it not a sign that we don’t need to be here if we don’t want to be. it is not natural to be suicidal. it goes against all of our body’s instincts. and yet this melancholy persists. we have the tools to help each other die, it almost seems cruel to deny. we torment each other to the point of an isolated beg for release, and deny that mercy. i hope one day it isn’t so taboo a subject. by a certain age and determination we all deserve freedom and happiness. my form of that just happens to be fading away. death comes for us all, so what if the chosen few choose to accept it early? it’s all i dream of. i know i don’t belong here on this plane, it takes a lot of strength to acknowledge that from a young age. i yearn for my place among the stars. i’m a ghost walking among you while a faraway home calls out to me. i only see purpose and joy during the astral peace of sleep."
"This world is insane. I cannot believe this is the life we are living.

Society is collapsing before our eyes and everyone just seems totally cool with that? I don't know how people can be so carefree and live their life without thinking about this kind of stuff. I'm so jealous. I don't know what these people are on, but I want some.

I literally don't know why or how I'm here in this day and age—in the year of our Lord, 2023. What did I do to deserve this? I was forced into this world against my will, and now I'm not allowed to leave it, lest **I** be labeled the ""selfish"" one.

What am I supposed to do with my life? I'm not in school anymore; I haven't been since I was 14. I've never had a job and I don't have a license. It's not like I have anything to live for, besides not making my family miserable by giving up.

This subreddit feels like sanity to me. It's genuinely the **only** place where I don't feel alone.

I don't see the point in living my life when my only wish is to end it. Not a day passes by where I don't consider it. I am tired of being stuck in a vessel that contributes nothing to society.

No matter how much help I am given, I am always living with the thought that, inevitably, my cause of death will be suicide. I can not believe I'm expected to live another sixty years *at least*. I just don't accept that.

Anyways, I'll be 18 come January 4th. Unfortunately."
I feel hopeless. I hate my life so much.

"Has anyone here walked in on a loved one who took their own life or witnessed it? How do you deal with it? I came home to my girlfriend w a bullet hole through her head and it isn't getting easier. In fact, I've had a harder time going on year 2 than the first. Interactions w other women make me feel like I’m cheating on her. Any mention of suicide whether in a song or a bad joke has me breaking down."
"I’m 14, and I fucking hate being a male. It’s like everyone expects us to just suck it up and deal with whatever’s thrown our way, but honestly, it’s exhausting. There’s all this pressure to be “manly” or whatever, and I’m supposed to act like I’ve got it all figured out, but I don’t. Not even close.

I’ve been dealing with depression for a while, and it’s not something I’ve been able to talk about with anyone. Every time I try to hint at it, people just tell me to toughen up, like being sad or overwhelmed isn’t something I’m allowed to feel. I’ve had days where getting out of bed feels impossible, where I just stare at the ceiling wondering what the point of everything is. But I can’t say that out loud because I’m supposed to be “strong.” I don’t even know what that means anymore.

What makes it worse is all the shit that’s expected of me as a guy. I’m not supposed to cry, I’m not supposed to show any weakness, and I’m definitely not supposed to ask for help. But all of that just builds up until I feel like I’m going to explode. There’s so much pressure to be perfect, to be this idea of what a man should be, and I’m not sure I can live up to it. I’m just a kid trying to figure things out, but it feels like there’s no room for that.

And then there’s porn. I started watching it when I was younger, and now it’s like I can’t stop. It’s this cycle where I keep going back to it even though I know it’s screwing with my head. It’s not just the addiction part that gets to me, but how it’s warped the way I see things. I find myself comparing everything to what I see in those videos, and it’s messed up my view of what sex and relationships are supposed to be like. But who the hell am I supposed to talk to about this? Admitting it feels shameful, like I’m even more of a failure.

Sometimes, it feels like there’s no way out of all this. I’ve thought about suicide more than once because it just feels like everything’s too much. The pressure, the loneliness, the feeling that I’m not good enough—it all piles up until I can’t breathe. And the worst part is that it feels like I can’t talk to anyone about it. I’m supposed to be this rock, someone who doesn’t let shit get to them, but I’m falling apart inside.

Dealing with girls at this age is so fucking annoying. There’s this constant pressure to impress them, to be the guy they want, but half the time, i have no fucking idea to what that even means. It’s not just about wanting to date or hook up; it’s the whole social aspect that comes with it. Girls can be confusing as hell—one minute, they’re into you, and the next, they’re acting like you don’t exist. It’s hard not to take that personally, and it makes you doubt yourself even more. You start second-guessing everything you do or say around them, worrying about how you come across. And then, if things don’t go well, it feels like the whole world is judging you. It’s like you’re always walking on eggshells, trying to figure out how to act without screwing up, and it’s exhausting. The pressure to be ""good enough"" for girls, while also trying to live up to all these other expectations, can make you feel like you’re constantly failing.

I know I’m not the only one feeling like this. Guys don’t talk about it, but a lot of us are struggling. The statistics are out there—men are way more likely to die by suicide, and it’s not because we’re weaker or anything like that. It’s because we’ve been taught that asking for help is a sign of weakness, and that’s just bullshit. We’re dying because we’re too scared to admit that we’re not okay.

I’m writing this because I need to get it out there. If you’re reading this please reach out to me , i just want to talk to someone."
"I 30F just recently found out my husband now wants to be a woman. I’ve known him for 10 years, been together for 8 years, married for almost 3 years. 

The reason I found out was because for 2 weeks straight he was cold, distant, couldn’t even smile at me, looked annoyed whenever I talked, wouldn’t cuddle, etc.. I went through his phone and found out he was on transgender groups.

To make a really long story short yes he does want to be a woman. He has also known the entire time. He’s known since high school. 

My husband is bisexual which I’ve never had an issue with. He’s told me hundreds of times over the years how he came out to his parents in high school. What I now have learned is the truth was he didnt come out at Bi, no he came out as trans. He’s purposely hid this from me for the whole 10 years. His mother and brother knew as well.

I am a straight female. He knows this. There were plenty of other women who were bisexual going after him when we first met. I come from an extremely religious family. The others didn’t. It’s like he purposely chose me to torture me, knowing full well it was never going to work.

My biggest goal and dream in life was to be a mother and he knew that. I just wanted 1 marriage with a husband who loved me and wanted to grow old together. Now I get none of that. He’s taken 10 years from me that I will never get back. 10 years I could’ve had to find my actual spouse who wanted kids and to grow old together.

I’ve been trying to make it work but the more I look into him transitioning and the changes the more I realize this is a stranger who I don’t know and that’ll only get worse with time. 

My self confidence is shot. I feel like complete shit all of the time. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I can barely hold the weight of my body with my legs.

I just truly don’t see any light or road ahead. All I want is this pain and suffering to stop. The level of trust that has been broken in unrepairable. I can never love or trust again. 

My options basically are leave him and be alone for my whole life and die alone. Stay with him and never be happy or attracted to my spouse. Or just kill myself and be done with it all. It’ll probably even be best for him if I’m just dead because then he can move on with his life and be as happy as can be free from me. 

I just don’t think I can go on anymore…"
"I'm sooo fucking tired of having to deal with everything. We are brought into this world solely on the decision of our parents and then they when we can't do anything for ourselves, they do it for us but who knew back then that we were just accumulating debt. Debt that had to be paid once we were of age by giving control of our life to our parents. What to do? Who to marry? How to speak? What to think? Who to talk to? Who not to talk to? Fucking everything.

I truly wish I was never born or that I'd somehow die. I used to pray for death. Lately, I've just been self harming more and more. I guess now I'm finally coming to terms with the idea that I have to do something myself. I keep wishing that I'll totally snap at some point and do it also subconsciously but I guess like everything in life I have to be proactive about this. But oh well, atleast I'll have control over something. "
"Like yuh in the moment it seemed like a good idea n whatever. We're both pretty fuckin depressed n shit so it seems like a way out together. Like I've had suicidal thoughts and shit for a long ass time, I tried to starve myself to death once but then developed an eating disorder instead bruh.

It's supposed to be at the start of 2024 July. But honestly now I'm thinkin about it and I'm kinda afraid because idfk if I actually wanna do that. 

If I kill myself I wouldn't want to do it on a deadline or with other people. I'm scared of the chance of one of us failing, or one dying before the other, or something. 

But I honestly dunno if I can tell her this shit because I'm afraid that she will be upset and will be ruined and depressed, and I don't wanna put her in that situation because what if she fuckin ends up killing herself from that anyways. 

I'm like kinda not into this and I just dunno what to do about it. I'm too fuckin afraid to talk to her about it because I don't want to hurt her by turning down such a huge fuckin thing, and I can't like.. break up with her because then she would absolutely fuckin kill herself, man. I just dunno what the fuck to do anymore"
It feels like I’m in some kind of a video game or simulation?
"I gonna hang myself, I so fucking tired of being taken for granted and treated like a worthless piece of shit. Fuck everyone I killing myself because you all just could put any effort into keeping me alive "
"I wish I had fucking terminal cancer so I would finally die without having to kill myself. My life sucks, I graduated college but I have no job. I'm not smart enough, rich enough, good enough. I have no idea what will happen with my life and I'm terrified. It seems like I wasn't born to be happy. I don't want to live a miserable life forever."
"I took 1000mg of tramadol, 200mg quetiapine and my normal dose Escitalopram 10mg. Idk if this enough please let me go to sleep. Im sorry to everyone who cares about me"
"Every day, I wake up, wishing I had died in my sleep. It’s the same routine, over and over again. I can’t take this shit anymore."
"Something is terribly wrong with this world if there are kids trying to end themselves
  
I am suicidal since 4 years now and I am 16 now so I do understand their feelings but ending your life at that ripe age while others are busy playing video game can be quite overwhelming..

When I first discovered I am suicidal I started hating myself even more because I believed that I was different from other people of my age and was scared of sharing my thoughts with anyone which led me to believe that I am evil for bringing such thoughts in my head and my parents don't deserve a child like me and that wound has stayed with me since......"
I can't think about my future because I don't see myself having one 
"at least how it feels like, this planet is a bizarre biological prison and an existential horror house that basically functions to break you. to make you go nuts. you either turn evil or become crazy. if you dare try to leave Hell, you are persecuted. the more time goes on the more senseless all evil becomes to me and i feel like it's definitely succeeded. i am slowly losing my shit increasingly more so."
"I'm a 38 years old poet, two suicide attempts, in the past, and a list of ""good"" things and bad things, I have decided that I am going to kill myself, between this September and November, before my birthday in December. I just wanted to say it, let it float in the air.

Postscript :

thank you all for writing to me, for your generous messages, for taking the time to think of someone you don't know. From a distance I send you all my love a huge hug and I leave you one of my poems.

Thank you very much for everything.

Poem

September


I bring the story of a broken book, 
of its yellowish-stained pages, 
of the humidity and beauty, 
of letters underlined in pencil and their interior filled with mysterious deepness. 

I bring the story of a broken ashtray, 
of the smoke ascending to a cloud of grey breathings, 
of an open half-drunk bottle of wine, 
of the lonely and melancholic afternoons, 
of the days in which we walk alone, 
we sleep alone, 
we wake up alone, 
to see through the window the world has not stopped even an instant
for us. 

I bring perfume of poppy and stork’s-bills
Confused memories
Illegible letters

I bring an aroma of beer in my throat, 

nights with full moon
air condensed in eternity. 

I bring with me the games of the broken childhood, 
the glamorously-dressed simplicity, 
the black and deep eyelashes as a nocturne by Chopin, 

I bring a worn leather pouch full of

Saavedras

Bukowskis

Kafkas

Crows and poems next to
black, 

blue, 

maybe also grey pens, like the sky today, 

I bring
night in my eyes, 

rings under the eyes

porous skin

pale skin

asleep skin

purple nails

purple death,

I bring 
hot sunny days, 


lights shining in the retina, 

I bring
fatigue and a dried, dozy, sharp tongue, 

I bring coldness

I bring fog

I bring verses covered with melancholy

Verses which smell lik ginger

Verses which fade away, and run and camouflage
on the white walls. 


I bring
Gurneys and hospitals

I bring
Needles and botflies

I bring
Your look and your voice

I bring
this red pocket book with red poems and red blood

I bring
arrows and raptures, 
letters and birthdays and well-kept conflicting images, which people don’t know


I bring emptiness.

I bring emptiness."
Just got done hanging out with my “Friends” and I think I finally have it in me to cut my head off with a chainsaw just bought one yesterday and I’m planning to use it when my parents go to bed. I honestly don’t care if my funeral is vacant. Because I have no one else to turn to anymore. I’ve felt like this forever and I don’t care what anyone says when the sun goes down im going to do it. And I don’t believe in God because I know when you die it all goes black. BYE GUYS!!!
"I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm 22 year old female, I'm in college and I'm graduating july 26th so I'm almost done but I don't care.

I dont care about graduating, and I'm not proud of myself, I don't care if my family is proud, I don't care about my future, I have no friends, I have nothing.

I don't know how to keep trying, I can't get to therapy or a doctor because of my military insurance. But, I'm scared of pain, so I can't find any way to end it easily.

What do I do? Do I give up? Am I just wasting air at this point

Is there any way to die painlessly?

edit: first of, ty it's still a rough time. I've just been doing college work, but I just wanted to clarify that I'm a dependent and I'm very thankful for my parents' service regardless of the trauma they've caused"
"Can’t do this anymore. Too many mistakes that can’t be fixed. This will be my last post on Reddit. What a waste of a life. I can’t believe this is how it turned out for me, dying all alone. 18 years old, no friends, family, money or job. In my life I have accomplished nothing. If younger me saw me now I would be disgusted with how my life turned out. Life has been truly awful. I have meant nothing to anyone. No one will even know that I died. I’m not even a memory. What a pitiful existence. There’s a good chance no one will even read this and my last moments were spent writing something for someone no one even read. Good lord I messed up.

"Starting all the way back in the beginning of 2024 I thought my life was going great I just bought a house and I had a stable job. Life was good. Then comes Feb 5th my grandpa died and I loved him dearly. It was a quick passing he knew it was coming and even told me he knew it. I'm glad I got to talk to him for a while a day or so before he died. 

Then comes my bday Feb 21st. I get a call from my job telling me theyre firing me while I'm off. I thought no big deal I've got my parents to help out and I should find something relatively quick to at least somewhat pay for bills while I find better. I apply for unemployment and we were fine as my fiancé had just gotten a refund from her college for a few grand. Then comes 2nd week of March. Unemployment said they need 8-10 weeks to decided if they can even give me money or not. I thought no big deal I'll find something or somewhere to work. 

March 21st comes... My dad gets into a motorcycle accident. He had his spleen removed due to it rupturing, had part of his skull removed to relieve pressure on the brain and is in a medically induced coma. The doctors told us he might not make it. This was very hard on my and immediate family. 

Then at the very end of March I get a call telling me a company wants to hire me and they offered me MUCH more than I was previously making at my last job. I was so excited and I thought everything was going to be ok. I was going to get caught up on bills and start saving... WRONG at the very end of April after I had alr done everything the company had me do like a physical, drug test, background check. Normal things. I called on the 30th thinking I was going to get hired very soon and they ended up telling me they cut 3 of those positions and I was one of them luckily I called or I would've never known. So Im frantically looking for a job now. Luckily my dad is doing better I'm very thankful for that. He's in rehab and doing much better but still has some brain injury things going on like memory etc.

May rolls around and im still looking for a job. I've applied for SIX HUNDRED JOBS IN THE PAST 3 1/2 MONTHS AND 1200 SINCE NOV OF 2023 NO ONE IS HIRING I GUESS?!??!??!
I've had as many interviews as I have fingers on my hands. So idfk what's going on. I've applied for everything. Even shit jobs and no response. 

Im in so much debt I don't even know where to begin to start paying stuff off. No job havent heard anything from unemployment. Although I will say this the company that originally offered me a job got me another interview with them tomorrow and I swear to God if I don't get it I genuinely might kill myself. Everything is going so wrong and it's just all too much for me right now I just need one thing to go right PLEASE...

I know it would be very selfish to do this because I have a beautiful fiancé and dog. My mom just had her dad die and now my dad is in bad shape. So I know that wouod just kill her if I did kms. Im just venting because I don't want to dump all this on my fiancé plus she already knows that I'm having super rough time on and to top it all off her parents are mad at me for getting laid of and not having a job yet. I don't think older people who have been at a job for 20 years understand how bad the job market is rn. Alr that is all for now. Any words of encouragement or any remote job reccs or anything would help. Thank you."
"There is no point to my life. I have nothing to live for, I can’t see how it could ever get better.

I’ll never be able to have the life I so desperately want because every fibre of my being is repulsive. I’m so facially ugly all I do is isolate myself. 

I find it so devastating that no one will ever really love or want me. I won’t ever be an option for anyone. I’ll never be able to marry or have kids. I am completely alone and I can’t ever see that changing. I’m 20 and my life is already over. I feel like death is the kindest solution. "
I already made up my mind that I'm going to stab myself in the throat. I'm so fucking tired of this disgusting and annoying life of mine. I'm going to ask my doctor to put me back on Lexapro because it makes me really suicidal. I don't want to be here anymore. I hate this stupid life and I wish god would take the biggest dildo ever made and shove it up his funky ass! That bitch is really fucking annoying and controlling! I rather die than to ever be Muslim or Christian! I hate all religions! I can't wait until this shit world ends to! 
"Directly after I send this off, I'm hanging myself. I can't stand being a loveless, virgin loser. I can't. At almost 26 years old, I have missed out on so much and it'll be years, or never, by the time I actually find someone. I don't care anymore. I'm fucking done. Bye"
"My mom and I were discussing about Liam Payne's death (R.I.P) and the situation around it. My mom said ""it was probabaly suicide, too bad. People who commit suicide should just learn to deal with it. I mean, it's life."" It was just so insensitive and also wrong and hurtful that all my suicidal thoughts I've pushed down for months suddenly came back.

Edit: Thank you to all the supportive people, y'all are genuinely really sweet and understanding."
"This is actually insane how much of my time is spent on suicidal thoughts 
I can’t live this way anymore it keeps getting worse 
At this rate I don’t even have a second of my day without being suicidal 
Its been going on for months EVERY SINGLE DAY AND EVERY SECOND of my existence 
This is unbelievable"
I don’t know how to fix it.  But I’d rather not be around anyone.  Every person I’ve ever known has been evil.  There’s nothing I can do about that.  Not a single soul is good.
"my girlfriend has struggled with severe depression her entire life and has had 12 hospitalizations for SI. the first time she had an attempt while we were together it was absolutely heart wrenching. she was calling me from the hospital telling me that she was going to find a way to kill herself in there. i felt immense fear until she was home and thankfully, she felt somewhat better from a new line of medicine. three months go by and she’s in same position. she’s been bed ridden with depression the past month and i’ve been trying to do anything in my power to make her feel better. today i thought she was in a good mood and she went out to doordash. after figuring something was wrong after she turned off her location and told me she loved me and her plans to immediately commit suicide- my heart stopped. i immediately called 911 and went out looking for her. it was a scary hour but long short the police got her and have taken her to a hospital. these few hours living at home without her- and trying to sleep are miserable. her energy is my lifeblood and her comfort has saved me. i love her so much and i can’t live without her. she always tells me in episodes that one day she’ll kill herself or have the courage ect. it’s all i can think about. that i have a ticking time bomb on the love of my life. i can’t take the anxiety of it. not being able to hold her ever again is reason enough to stop wanting to live. i know im so dependent and this is my fault in a way i guess. 

i’m sorry this is worded horribly im tired and just wanted to vent. "
"Isn't that great? To have all of my problems, no matter how trivial they may be, solved in an instant..."
everything is so hard and unending and i dont get how other people can just get up everyday and live their lives and not want to die. i even like my job generally and i still get home and am unable to do anything else. i wake up work and sleep. i dont have any motivation ever. i just want to die. how can people actually live like this and feel some kind of happiness
"I don't think I hate world, the world is fine. It got its flaws, but its ok. But I am just not suited for this world. I think I am just an anomaly. And thats fine. I think anomalies should be get ridden of. I have given the life multiple chances, and have tried my best, but I have now realized it isn't the my lack of effort that is the issue, nor the issues with the world. Plenty of ppl around me doing good, even though they are suffering in many ways, they seem to be getting by. No. I figured out the issue. Its my mere existence. I dont belong to this world, I am not meant to be here. But I have everything planned now. No more failures, have failed doing the did before, but now I have a really good feeling about this. I think for once I will be successful in life, and that will be doing the best did that should have been done long time ago. I don't think I feel sad about it, it feels happy in a way. Finally I will be free and the world will be free of its anomaly. I would have said it was a good run, but it really wasn't, it never was meant to."
"While others just.... live because the world goes in favour of them.

And here we are, just from one suicidal person connecting with another suicidal person. 

What a depressing thought we live in."
"just tired. not much hope left but im too lazy to do anything at all. could i please get a biological off switch i can just activate instead of all that effort


or a gun, which my country doesnt have. ugh."
"Like an ideal scenario would be getting struck by lightning or getting hit by a truck. Yes that would still suck for my parents, but at least they wouldn't be left thinking what they could've done differently and could just move on with their lives. I wish I could die accidentally so no one could blame me for it, so I wouldn't have to worry about choosing to do that to my family. I don't want my brother to have to tell people I killed myself."
"I’m actually blown away. I’ve been crying since I got out. 
He kept expressing that I needed to go to the gym. He even brought up how affordable planet fitness is… 3 times… 
I know I’m way overweight but dude…. My therapist, someone who is supposed to help me, made me more insecure…. 
I understand going to the gym is healthy but the emphasis he put on me needing to go to the gym is inappropriate and made me feel worse about a lot of things…"
"This world is too much and tonight it clicked how tired I am of trying to be okay in it. I became a social worker because I wanted to mAkE a DiFfErEnCe and it's only highlighted to me how fucking fucked this society is. We witness/experience one goddamn traumatic thing after another, and then are expected to keep slaving away for fuckin pennies to barely scrape by. Every system is beyond repair. Self-care is used to gaslight us into thinking we're the problem. I am terrified and frozen to do anything remotely enjoyable or productive when I'm alone, and too much of a people pleaser when I'm around anyone else. And no, it's not the profession I'm in. I've been this way my whole life. I am tired of it. I am done. "

"This is my last day. I can’t believe I had hopes for the future. I used to want to become a doctor, get married, have kids, and now I can’t even see myself living until tomorrow. All my friends are fake and dropped me when I started dating a new guy. The guy I was dated sa’ed me. Im failing all my classes, my parents found my stash and haven’t spoken or fed me for the last 2 days. Im in my basement and have a rope. It’s already tied to the ceiling so I just have to do the final thing. I’m giving it 30 minutes. You can try giving me advice but it likely wont change my mind. Give it your best shot I guess. "
Really sorry 
"I’ve delivered my stillborn babygirl at 35 weeks of pregnancy. She was my first child. It happened two months ago, and with time I feel like I’m just drowning deeper and deeper. Nothing really helps. Nothing will return my babygirl back, and I’m unable to accept this reality. Also, my sister is pregnant and soon to deliver, and I just can’t imagine my parents hugging her baby, thinking they should have hugged my little baby and they never will. No one will. I’m seeing a therapist, attending support groups, and doing what I can. But nothing helps and it feels like nothing will."
"I (18F) despise myself from the bottom of my heart i want to remove my face with a knife i want to fucking burn it i want to soak myself in gasoline from head to toe and light my entire vomit inducing hideous body up.
Im so fucking deformed funny looking and unattractive 
My life is so worthless 
Im a ghost im completely alone because im so unbelievably ugly."
"I specifically took off work because I planned on killing myself today. I don't know if my husband and son sensed it, or what, but my son stuck to me like glue today.

I am just so tired. I wear a mask all day, every day. It even feels like I wear one in my sleep.  No one gets it. No one understands."
"I'm tired of the constant anxiety, always having to look down and be ashamed of myself with being born with such a pathetic dick. I wake up and take a shower and all I can imagine is cutting off this pathetic worthless part of my body so I never have to worry about it again. I never got a growth spurt so i'm stuck at barely an inch when soft, and \*maybe\* 3 inches hard and I have no thigh gap so whenever I wear loose clothing its pretty easy to tell. It's killing me that i'll never be good enough for a vast majority of women. Because of the way i'm born I have to go through trials and tribulations to find one partner i'm confident in telling about my dick size, without them laughing me out the door. While everyone else born above average gets confidence that they won't be laughed out \*because they won't\*. I've given up. I've heard all the solutions from ""find an asexual partner"" or ""get good with toys, or your mouth, or etc"" and its not that simple when you can't find a single person who can stick around without cheating on you. I'm not attractive enough to have a fwb situation either, so I can't just ""learn"". I know it's not all about piv sex, but a lot of people who give advice forget that a \*VAST\* majority of women will laugh in your face if you were to ever show this small of a dick to them. 

All my partners either asked to open up the relationship, or cheated on me after our first time. I'm done. I'm fucking done with being this worthless.

I'm finally going to find my peace and end it. "
"I have this permission to make this post so dont worry. My friend the other day was gonna take a bath but had the idea to commit suicide (drowning in bathtub) and he didnt tell me this. While he was doing it for about 3 minutes straight he noticed a faint white light then 10 seconds later noticed a VERY bright white light. Then he told me that he didnt even feel like he was in the bathroom, and felt like he was somewhere completely different, and heard a voice talk to him about how everything could go wrong if he commits suicide and also there was a little boy in this room he was in running around in circles. Afterwards he came out of the bathroom and his mom acknowledged he was in there for 45 minutes. I havent heard a story like this and i really want to get some insight on what this phenomenon was. This might not be for this kind of subreddit but he is very curious and i am too"
"Monday night I was texted my girl, she was out with her friend so I figured I would leave them in peace so I told her I loved her and asked her to hit me up when she got home. She replied she would and said she loved me. After an hour or so after I figured she would be home (roughly 6 hours later) I sent her a few messages, after the fourth one I sent one another saying I hope the reason your not replying is because you are safe driving. Immediately she responded no I've been home about an hour. She then tried accusing me of manipulating her, lying to her, just trying to get an easy fuck. I hadn't been doing any of that, but no matter what I said she wouldn't pick up the phone so we could have a real conversation. Then she said a generic goodbye and said she had to go she had work early. I couldn't believe it, I had no idea what happened, we went from planning a future together one day, to done the next. 

I was devastated, I hadn't felt that way about someone in 20 years (I'm 41m, she 43f) I had been living in the darkness for at least 10 years thinking my disabilities made it so I would never be happy again. She had pulled me out of the dark, I felt hope again, felt butterflies in my chest thinking about our future together, it all went away in an instant, it felt like the darkness came back with such a fury it would never go away again. 

So that night I took my pain meds and my anxiety meds and a quart of alcohol, while sending her a goodbye video while doing it. Then I lied down and went to sleep knowing by the time she woke up and saw it, it would be over. 

Well not much after I had fallen asleep I was awoken to three police officers and a firemen in my bedroom. I saw them and said fuck it didn't work yet. They told me the had gotten a call about a message I sent online, I thought shit, she woke up and checked her messages. Well they rushed me to the hospital and I got pumped and flushed, then had to sit there under observation for 7 hours while they monitored my heart rate. 

I told them I would not stay at the behavioral health facility there at the hospital, no shot. So they said I had to work with the crisis center people and have a safety plan to be released, so I had my mother come and be my safety supervisor. She found out from the police lieutenant that was on scene the had received the info from the FBI, apparently my SA video flagged their system and they alerted local PD to do a welfare check. I never knew that was a thing. 

So now I sit here in pain, miserable, depressed, lonely, with no hope for the future. I don't want to be here anymore. It's not fair. I've lived enough life. I want what comes next. 

I guess I can't post photos here, but I'll post my hospital bracelet and crisis support contract on my page as verification. "
"I dont have any interest in starting a life for myself. I dont want to get married, have kids, get a piece of land and have a small house built, those dreams mean fucking nothing in the end. 

Whats the point if Im going to naturally die and everything will be eventually forgotten??? Might as well get it over with by the end of 2024 for real this time.. 

Dont care if its a crap retail or fast food place I will make money and take an uber to a place I know in the middle of nowhere and do it."
"I’m planning to kill myself on 16th April which is one year since my mum died. I’m not sure how long I can keep living, I’m lonely and haven’t felt love since my mum, I struggle with drug abuse and depression I use drugs to escape I’m not happy anymore I don’t want to live. I don’t see the point anymore I stayed alive because I didn’t want my mum to lose a son and go through pain, but she’s gone now."
"I am a twelve year old girl. 
Tell me why I desperately want out of life. 
I need to escape. I want to rip the skin off my face.

Ever since I started school: I pondered on why I was different compared to other kids. Was I more mature than them? Yes. Was I more sensitive than them? Also, yes. My feelings were and still are intense: if I had one word to describe my mind, it's rumination. I never fit in. No matter how much I tried. So I mirrored their personalities. I don't know who I am anymore; I don't think I ever knew who I was from the beginning.

I have been through hell. I have been physically and verbally abused my whole life. I have been sexually harrassed and no one took my side. There was video proof of me screaming no because my ex-friends thought it was funny and cute. I am a victim of bullying. Everyday is miserable. It's funny how for the other kids, it was just a normal tuesday to them. For me, I dreaded waking up. No one loves me. Not my family, not my friends, no one. I'm not alone, but I am lonely. No one cares for me at the end of the day.

I used to be addicted to alcohol at ten years old. I started cutting myself at nine, or I did literally any self harm possible as long as I felt an unbearable pain. I tried to kill myself at eleven years old. I'm such a failure, not even my own suicide attempt worked.

I don't think I'm even living anymore. I'm just existing. I'm planning to kill myself in the summer.
Someone please help me. I need help."
havin a fuckin mental breakdown in the toilets at school. hrt is too expensive and complicated. i wish i was a real fuckin girl. wanna kill myself so bad im gonna relapse on cuttin when i get home.
even the most normal question from my coworkers like 'what did you do this weekend?' pisses me off sooo much. literally sit in my room and contemplate suicide is what i did. fuck me

I'm going to fail and die anyway. Why prolong the suffering?"
"If I had a fucking gun or something that will kill me quickly and painlessly like some sort of a pill that would instantly kill me, I wouldn't be here. Fuck this shit. Please, I'm so tired."

Ignore my name. What the fuck is the point of this hell I’m in. This hell really is worse than death. 

I had a stroke last year. I can’t functionally obtain a job. My girlfriend of over half a decade abandoned her post and left the rent all on my shoulders knowing I cannot live a lone without her support. Talk about cowardice malevolence. 

Apparently my chronic illness makes her hate me so now I can’t make up for it even if I want to  with her in no contact. You know what? I wasn’t giving up and I was trying at the pace I could to improve myself every fucking say. 

Now she doesn’t care if I die. I’m not sure if she cared that I lived. I have no family that cares. I have no friends. I’ve applied to fucking hundreds of job applications to do it. All fucking rejection letters. I can handle rejection, but under these circumstances it’s beyond a handle. 

I’m in pain all of the time, I can barely walk and I can’t think executively. I used to be a genius the likes that are statistically rare and emotionally unseen. Now I’m considered scum. I have no fucking money to cover any of my basic needs and the money I borrowed from an old family friend I’ve already used to cover what I’m supposed to. 

I’ve finalized my plan. I know what to do, and when. Rope on my pull up bar. I’ve practiced tightening and learning the noose. I have the rope soon.

Apart of me wants to permanently destroy those who abused and discarded my good, especially my now ex love of my life, not by with my agreement. Aren’t I a useless sadist. Her family took her and poisoned her that I’m not worth anything as a projection of their pathology, and narcissistic insecurities. 

Death will my relief, my kindness, and my retribution for those contemptible in it’s contribution. 

Goodbye. You fucking harlot of a world and, demons that embody the living plain. 


Edit: My rope hasn’t arrived yet in the mail. Until then, I’m chaotically docile. All the comments are some consolation. Those who declare me as a poet I find immaturely flattering considering I haven’t touched poetry for years. I find these come from a place of shallowly inflated attempts at altruism to save life. I don’t believe I am objectively demonstrative of that at all or capable, in my emotional turmoil. I’m not sure of the validity to these. I’ve received a lot of messages and they’ve been somewhat intriguing. 

I would love if I had a remote purpose in a job. I would be capable, of that. I was a copywriter before this and writing as my passion. I’m more likely just devoid of useful purpose. Likely a reflection of my life’s actions and their consequences. You are what you do. One could say I was destined for suicide. My plans seem to be in place still, for now. I’m not sure of another option to end the pain or make use of it meaningfully with what’s available to me. I’ve exercised all the resources below those of you have been referencing and encouraging.."

If I killed myself one day. Know that pretty privilege was one of the most fucked thing that happened to make me wanna die.
And before you tell me everybody's beautiful. 
I have no eyebrows and no eyelashes (trichotillomania) a big nose a big forehead short with bad eye sight. I have eczema. And I'm overweight. Kinda bald pixie cut black hair.
When I tell you that everywhere I go I get called out w nasty ass name and then they hit u with ""I'm joking"". Not my fucking fault if I'm not beautiful. Nobody cares about what's in the inside. "
"I know I just posted but fuck it here we go again one last time, I just donated the last of my fucking stupid material shit that I don’t fucking care about. My entire life as been pointless, I never helped anyone enough I never did anything for myself. It’s like I didn’t even exist. This entire fucking life was the worst fucking thing ever. Fuck my parents for not letting me transition as a teen and fuck this world for hating me for simply existing. Even if I didn’t transition I’d still be hated for feeling this way and told I’m a pervert for some fucking reason even though I have no interest in having sex ever, and I never will because I’m fucking dead now. When I’m dead my mother will blame it all on mental illness even though I begged and begged her to let me transition and even told her I would kill myself if I didn’t, and then I even did try it and still couldn’t transition. Fuck everyone who ever told me they loved or cared about me all my “friends” won’t even know I died, they’ll just think I stopped talking to them and then eventually make jokes saying what if they died and then forget I even existed at all. As soon as I post this I’m killing myself so LOL 😂 and fuck me too for being too much of a coward to ever show my true self, ever make any real friendships, ever saying what I actually thought to people because I want everyone to like me and now it doesn’t even matter because no one will even know that I died, that’s how fucking useless my life has been, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. Fuck god too for making me have these awful 18 years of life were I had to be tortured and sexual assaulted thank you God go fuck yourself for making me. I’ve hated life and now it’s finally over.

I know how pathetic it sounds but I really don’t know how to be happy because of this. I’m 20 and I’ve done nothing and it drives me insane knowing millions of people my age and younger across the board have sex lives and are doing that stuff while I’m not. I’m college age and I’m constantly reminded how regular sex and hookups are for people my age and the jealousy is driving me crazy knowing how far behind I am and what I’m missing out on. Especially when I hear stories of girls that have like dozens of different partners and I wonder how the hell im ever gonna convince one to be with me when I’m so much further behind their experience and a lot of the guys they’re arounds experience. Every guy I’m around has been intimate with a woman and I have no way to relate to anyone my age"
 I thought I'm already used to the feeling after multiple attempts but I'm still the coward I was during the first time. I'm so scared of the pain that's about to come by drowning myself. Some did said it'll be peaceful but there's no guarantee. I wish I had an easier option like overdosing or pointing a gun in my head but I have no resources. I want to reach out but I also know it's gonna be differetn this time and I really dont even like the result after imagining it. But I'm still too scared of the pain and death itself. And I feel so bad for parents. But I also hate myself too much. Can someone please just make me disappear.
"I've been suicidal for really long, since I was like 7-10, I've always thought about death. I've always hid it well though and kept it pent up inside until my mother found out from the school counselor, and told my father everything. His reaction was kind of unexpected, I assumed he would get mad and hit me but instead, told me that he would hand me a rope and dared me to hang myself in the living room. After that he came into my room and ""comforted me"" by saying how selfish I am and that he had given me everything people would die to have. It's been almost a year since this happened, everyone treats me the same as if it had never happened and thinks I forgot about all of those thoughts. It was kinda embarrassing for me so I guess this is better. "
"1) All the people who tell.i should live for them don't even want to talk to me and just try to avoid the conversation and shut me down every time I reach out to them.
2) if it's so draining to talk to me or deal with them don't tell me that me ending it will make you ""feel upset""
3) You can't live for other people you have to do it for yourself.

Telling suicidal people to live for you and others while simultaneously shutting them down and shunning them invalidates the whole thing."
"My country is at war. I can't legally leave it unless I have a lot of money. I lost my job this may because of the crisis related to war. I'm running out of money very soon, in 9 days exactly. I only have antidepressants for 2 days left. Then I can't even pay rent or buy food and I don't have anywhere to go because the war took my home. I have no friends and my family is extremely poor because my father is disabled and can't work. I have no choice now, I didn't kill myself, this stupid world it and the truth is that there is no one to ever help you because no one cares. Thanks "
"Is empathy becoming a rare trait? Are most people becoming sociopathic uncaring assholes? Why is everyone so hurtful?

I really hate the fact that I'll always be forced to interact with people and deal with them. I'm very sure that if people didn't exist around me and if I could've lived in my own isolated little bubble I, wouldn't have wanted to die."
"**EDIT: I am alive. After typing this out, I shut down my system and went for a walk. I called several mental health helplines and finally one picked up. The therapist seemed irritated with having to deal with me but told me something I've been hearing from people for a long time now: Focus on today. Eventually things will work out if I do the right thing from now on.**

**All the comments below seemed to indicate the same as well. You all are so kind. I wish everyone was like you and I also wish you are being recognized for being as kind as you are. I'm going to listen to you all and feel hopeful about the future. THANK YOU! You have saved a life. You have saved my parents from insane mental trauma.** 

Here's what I am: A porn addict, a student in the bottom 10%ile of his university, n thin and ugly guy, a 19 y/o weaker than the avg 14 y/o, an attention-whore and someone who lost all the skills and talent he was born with over time.

I've tried countless things. Nothing has worked. I have only seen my life go downhill. I'll just become a burden to my parents and then my friends.

There's no way I can justify the tuition my parents are paying to send me to college because I'm sure I won't have a job at the end of it all given my GPA.

Suicide is the logical thing for me to do. I plan to cut myself within the next three hours."

it’s not like i can relate to people on anything, anyway.

I tried to convince myself that everything would get better, but it won't. I can see that now, I was born with no redeeming qualities, and it hurts  so much seeing everyone around me with friends, partners, being happy. I just can't keep telling myself that things will get better when I know it's not true.

  
I started cutting myself recently, but I know its not a permanent solution. I'm going to let a nearby train run over me the next time it comes by, it shouldnt be painful I believe.

I guess I'm writing this here to leave a final mark, but I just know no one will even read it, and at best, maybe 1 or 2 people will respond. That's all life was to me, an empty void where no one was ever there for me, and I can't take it anymore.

Whatever happens, if you are reading this, just know, that whatever you are going through, at least know that it can't be more pathetic than my life was.

"Sorry if the titles a bit abrupt, but I think I’ve found my resolve. I I initially desired to wait until I got to uni, but I just don’t have it in me to wait. Things do not get better; adding onto this, I am so fundamentally flawed as a person that there is no feasible alternative even if I were to delay. Here’s the timeline of events.

-by 25th of September, I will finish writing my suicide note.

-by 27th, I will get my affairs in order (give money to the poor that I have, resign from my positions in school, etc).

-by 30th, I should have my last meal. I don’t intend to make things harder for other by committing suicide on a full stomach.

-on the first, I will jump in front of a train. This should be it.

After/on the first, search up for any disruptions on the Elizabeth line London.


I wanted to do this to prove that im committed. I’ve always wanted to do it, now I have to act.



I can’t do it, I’m reneging but I can’t do it, I want to do it but the risk of failure is too high. I’m sorry to everyone but it’ll happen eventually I promise but I need to find a way and  the funny thing was last night I was feeling happy I thought that being so close to suicide would make me stop but instead after today I’m just proven that things don’t get better. Sorry for writing so much sorry for the excuses but I will and when I do I will tell THE WHOLE WORLD except the people I know because I want to have done at least one thing correctly 🙏🏻


I’m not depressed, I’m just unhappy. I’m not mentally ill, I am just unhappy. I think there’s something really wrong ínside of me"

3 nights ago my girlfriend told me that she is suicidal. I asked her is there any reason and she told me that there isn’t and she just wants to die. I tried to be helpful and told her to think about the good things in life. She replied with “like what” and I said our relationship and she said sure but in a way she didn’t seem to care. She asked me that if there’s anything on my mind and I told her that i’m worried that I’m going to be a single dad but she said that at this rate you won’t even be a dad. I begged her to get professional help and she said that that she doesn’t want to. I don’t know what to do. After a couple hours she told me how she loves me and how grateful she is for me.

"You are seeing me half of my life struggling, unable to function like a normal person does, and you say to me that only pussies kill themselves because of one ""problem"". My disorder is just a problem which can be solved just like that, but hasn't been all these years. Well how about you SHUT the FUCK UP??? How about you stop being arrogant, apathetic, selfish pos, and start showing just a little bit of sympathy since I've been there for YOU all these years, ""living"" a miserable life just so YOU don't suffer or have to be ashamed if I killed myself. 

And lemme just say something about these ""mental health professionals"". Why do psych wards and psychiatrists even exist if mental illness is just a myth??? First they label you mentally ill, incapable of having a normal life. Then they fill you with all kinds of drugs. And then they are shocked when you attempt suicide and call you selfish, while they as ""mental health professionals"" should know that this is what happens when you are chronically depressed. And depression IS a MENTAL ILLNESS. It's in their books. Or maybe it isn't. Maybe I wasn't fit for this world. Maybe I'm just sick of this world and you should let me check out.

I'm so sick of being gaslighted. I'm so sick of being treated like some lazy nobody, while I've pushed so HARD just to live at this age while I should've been dead a long time ago. No matter how hard I try it will never be enough and at the end it isn't worth it. I should've killed myself already. It just isn't worth it. The only thing that saddens me is my dog. I adopted her to have someone to give my love to but she will be fine. She will be with normal people and away from worthless and pathetic human like me."

I (23) decided to go back to my hometown next week and visit places from my childhood. I can’t anymore. I’m done. I have no one.

I don’t care about my bachelors degree I’m studying right now. I always thought that I wouldn’t mind getting killed but I reached a point where I think about suicide every day.

I dont have anyone to confide in and i dont know, I feel lost as im typing this out and I'd like to stop crying and I feel stupid. I feel like I should just kill myself. Im thinking of self harming at this point. I dont even care anymore. I dont care if my family if disappointed in me anymore. I might as well yk? I just wanna feel loved and understood idk what else more. I would do anything just to be seen and loved for who I am not just who I pretend to be. I want to not fake it anymore. I just wanna feel satisfied. I just wanna feel content everytime I go home or talk to my parents because I just want it to stop. I dont know what to stop but just TO STOP. My crying has subdued na and I just wanna continue crying but my tears are gone and..I just found out that I'm not apart if the honors and I feel disappointed in myself but at the same time I dont. Please I just want it to stop. Please I would beg just to be understood and be content with what I have. To be secure and whatnot, like other families. Please. 

I feel grateful I really am, but since this morning I just wanna let go. I wanna feel content with what I have sure my family is what you'd call rich but I just wanna feel CONTENT. Thats all im asking please, please thats all im asking. I wanna feel understood even if I didnt get anything for my birthday or congratulations but just PLEASE I JUST WANT TO FEEL CONTENT. I just wanna feel understood. 

I know that I love too much that I always give my heart and all to those that those that dont deserve it sure but I feel lightheaded rn but I dont even care anymore. I dont care if my family if disappointed in me anymore. I might as well yk? I just wanna feel loved and understood idk what else more. Im  willing to beg to be understood more than to be loved. By anyone or anything I would just please. I wanna feel content. I'd be happy with anything given to me but even with everything being given to me, I feel like there's a void in the middle of me like I just want to ghost everyone and everything. I just want to feel like others; I want to feel accepted and loved without having to beg to be love nor accepted. Im okay with not even receiving anything from anyone but I'd just wanna feel loved and accepted. Im part of a big family sure but I feel so much like a fucking outcast that If you were to give me a knife with a choice to kill myself I wouldn't hesitate to do so. Im grateful yes, but I would rather not be apart if this family any longer if all I felt was the coldness given to me by my own blood. I would rather starve to death than  be accepted if this was all I would feel after growing up, even in stuffed toys I felt more comfort in. I feel more love coming and to my friends than my own family. Haha

If this was how I felt on my  birthday every year, I might as well just let go.

"It sounds crazy, but I’ve experienced enough to conclude its highly likely this is all just a simulation of some kind thats testing me. Like I understand its realistic for life to be hard, but alot of this is just ridiculous. Like a hard life would make sense, but this is psychological torture, like planned intentional torment designed by someone. Like for example, someone having to work hard to get by makes sense. But someone working their ass off, doing everything right, and then in the end it doesn’t even matter, and its all their fault, even though they did the best job they could with what they had. That’s psychological torture, planned and intentional giving of false hope again and again, and then getting them to believe that the blame is entirely theirs. That is not natural, yet it encompasses the mass MASS majority of what I experience here on earth. This suggests this is an artificial environment. Also the fact that so many people are very competent to speak language and become proficient with their careers and yet completely incompetent with extremely simple concepts suggests they are npcs in the simulation. More evidence this is a big video game. Some of us are real, the rest are npcs. You can tell by their ability to grasp simple concepts.

I may have signed up for this, I feel I would’ve done something stupid like that. Test what kind of a man I am, see what I would do when my memory of life outside the simulation is suppressed and sent in ignorant and faced in surmountable torment. I could see that, maybe reality is actually in the future and i was in my spaceship cruising and an ad came on saying

 “wanna experience the 20th century? The birth of the internet! The rise of technology! Live in a time when our oldest video records come from! See the funny selfie people and cat vids live in person! Try our 2000 simulator today! Your memory will be suppressed and you will experience the entire life from birth to death of a 2000er! Available in easy, medium and hard mode!”

Im the kind of guy who would chose hard mode, cause “ya, I can take it! Im so tuff! Roar!” Im a cocky idiot like that. I guess I could quit the sim early by suicide. But now that I know what it is, I think I want to play this threw. I can beat this video game, Im a pro at video games! Ok, lets play! I can win!😃"
"I just turned 30 a couple hours ago while sobbing on my porch. I just can’t take this pain anymore. 

I remember turning 10. I remember turning 20. I was equally miserable. I was equally suicidal. But I was still filled with hope that someday things were gonna change.

I used to think I was unlucky. That I had an unlucky childhood, unlucky relationships, unlucky timing. 

But it’s not a matter of luck. You can’t flip a coin a thousand times and always get tail.

Now I’ve been alive for long enough to know the problem is in my head. It will follow me everywhere. At all time. No matter what I do. 

I’m just a dysfunctional person with a dysfunctional life. I’m sick of it. I just want all of this to stop.

"I was raped as a young child (3-8) by my maternal uncle. I've been in therapy for 7 years. And I think I'm usally a strong person. But I feel like I reached a breaking point. I got so much adivce here on Reddit and followed the positive things. Therapy, talking about it with family,  police and so much more. Still.

 Police can't do anything as there isn’t any physical proof. My therapy can’t really be used as proof by the court. 

I've tried everything that could help in any way. 
I can't work because men still scare me so much. I can't go outside because in every man I see my rapist. I feel so trapped. I can't have a relationship because even tho I'm Bisexual intimacy with women is as scary as with men. I can't sleep because I'm afraid of my nightmares. I see him there every night. 

Logically I know I'm better but it doesn't feel like it. I just want a normal life. I want a relationship.  A normal family. I wish my parents and their families were safe to talk to. My mom's family is just abuser and abused trapped in the cycle. My dad's family doesn't speak my language and I never met them. I never actually met him. I feel so alone. 

Maybe my rapist was right. I am nothing. I will never be anything or worth anything. I just don't have any strength left in me."
"I can’t do this. 

Everything is basically “oh you’re depressed? Try this med. that doesn’t work? You must be bipolar. Oh no, you have BPD.” 

When it’s literally just the stress of being alive and living as a single person. I have tried over a dozen meds, and have had bad reactions to most, and no effect from the more mild ones. 

Antidepressants, bipolar meds, etc. I have had ALWAYS felt worse to me than being unmedicated.  I don’t want to be medicated, I want a life and actual help. But they just shove meds at you. I have to work 50hrs a week to make ends meet, can’t find any roommates, and I don’t have any internet est in life. 

The biggest thing is I want to die. Not die as in suicide, but I think about how it would be better to not exist. But these feelings aren’t met with sadness, but the only time I actually feel happy is thinking about ending it. I feel legitimately happy thinking about how I would be less of a burden to those in my life if I wasn’t here. I am so spazzy that I cause more issues than good things, and I have tried everything but I can’t just “change” even from therapy. Therapy just makes me feel like I’m doing the socially right thing, even if my brain isn’t clicking. 

I may have autism or something similar as I am always always overthinking and overwhelmed by anything changing, however due to my decent social skills they refuse to test me and I can’t afford a test. I am on concerta which help with doing stuff I need to do, but I have zero will to live. There is zero way I could live a life I want. I have cats to take care of that I didn’t want that my mom dumped on me, I have basically zero outside support, I am always at work. My job makes me so sore. I can’t find another, I have been trying. 


I want to die, because it is so much easier than this. All I have ever dreamt of is peace. Why is that automatically mental illness? I have accessed my situations, and now see the best outcome as dying. "
"Hi, i'm a highschool student. I've made a reddit account just to post this. My life is horrible and i had many suicide attempts but i couldn't do that at home so i'll do that not in school but in a restaurant's public toilet. I have a place where i can tie the knot and good height so it's good. I tried that but i don't know i haven't finished, but now im ready. There are 2 restaurants so i'll choose. The reason i don't do that at home it's that most of time parents are at home and i don't wanna find my body because they'll be traumatised. Hanging is my method. I'll do next week. Bye ;(
you can comment what might happen"
"fuck everything. Fucking pointless everything. Fuck socializing when people literally ask for friendship and they fucking ghost and then cry about it. Fuck people like literally I'm so fucking done with this bullshit Life. How the fuck I'm going to fix  my stupid piece of shit mistake of life if i don't even get a single sign of progress or that I'm doing anything good. I'm fucking done,  i did everything to be good, i did everything to fucking be something BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I DO DOES IT? No it doesn't. I can't go on with this stupid life.  All i have is my fucking alcohol and blades. Why couldn't i have died that night for fuck sake. God I'm pathetic."
"DUDE... I WAS A MOTIVATED AND HARD-WORKING STUDENT UNTIL THAT FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT DOCTOR BRUTALLY RUBBED MY PRIVATES WITHOUT CONSENT IN AN UNNECESSARY PROCEDURE (my visit was for something completely unrelated) .

Then, PTSD kicked in real bad. After fighting through initially, I hhI DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT COLLEGE, CAREER, ANYTHING... RN I AM FLUNKING OUT OF AEROSPACE ENG AND I FRANKLY DONT CARE AT ALL... I JUST WANT TO GET FUCKING SHOT OR RAN OVER OR SOME SHIT WITHOUT THAT MUCH PAIN... I LOST EVERYTHING... IF SOME GOD EXISTS THEY BETTER TAKE ME BACK IN TIME OTHERWISE THERE IS NO MORE HOPE...

Edit: Removed confrontational sentence and added some context now that my head is cool.

English is not my first language."
Been suicidal most of my life. Got out of hand while drinking to much. Shits fucked. Spent a week in there before bail and they put me on suicide watch. I know I'm in the situation I'm in because of myself I'll admit that. But they can't force me to stay in there. I'll probably be dead day one of being in there. I can't handle it. I won't put up with it. 
"Fuck I just threw up all over my bed, my stomach aches so much I feel so light headed, I should’ve listened to those people who said overdosing was painful "
"i know yall are gonna go thru my phone, im leaving  notes everywhere im so sorry. im so fucking sorry i was a bad kid im so fuckin sorry momma i love you with everything in me. 
and to my fiance.. im sorry i keep going insane. i never meant to hurt you, i tried to get better but i dont understand shit god damn it.
bubba im so fucking sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry i love you i love i cant say it enough im about to pass out i love you guys i love yu i love u i love you "
"I’m a woman and I hate being a woman because of misogyny, fearing I will get r4ped, fearing men… yet I can’t transition and live an easier life because 80% of the world is full of transphobes and homophobes that would happily kill me if they could. 
The fact that transphobic and homophobic attacks are massively praised and encouraged… 

I don’t feel like a woman anyways. I hate my female body and wish I looked like a man, I hate being the weaker gender, I’m not feminine at all and see femininity as something like “look at me I’m weak, I need your help”, like I’d be turning myself into a target if I were to go out in public wearing a skirt. I have masculine characteristics that I cant get rid of because they’re natural to me. 
I can’t do this anymore. "
"like the title says, im so very jealous of successful suicides. ive tried to go many times over but none seem to work. maybe it was the fact there was someone in the way of me dying, by calling ambulance or maybe the fact they’d convince me to throw up or help myself.

this endless pain is so much to bear and i dont want to live with it anymore, i want it to work somehow. i wanna lay down feel the grass as i go, as my body lays dead and my soul escapes this horrible thing we call living. as the ground beneath me slowly begins to swallow me ill finally be at ease with what has become of me. finally letting my life go. as all of these years replay in my mind remembering all the good and all the bad. finally im ready to go. if this is it or if theres another life i hope itll be more peacful than this one."
"I’m only 18, but I am terrified of aging. I literally can’t do ANYTHING to take my mind off of it. I don’t wanna look like a crumpled up piece of paper or have a sack of skin hanging from my neck to my chest. I don’t want jowls or arthritis or large eye sockets. 

I’ve been doing so much research trying to find out how much of aging is controllable through lifestyle. The skincare subbredits say that you can’t control it and that you are doomed to age. 

I don’t know what to do! "

"
Hey, I'm a 17 year old HS student and a girl in my class who found me somewhat relatable due to my quiet nature, started venting to me about her life and issues. Now normally i would never have issues with people asking for my help as i like to call myself the ""therapist friend"" but holy shit this isn't something i can deal with. I don't know what to do she just keeps talking about killing herself and nothing i say to her actually works. 

For context she's gotten numb after her therapist gave her anti-depressants (she's also 17) She said her dose was 100mg? Her family is messed up and from what she told me she's out of touch with reality, has issues with talking to anyone, fakes her smile and acts like a different person. She told me she often spends 3-5 hours max of her day just spending time in her mind?? Whatever she meant by that is up to your interpretation. She told me how she doesn't feel close to anyone or anything, her hobbies lost its meaning and her mother is an asshole who resents her own daughter.

 Can anyone please tell me what the fuck i am supposed to do? I know i sound like an asshole even typing this out but i am literally not qualified for this and i know i shouldn't even be involved with her dude.

Everytime we talk alone its her wanting to just commit suicide and i don't think i can handle this mentally anymore, is this wrong? Should i just stop being a bitch about this? I don't even know anymore."
"The only reason I’m still here is because I haven’t found a sure fire way to kill myself. I can’t afford a gun and all other methods seem either very painful or not guaranteed to kill (I don’t want to end up paralyzed or in a coma or something). I know that I’m just a burden on my family and I don’t see my life going anywhere. What few friends I have have all graduated and have jobs and lives, I’m still in school, have been for 6 yrs, and I don’t see myself graduating anytime soon. I’m severely in debt and I have no desire to continue living. Tonight I going to try running my car in a garage, hopefully that’ll do the job of killing me"
Context: we are both 15 male. He’s known for a few months now and recently he brought it back up and told me that he’s had at least 4 previous friends that told him that they were suicidal and he told me that he was tired of telling everyone to not kill themself and that if I was suicidal then what was i waiting for? He told me it was kinda cowardly that I haven’t done it already or even tried. I don’t really know how I feel. He is still my best friend but jeez dude. Advice?
"My son died in my arms last November and I can’t get over it. I can’t stop seeing him on the ventilator, hearing his last breaths, or seeing him in every other baby/toddler/kid I see. I just can’t do it anymore. There is no meaning to this pain or life anymore. "
"(f18) recently i’ve started self harming again after 5 years of being clean, i have no will to live anymore and i’ve stopped showering and brushing my teeth.. cleaning my room and i’ve not been eating or drinking enough. i’m old enough to know better but the only way i feel safe and comfortable is when somebody is looking after me, but i can’t rely on anybody because i feel pathetic.. not brushing my teeth has lead to me having to get surgery tomorrow and i just wanna cry and cry why can’t i be like every other girl"
"Its ridiculous to think about how happy i can be when im bout to die lmao, free from all trauma, fcked up life,etc but instead im gonna traumatize the ppl around me, that just didnt feel right but... im too tired to keep up with this"
"Hey there I am here now. After much back and forth i have decided to live on. Thank you for all your comments. They really helped me a lot to think about everything. Especially my parents. I don't want to make their life hell. So I have decided to not do it finally. I will try to live with a more positive attitude. Thank you everyone for commenting. 
But please help me guiding through life I have forgotten how to live. Please help me with this. Thank you everyone."
"Everyone says suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem. But, no, my problem isnt temporary. I've felt this way for over 25 years. Battled with chronic pain and illness all my life. Just got diagnosed with two more autoimmune diseases, one which is now putting immense strain on my relationship and just makes everyday life hard. 
I can't do this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. Isn't it selfish of others to want to keep me here? In agony and emotional turmoil. I'm not happy. I've never been happy. "
"Childhood was shit, full of toxicity. Now I struggle to be an adult. Everytime I try to better my situation I am fucked over by things beyond my control that send me into a mental downfall right back to where I started. I'm so fucking sick of trying I don't care anymore."
"I'm only 19. My mom killed herself a month after I turned 18, for multiple reasons. I wasn't taught anything about being an adult. I'm trying to figure out college, don't even have a way to get there. Or to work. Bumming rides off family that can't afford to keep supporting me anymore. At risk of being homeless because I'm full time and can't even afford rent anywhere, or a car. Living paycheck to paycheck, buying my own groceries. In medical debt because Goodwill doesn't cover mental health stuff. My first attempt was at 13 and my dad blamed me for it, despite his abuse and emotional neglect from both parents being the cause. I also weigh the most I ever have now, and thinking about starving myself like I was at 14-15 on Prozac, that's the skinniest I ever was. My blood pressures too high to even treat my adhd with stimulants, nonstimulants don't do anything. I have binge eating disorder just like my mom did, also keep buying cheap things I don't need, like she did. I have a box full of my pills that I stopped taking, because they just numb my pain and don't make me want to keep living. I looked up the overdose effects of each, and longterm if it doesn't kill me. Basically I need to have my first beer with them, it seems. How is anyone supposed to get by under late stage capitalism. Inflation, low wages, expensive housing, expensive cars, expensive food, no fucking free healthcare because if you're not a wage slave, you don't deserve to live. It's not worth it here, anymore. It never was. Gen X pulled the ladder up behind them and some millennials were able to scramble up before it was raised fully. Gen Z couldn't even reach it. Alpha is cooked, unless gen z somehow fixes it. "
"I made a post about wanting to be a ghost before on here but not wanting to die a while ago on here. Like the idea of dying without dying is one I have a lot especially after I turned 20, but I thought that was just a norm? Maybe this isn't the best subreddit to ask but genuinely do most people not even consider it? "
"It's like I keep coming up with reasons that it's more logical to kill myself than stay alive. 

1. Why be an emotionless husk when I could potentially reincarnate into a happier life?

2. My circumstances are the reasons for my depression, but there are only so many externally forces you can actually control.

3. If the afterlife and god exists, that makes my life pointless because I'm just going to reincarnate into some worthless fag in the next round. And I hate people who AREN'T me.

4. If there is no god or afterlife, then I'm embarrassed that I'm this shit-slinging ape-type life form instead  of something with enhanced intelligence and invulnerability.

5. I cannot use fiction as an escape anymore because it makes me feel like those worlds are real and I could go to them if I offed myself.

6. People who circlejerk how beautiful life is, funnily enough, make me want to kill myself even more because of its absurdity. They don't actually believe that, they're just under the influence of simple caffeine.

7. If the all loving source is real and it feels better than being alive...well idk guys. I thought spirituality was suppose to make me want to live, not convince me to go. 

In short, human beings cannot make up their minds and I'm embarrassed to play along with you.

Edit: sorry for formatting, I'm tired rn."
"Around next month it's going to be my 23rd birthday. I can't believe I've faced this hell for 5+ years. It never got better ever. 

There's no happiness. Everything is just cope. So many tears wasted. Oxygen wasted, electricity wasted, energy wasted, money wasted, for me to end up in the same hell I was in 5 years ago. 

I don't get it."
I wish I could have just done it once I realized how much of a born loser I am. I did buy a gun- nope simply cannot pull the trigger. I bought fentanyl. I cannot ingest it. So here I sit taking the L. relationship bullshit. faildaughter. once thought to be the golden child- LOL. 
"I've never had a job or worked for a paycheck a day in my life, I'm 25 and my parents have been supporting me financially while I dropped out of college then got into a different one. One has to work in some way or another to feed and house themselves, which I would have to do after I'm done with college. But I don't want to, I don't want to do any sort of productive activity at all, I don't even want to finish college. If you don't work in some way or another, you can't feed or house yourself. It's not something I hear people say at all, but homeless people are basically people who are left out to die. I'm not sure why I should wait for that to happen rather than just dying now."
"I want to commit suicide, but I'm worried that if there is an afterlife I'll go somewhere bad. If the Christian god is real he's evil. I'll probably be forced to be with my abusive mother and then when the rest of my family gets there they will all yell at me for dying just like when I was alive"
"idk 20m, kicked out of the house years ago. my job, which was shit anyway and i was crying and thinking of kms to get out of there every day, fucked me over and said they won't pay me anything for two full months of work. it was the last straw and i tried to kill myself but unfortunately was saved, spent 2 weeks in icu. got out of icu and was met with the news that i'm evicted bc i didn't pay this months rent (i had no money and was in the fucking hospital). now homeless on the streets, no money, starving. reached out to my parents to borrow some money because i have no one else to turn to, no friends no other family nothing. conversation turned into an argument and i confessed in the heat of the moment that i'm not good mentally and i tried to kill myself. she said it's a shame that i failed and i should try again bc i'm a failure and there's nothing good for me in life. i think she's right bc i can see no other way out. i'm on the street no clothes or posessions no way to get a job like this. there's nothing else to do. idk "
"I'm so fucking tired of how suicide is taboo, how I can't find like-minded individuals to talk to, how people always think talking about suicide is about either encouraging suicide or suicide prevention.

I don't fucking need anyone to talk me in or out of offing myself. I have about a thousand different ways ready whenever I want to do it. Hell, I could jump out the window from my 15 stories high apartment anytime.

I just want to be able to talk to someone without there being worries or people trying to talk me out of it. Being suicidal is being gaslit by the entire world because they think I should abide by what they think is best for me.

My first trist with suicide was when I used to hang myself by the neck from the closet bar using a very thick sheet, just for sheets and giggles. I was 4. There has always been that impulse for ending my life there. Most of my life I had to spend every day trying to convince myself that life is great and beautiful and worth living and that is really tiring.

The main problem with suicide is the people who get left behind, I get it that they suffer from the loss, but I suffer constantly from living. Sure I'm trying to diminish their suffering, so I don't intend on jumping head first from a window, because I know they'd like a not-mangled body to mourn over, so there's that. But in an ideal world, I'd just put my affairs in order, go to a facility, have all my blood and organs donated and then die peacefully.

I'm just so sick of not being able to talk about this."
It’s not true. You’re always going to be alone in your heart. I will always feel that deep sense of regret right down to the marrow in my bones. That feeling that every cell in my body knows I’m not meant to be here. I’m not allowed to feel unlonley because there is nothing here for me to be apart of really and truly. Nothing that can fix the stain I’ve caused on the earth. That there is no one and nothing I can do to fix or be fixed. Except for take myself out of the place I never belonged in the first place. So yes. I’m always alone. Always. In my heart. And in my life.
"im tired of this, i cant do it anymore. my ocd has brought me to a point of despair i can’t any longer fight

i would do it, now if possible. i ask God for all the forgiveness. but i don’t want my family to suffer, i can’t pass this pain to anyone else. everything hurts

why me?"
"I could continue to abuse my body in the ways that I’ve been doing. I could exaggerate my suffering hoping that would be enough. I could get down on my knees and beg for someone to listen. I can scream and cry all I want. No one cares. Only when someone kills themselves, there’s some semblance of sympathy for them. I won’t be difficult to grieve and will be quickly forgotten by most, but it will still be the most anyone has ever cared for me, and I take comfort in knowing that."
"I won't be here tomorrow so I emptied out my bank account and gave it to someone I saw sleeping rough on the street.

One last good deed."
"I am having a hard time. The only thoughts I’m having are “I fucking hate my life” and “I want to die”. I am having so much anxiety about dumb shit, I might lose my job. I just don’t know what to do. I would never actually kill myself because I don’t want to hurt my loved ones. It’s so shitty that I’m only alive, not because I want to be, is because of other people. Living like this is miserable and I don’t want to deal with it anymore. I feel like it’s not going to get better. "
I wish i killed myself at 14 years old. At that age i already suffered more than enough. Nothing got better
I've had by all standards an exceptionally good life and my only aspiration is to end my life how do people go through hell and want to keep fighting to be alive.
"I hate that he did that. I’m so angry that he didn’t at least try to get the help he needed. He’s the one who told me suicide was a sin and he still committed suicide.

It doesn’t make sense."
"Honestly don't know what the point is anymore, the only advice I've ever heard was ""open up to people"" because ""people care"" but I just learned thats clearly not true."
Jumping off a building seems way too scary what if I regret the fall I dont know guys what to do.
"I don’t want to work. I don’t want to study. I don’t care how much I spend. I don’t want to make my bed. I don’t want to cook or clean. I don’t care about chores.

I don’t want to leave my house. I don’t want to see anyone. I don’t make sense, I don’t want to talk.

I can’t get myself to shower. I can’t get myself to brush. I can’t get myself to eat. I can’t get myself to sleep. I cant get myself to leave. 

I can’t cope with reality. I stay safe in delusion. I keep hiding but the consequences are catching up. I know what to do, I can’t get myself to do it. I don’t think I care."
"God. They always tell you to get help but then the second I started talking about suicide to my new therapist you can tell the mood changes and suddenly you know you need to shut the fuck up and stop talking about it otherwise you’re going to get locked up.

I don’t like their tone and their “safety plan.” It’s so funny because they forced me to come up with 3 people for my safety plan. I put down my parents (who have no idea I’m suicidal) and my sibling (who leaves me on read and doesn’t give a shit).

What’s the fucking point of getting help if this is all it is? Like seriously?"

"In my opinion, there is nothing good about this fucking world at all. Nothing. Everything sucks in one way or another. Every single moment of conscious existence is pure AGONY and TORTURE. I can’t stand all this fucking energy building up inside me with nowhere to go. This life is SO FUCKING BORING. MY BODY IS SO FUCKING BORING. Nothing in this world is fun at all. You can’t fly, you can’t explore the galaxy, all you can do is walk around on your big human legs and consume food and water. That’s LITERALLY IT. Why does existence have to be so fucking bland and sinister? Why are we FORCED to eat other organisms to survive? WHY? Everything is just so fucked up and I’m DONE. I don’t care about trying to enjoy my life anymore. I don’t care about myself anymore. Life is torture and agony and pain and nothing else. We make up the concept of fun so we don’t go insane. Nothing is real. Emotions are made up, love doesn’t exist, anger doesn’t exist, happiness doesn’t exist, the only thing that exists in this disgusting world is PAIN. I can’t stand being Stuck inside this limited human body for the rest of my consciousness. I can’t stand interacting with other humans who are rude and don’t give a shit about me. Nobody gives a shit about each other, and nobody loves each other at all. We create mannerisms to hide how evil we all are deep down. We would ALL kill each other if we were forced to, and with no hesitation. DISGUSTING. I don’t feel safe in a world like this. Constantly on edge. Constantly on alert. WHY CANT MY BRAIN JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP FOR ONE SECOND AND LET ME REST? When this world is about to end, and I see the big meter crashing down on the planet, I will be laughing my ass off. I hope it happens soon."
"Title, basically. I wish I could tell my friends and family that if I kill myself, it's not their fault and they shouldn't feel bad about it. But I can't because that's gonna fuck their shit up. 

I wish I could talk to someone about my mental state without feeling like a cruel freak. I'm not asking anyone to fix me, just to talk to me like a normal person. Suicide is a lonely state of mind, I wish there were people I could share it with without hurting them."

I hate looking in the mirror or looking at my body and just feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I don't want to deal with any of this bullshit.

"hi! my name is amelie, i’m 13 years old and i live in england.
i’ve had suicide on my mind for awhile right now. i don’t have reason to live.
i’m anorexic, have sleep and social anxiety, undiagnosed autism &amp; a lot of trauma. nobody cares. and i’m literally not just saying that. i barely have any friends and the ones i do i don’t feel a social connection with. even if my plan was successful i don’t think anyone would grief.
before people comment “you’re too young to be on reddit” ive most likely seen more then you. i’ve been groomed &amp; online sexually abused by 20+ people, both female and male, blackmailed and fetishised, as well as stalked. i can’t live with the pain anymore. everyday i wake up and i just remember it all. i can’t deal with school. with family. with eating. with anything. nothing is fun to me anymore. 
my plan is to stash a fatal amount of paracetamol on halloween and give my parents the impression i’m going to a friends house. i’ll probably go to a park and take the pills there &amp; just wait.
will it work? i hope so. will i go through with it? i’m not sure. maybe.
thank you for reading i’ve only posted on reddit like 2 times. i might delete this."

I wish I had different parents, I hate it I hate it so much I don't know why this is happening to me.

"The thought of suicide takes up so much space in my brainand it’s been that way for years. I’m rotting. It always comes back, it has for 10+ years, why shouldn’t it? I’m starting to believe some people simply aren’t made to be alive. I might just have been born to die."
"i always wanted to die, i just gained reason to life in try to get money and able to move to an isolated peaceful place surrounded with just nature, with how i am now lacking motivation or to be honest, effort at all in anything. ill remain poor and broke. 

i treid to die, it both fail, i drink medecine 2 tries increased dozes from 4 to 16  to try overdoze but no, ofcourse it dont work i just felt awful the whole day and puke. latest was i try to strangle myself but it somehow didnt work. it was fucking painful fighting your survival body instinct and the feeling of suffocation and chaos with your own self. its not easy to die, and im scared to try slit my neck or run into traffic or jump because through failures i realized i might just make a scene and survive again. and possibly just live less limb or paralyzed. if only i have a gun, and could die instantly easier."
"Firstly I hope that this doesn’t offend anyone, it’s not my intention. I lost a grandma to cancer and a grandpa to the aftermath of it. I want to get it because I want a legitimate reason to kill myself. For now it’s just that I’m ugly as fuck and way to short for my age. And that’s without a medical condition to blame on it. I also feel worthless and just want to die. I don’t know if it is an attempt but I tried to drown myself in my bathtub this year and realised it wasn’t the way to die for me (I’ll probably shoot myself once I can buy a gun). I wanted to ask if it’s weird or something to wish for that? 
P.S. thanks for the comments no matter the topic I really appreciate all of you
Edit 2 I’m very sorry if I shoved bad memories from loved ones that passed by it into their mind again
Edit 3 I think there was some misunderstanding, I do NOT want to suffer from the disease but a legitimate reason to kill myself"
"As dramatic as it sounds, it's true. The family I prayed to God to protect everyday has killed me.

TL;DR: my dad cancelled my flight ticket back to Canada so now i may never get into my dream school.

At this point they might as well throw me into a well and let me starve to death in peace cause there is no mending the amount of betrayal I feel. Once I was told this I was at loss for words. I had to park my car and scream so loud people passing by were shocked. I am as good as dead I'm telling you. I begged this man, send me one month's allowance and I'll go back to Canada without bothering you for more money. I haven't even thought about first and last month's rent or anything really. I just want to be in school and figure it out later. I've already told them, if you think I was mentally ill before, now it's time to run mad for making me lose an opportunity to go to the school of my dreams and if that puts me strapped in a hospital for years, so be it. My life is as good as over anyway. There is nothing for me anywhere else. I am fucking sick and tired of being sick and tired. I've talked this over with my therapist and he said my parents are wrong for this and in the end it doesn't even matter cause once I'm gone I hope they burn in the deepest pits of hell. I have literally no one on my side. I am tired. 

Edit: someone said I felt ""entitled"" and I'm looking for attention and I should go get a job and student loans. I'm $50k in student debt and I had a full time job that they made me leave for the ""vacation"" they promised me only for my vacation to turn to jail time. If you think I haven't done anything to avoid this from happening to me, you're wrong.

Another edit: they literally told me that I was coming to relax and I shouldn't even work so Ofc I thought to myself that a ""vacation"" will be a nice reset. But unfortunately I was BAMBOOZLED. I'm telling you there's nothing I haven't tried the last 12 months, like literally nothing. Nothing at all.

Edit 3: also considering he cancelled a flight that I paid him for and now I'm asking for one month's allowance which is less than full refund amount, I'd say that word entitled doesn't even apply. I'm literally willing to live in a shelter if things don't work out. Nothing about me is entitled, I've had to work for everything I own, he's never had to pay for my clothing or lifestyle since starting uni. My first phone was from me, my first car was from me. Entitled people wouldn't even be able to survive in my family.

Edit 4: before even purchasing the ticket this man promised me and said all I had to do was NOTHING and I'll be well taken care of with a good allowance cause I won't be here for long. Now all promises have been broken and now I have to ""prove"" I'm worthy of furthering my education? The people calling me a spoiled rich kid are actually funny af you guys shouldn't be having kids tbh.

Final edit: *SUICIDEWATCH* a subreddit dedicated to suicide prevention has people telling other people to go ahead and do it. I went from being ready to die (still am) to wanting to rid the world of some of you online psychopaths.

*deleted joke* Honestly, I want to thank the few of you that have been helpful, I hope the same kindness will be shown to you and your family in everything you do. Thank you so much! "
"Life just gets to much you just want to lie on a curb and drink or use drugs and watch the days fade away until you die. Not really I've been homeless and I've done enough drugs to know it just makes you feel worse overtime, but I understand wanting to just lie around and watch life fade way everything is just too much stress."
"How can people just mute or block you without any second thoughts, I cry myself to sleep every time something like this happens, yet I end up to be the one apologising for being hurt. Guess I am just not cut out for life"
"I’m 15- I’m 16 soon, life’s been crap since I was born.

My dad gropes me up and hits me if I tell him to stop, he does worse to my mom and she literally won’t leave so I need to stay too :(.

I hate the fact I’m seen as an object by majority of guys, it’s made me hate myself so so so much.

All the hate towards woman everywhere, the sexism, the misogyny, the objectification- it’s too much, I can’t cope.

And I feel like social pressure is worse as a woman :/, I get called ugly for wearing no makeup.

I hate being seen as a sex object, I don’t know anymore, I hate myself so much.

"You can hold it. It looks different for everyone. Some people it's a gun, rope, knife. My death is a bag of pills. 

I've done my research (and a test drive as it turned out) and I am 100% confident that this is a good few times the lethal dose. I fixed an error (leading to the first ""test run"") so I'm very sure this will kill me. They told me it would have last time, if the error hadn't happened. So I've fixed it, fairly confident in my success this time.

I do have many regrets. Not being better, not doing better. Does the good that I did outweigh the bad? Will my heart go against a feather? I have doubt, but whatever I get I deserve. Maybe I'll end up back here. That would be ironic. 

I will see my family one last time tomorrow evening, it's a special event. Family is visiting from overseas so I can have a proper farewell, although they won't know. I look forward to it, and then going to sleep one last time.

There is an issue I need to solve beforehand but I have all of tomorrow to make a plan for it. 

Maybe I'll go with my original solution but I am debating that. I'll figure it out. Thank you guys on reddit for years of entertainment, hopefully this is my last post."
"25F. Already tried to kms once. They said if I tried again I'd go straight to the psych ward. I don't want that to happen.

I'm planning on hanging myself tonight when everyone is asleep. How do I make sure I don't fail?"
"hey
I hope you're doing well even if you're on this Reddit
 I am from Germany and am 19 years old (boy)
 I'm going to take one last warm shower now and then kill myself in a very safe way.
Before that, those who want to can read my story about why I do it. First of all, I'm sorry for my bad English

grew up in a small village in the north of Germany. had lots of friends and was happy. A mother who only wanted the best for me and an unfortunately emotionally disturbed father who experienced very cruel things in the millitary during the war but never received any therapy. So you can imagine how he threaded me.
I would say I looked pretty good, but when I turned 14 I got bad acne. My big sister had the same problem and was given accutane, a heavy medication that helped a lot. So my mother said I should take it too.
so I started taking it when I was 14. It helped but unfortunately I had a bad doctor and side effects. The medication caused my growth plates to close early. I'm 19 now and 5'7 and when I was 14 I was also 5'7. my mother is 5'8 and my dad is 6 f. Not only did it destroy my growth, which is very important in today's society, it also caused me to lose my hair. When I was 19, I had very thin hair and a receding hairline. I then met a girl online with whom I have written a lot and am still writing. She lives 5 hours away from me. I think I fell in love with her. But I was so insecure and I thought I needed a full head of hair before we can see us in real life. So I did a hair transplant when I was fucking 19. I put all my savings into it and an unethical doctor made it for me. The results are very bad and my hair looks much worse than before.
Making that was the biggest mistake of my life and I regret it every day. I feel incredibly guilty.
So to summarize, I'm 19 and haven't done anything since school. I have a family where my parents argue loudly every day and everybody is disappointed from me. I took a medication that inhibited my growth and i destroyed my hair through surgery. The girl I'm in love with will never fall in love with me. I have nothing, I screwed everything up. I isolated myself from all friends and stopped all my hobbies like football. My day consists of waking up and waiting to go back to sleep. Guys don't throw away your life because of your look like I did. I wish I could go back in time and accept my hair and my skin without doing medication and surgery.

I was in a clinic for 3 months, I had therapy and everything but it didn't do anything for me. I could tell you more details about my life, such as the fact that I did competitive sports or my relationship with my ex gf, and my diagnoses. Then people would perhaps understand my decision even more clearly, but that would go beyond the scope here.
THANK YOU to everyone who took the trouble to read this.
I'm going to take a warm shower now, then listen to music and finish it. I don't want to die but I'm so worthless I can't take it anymore.
all the farewell letters have been written. Goodbye, you're all beautiful, you can do it, but I can't. You are worth to live I'm sadly not.
~NJG"
I’m done. Lasik destroyed my life.  No more joy. Only sorrow
How do you do it. What's the point of pushing every day if I'm too stunned to reach my full potential. I can't sleep without substances. Constant nightmares. Flashbacks. My mind goes to it every morning like a check list that needs to be checked off. I'm broken. I'm depressed. I push everyone away or I'm used like a fool. I can't enjoy life like this. I'm miserable every day shit I'm 27 and still cutting myself to cope 
"I recently realized that I've been fooling myself my whole life that I just have to keep 'trying' and someday I will overcome all of this. In reality, all my tries are pathetic.

To hell with dreams. I won't even have an average '5/10' life because I'm broken and nothing will ever fix that. The only thing left for me is to take drugs to make anxiety and life tolerable and to end everything when that stops working."
Idk how to feel. Ya she was toxic. Ya I dumped her cause she was manipulative and controlling. But isn't this just how anyone would be on the edge of their life? I'm really trying to keep it together. I just feel so responsible. Ik she always joked about it. But it never felt like it was my responsibility to stay with her just to save her. I thought she would realize her ways and get better. Find someone who could be what she needed after me. I didn't think she would give up. I didn't think I'd be her last chance. Am I to blame? Should I have been better?  Could I have prevented this? My mind is racing. I feel so bad. Idk how to overcome this new thought. We weren't even irl dating. Just online. I thought that made it less real and less impactfull. I didn't realize how wrong I'd be after...
"(F19)

No matter what I do I don’t think I can ever have anyone care about me as much as I care about them. I don’t know if it’s a fault within me that makes me hurt and grieve in excess as well as love, but it feels like everyone I love probably couldn’t care less about me. 

Maybe I’m paranoid or insecure but I don’t really fucking care because it’s the truth. I’ve never been the first choice, not in friendships, not in relationships, not in my family, not even in the school playground playing football when we had to choose teams. 

I don’t care about the “live for yourself💕” bullshit. If I cannot be loved then I do not want to live. Simple as that and fml. If I died today I’m convinced only my dog would care or notice my absence. "
"I don't really care anymore... I'm a depressed ugly korean american girl whose poor still poor... always assumed to be chinese.. called asian slurs and jokes. especially during covid treated like shit punched and hit. Physically abusive parents who were very strict never got to do anything. growing up with no asians around me especially my own age was sp isolating and lonely.. good bye going to hang myself.. fuck all you assholes who physically attacked me growing up. Good bye

"Last night i downed 7 tablets an hour or so before bed idk what i expected to happen but whatever it was it didnt happen. I took 2 more just now and im wondering if i’ll die while at school or ill if my liver will fail and ill be in ungodly amounts of pain. Whichever the one please help.
UPDATE - told my mum, she booked an afterschool appointment to the doctor and she thinks i was just trying to self medicate or skip school"
"I've been struggling with alot of false accusations and my mother calls me a disappointment. I wanted to join the military but my family doesn't  support the idea to say the least.I recently thought I escaped this shit cycle but it hit back like a freight train. So these will be my last word I wish the world to know. You all are amazing people and deserve better there is no such thing  as a failure just a broken person. Keep  hope for the next generation to come because their  gonna need it.

Update in alive and out of a phsych ward I'm now homeless but I don't know what I did wrong my family disowned me I'm doing better mentally I'm in a homeless shelter and I eat well"
"It's currently 3:20am for me. At exactly 3:30am I will hang myself. I've thought very hard about this for months, and I'm going ahead with it. I just have one last message to the world: 

&amp;#x200B;

Dear World,  
  
  
As the shadows of mortality cast their relentless grip upon me, I pen this farewell letter drenched in unyielding sorrow. At the tender age of 20, my fragile existence teeters on the precipice of annihilation, consumed by the relentless march of time. The cruel irony of my demise at such a young age serves as a grim reminder of the inevitable fate that awaits us all.  
  
Within my veins courses the bitterness of unfulfilled dreams and shattered aspirations. I stand at the crossroads of life and death, a mere spectator in this tragic play. The world, once brimming with possibilities, has revealed its true nature - a cold, heartless dominion that revels in the suffering of its inhabitants.  
  
Oh, how I long to have tasted the sweet nectar of life's joys, to have savored the moments that others take for granted. Alas, fate has deemed me unworthy, casting me into the depths of despair and snuffing out the flickering flame of hope that once burned within.  
  
As I prepare to bid adieu to this cruel existence, I am haunted by a sense of profound loss. The dreams I held dear, the love I yearned for, and the experiences I craved shall forever remain distant fantasies, forever denied by the cruel hand of destiny.  
  
In my final moments, I am left to ponder the meaning of my short-lived existence. Was I but a mere pawn in this cosmic game, destined to suffer and fade into obscurity? The answer, it seems, is a resounding affirmation of life's inherent cruelty.  
  
And so, World, I bid you farewell, with a heart heavy with regret and shattered dreams. May my untimely demise serve as a somber reminder of the fragility of life and the injustice of fate. As I surrender to the embrace of eternal slumber, may my absence be a haunting testament to the relentless torment that plagues the human spirit.  
  
  
Yours in eternal despair,  
Simon S

"I don’t care what anyone thinks. Other people might have wonderful lives with my conditions (fibromyalgia and hypermobility). Good for them. I don’t. I’m 25, I struggle to walk without help, and if my employer wasn’t as understanding as they are then I would be fucked. I can barely climb fucking stairs and I’m supposed to like/be proud of this horrible, ugly, barely functional body. I hope I die tonight because I can’t stand this any longer. 

I don’t want to hear from you if you’re from the online fibro community and you already know why."
"I need some understanding and simply how to handle this horrific thing. He's 26, used a shot gun and shot his face. He's stable but will never be the same mentally and physically. He seemed so okay. Owned his own home, and car repair business. His new girlfriend may have been a big factor. He had just broke up with her the day before. His father passed away (maybe overdose 2 years ago and was an alcoholic). He dropped out of school after  getting into a good college because of drunk driving charges and pills. I'm not sure of those details but my sister was a cop and got him out of most everything like jail time or the cops reporting things somehow through nepotism.  He became sober- (had 5 years in AA), and had a sponcer and sponcered others. I'm devastated and so sad. Please help me understand this better and be a light to my sisters and her mom and his siblings. If this isn't the place to post, I apologize."
"we were hitting it off, he's so nice and exactly my type.. even though i was out of his league, he still kept assuring me that i was enough and it made me actually feel loved. but that's exactly why i had to turn him away. it's selfish to make connections like that when you're just going to hurt someone. i feel so bad and i bet he feels like he did something wrong but i wish i could be happy and be with him - but i need to set my focus on getting what i need to kill myself so i can have peace. i want a boyfriend so badly, but even more than that i just want to die"
"I'm inside the school bathroom with my earpods wrapped around my neck, I fucking tried to kill myself for good, i still have left a mark, this night be the first and last post here"
"A month ago, I planned to end my life today. I booked a private space so that I wouldn't be stopped by someone happening upon me, this issue that had halted my last three attempts. I put together a pack of drugs which I knew would end my life and ease my way as they did and placed it in the bag I carried everyday. I put together a second pack which I hid in my home in case the other was found. And I waited. Waited for Christmas to be over so that my little boy wouldn't associate it with my death. Waited, as I had promised, for a mental health referral to go through and be picked up. I'm a month on and my little boy loved Christmas. The mental health referral still hasn't appeared. And I am sitting in the space. And I have the package of drugs. And for now, just for now, I am not going to carry through with my plan. I can't tell how long this will last, nothing has changed. And I still believe that we would all be better off without me. But I can say that today I will not intentionally end my life. I still know that as I increasingly struggle with my symptoms that I will get to the point where it will be more detrimental to be in my child's life than leave it. But today is not that day. Today I can still cope well enough to not be harming those I love. I don't know how long it will last, but for now, I'm here."

I'm just a pain and a waste of space I don't feel like trying anymore 
"Sexual stuff. 

I’m here a lot, I know. Well, I fuck up a lot. This is one of those times. I (15f) sent nudes to a guy (16M) and he used me. Just like a fucking idiot, I gave him what he wanted. He wanted pictures and he got them. I really fucking liked him. Doesn’t help that Im hypersexual. 

Anyway, he sent me a video of himself…cumming. And then he stopped talking to me. 

I’m such a fucking idiot. He knew exactly what I liked, and used it against me. He manipulated me, and I let it happen. Fucking pathetic. 

Don’t be like me. Naïve, stupid, dumb, a whore. 
I am no better than a whore. No one will ever truly love me. This just proves my point. 

I want to kill myself. I need to. I deserve it. I’m quite literally just a waste of space, oxygen, and various resources."
I'm scared of myself because I have these strong urges to have sexual relationships with my dogs I didn't get them by choice my sister owned them before I moved in and now I'm scared that one day I'll act on these urges but my real question is how do I approach the topic with my therapist to get help before I sucum to these disgusting thoughts any ideas fellow rediters?
"Recently, my suicidaI ideations came back and they're stronger. My mind is filled of thoughts having my existence erased or just dying almost all day. But I could never kiII myself. There are so many factors that i can't even explain myself. I just want to not exist anymore. Like dying but without kiIIing myself and without the pain. 

Of course I want to get better but the dark thoughts are always the one dominating me. I feel alone in this battle. I have no friends anymore and people around me are emotionally unavailable. I don't want to live a miserable life. "
"It's been 48 hours I'm worried that I'm gonna survive
I've been reading through articles and they says if you went 48 hours you might survive. I didn't drink much just a really really tiny amount cuz I was too much of a pussy and that burning sensation stopped me.
Considering drinking more so I can die. At least in coma, if it didn't have enough acetone for me to die.
I'm getting nausea but I can't tell if it's from something else and anxiety like always or the acetone poisoning.
It's been 48 hours so I don't have much hope that it was that. I accidentally drank it as a child and still survived.. maybe I should  find a better way
The only thing giving me hope is the word MIGHT the fact that I **might** survive after 48 hours.

Update: I could feel my stomach twisting and it hurts like hell but I'm still alive.

Update 2: this day is getting worse and it's so tempting to do more. Tried to eat pencil lead out of stress earlier. I know it won't do any serious harm at all, I hoped it somehow did. I don't honestly care if I would just get serious health issues and not die. If I did get serious issues, at least I could use that as an excuse to escape. From the start my main motive is to escape. For people telling me to get medical help, it's not that easy to do so plus I'm too anxious and awkward."

"I'm tired. I'm an ugly woman in this world. I've never blamed anyone for it, I've never blamed my parents for it, nobody. I understand. I deserved how I was treated. I believe it was valid. So before I blow my brains out this wednesday, this is my final message to this world.

My mother and father had four children. I was the second oldest. I've always been treated like the oldest, I always had to do things that the oldest was supposed to do since my older sister had a learning disability. From a very young age, I knew that life was different for me. Do chores, take care of my siblings, do good in school, repeat. I wasn't allowed friends--not that I had any. I was bullied by all till I graduated high school. Yes, I was what you would consider ""abused"". My parents would argue, and my mother and father would blame their issues in the family on me and of course I would be the person to slap, punch, and kick around. I never faulted either of them for it. It took me a really long time to come to this realization. I wasn't abused. I mean, who would want a monster for a child. I was and am grotestque. I am deformed. I am repungent.  
I don't fault them for beating me. My mother passed and my father continued with where he and she left off, until I left home for college. In college, my eyes were opened. I was obese, black, and a disgusting woman. I decided to lose weight. And, fast. I did it anyway I could. I lied about having ADHD, I lied about my substance abuse problems, and I got adderall XR. I took it everyday, played just dance for 2-5 hours 1-2 time a day. Paced back and forth and got on Edtwt to keep up with weightloss tips. And, it happened. I got ozempic. 

That was the catalyst. I got down to 117lbs. I was really depressed and started picking up on tips from my parents and others around me. The universe actually guided me to it, really. Maybe being nice to others wasn't enough, maybe I should hurt myself to undo some of that bad luck? It just started hitting myself with a belt on my arms and legs, but the welts weren't enough. I needed more--I needed to see myself be hurt. I needed to prove to everyone that I wanted their approval. I want to be good, I want to be normal. If you hate me, that's all right. I can be that, I can be whatever you want, I just don't want to be rejected. Please don't reject me. 

Then, i got some racist roommates. That was another sign. I needed to cause myself more pain. I needed more to rectify the bad karma. I started hitting myself with the buckle, anywhere that it would work. I'm black so I needed to see bruises. It took too long. Then, I realized, I needed to cut myself and let my blood flow. It was light then deeper. I used to be afraid of even injecting myself with needles. Oh well. 

The bad karma never stopped. Then I said, maybe I'm the problem. If I remove myself from society and don't interact with humanity then this would stop, right? No, it followed. Humanity followed. It got worse.

This isn't some victim blaming post for my life. If anything, I wanted to apologize. I want to apologize to my mother and father for being disgusting and not dying when my umbilical cord wrapped around my neck. I want to apologize to my siblings, and my younger sister for blowing up her phone so much. I'm sorry that I treated you as my only friend, you have your own life and it's not your responsibility. I'm sorry to the people I've tried to be friends with, I'm disgusting I know and I will never bother you again I promise. I'm sorry to my bullies and poor crushes from highschool and middleschool. You guys will never plague my thoughts again. I'm sorry to all the college roommates who've had to see my face in the morning, evening, or night. I'm sorry to my cat, clyde. I'm sorry to my therapist and psychiatrist who I lied to about the extend of my issues. I'm sorry to all the men I've ever thought I had a chance to. I'm sorry to my basketball coach. 

Everyone, I am truly sorry for being alive. I'm gonna do it in my dorm room, so everyone at my school can get free tuition and pass for the year after I do it. That way, at least I did some good in the world.

And, the very last person, is Emily. My only friend. You helped me, you encouraged me, you were beside me from kindergarden to now. You were right. I should have never been born. I wasn't supposed to be alive.  You taught me to lie, to please others, to sacrifice, and when I go, you will be the only person who was ever truly honest to me. I love you so much."
"Every minute is torture. I have never had a few happy days in my 29 years of life. I am not as good as others in the simplest things. I am not good-looking, not very tall, introverted and awkward, and I have no love and no future. If someone can kill me, I will thank him."
"I’m sitting in a pool of my own blood and the only thing you can tell me is “Let’s do some breathing exercises”? Are you serious. I feel so hopeless, I’m forced to go to therapy almost 3x a week after my last attempt and they can’t help you if it’s anything serious besides anxiety and depression.

“Therapy only works if you put effort into yourself!😁” I FUCKING CANT, I can’t help myself if it’s an actual personality disorder that destroys my everyday life. There’s legit no help, I’m being watched 24/7 and have no freedom. When I do actually want to talk about my feelings it always turns to “Well that might lead to a hospitalization” then how am I supposed to get help if I’m going to get locked up at the end and be 100% worse?"
i have done nothing but bedrot since allegations against my only comfort. i then fell into a deep depression and have been like this for months now. i cant leave. im so tired but cant sleeo. if i eat i throw up. my only safe place is guitar. i cant take it anymore. my gf the only comfort after the allegations then left me and blamed her issues on me forcing me into counselling. this weekend every bad thought will be gone.
"damn 

for real nobody gives a fuck about me except my mom 

I was born lower class too . Like the bottom . 

So it’s like I can wage slave or try to make income other ways 

But what for ? There’s nothing to fight for. The world ? I can help make the world a better place, sure . If i’m staying alive for anything it’s to try and brighten someone’s day . Or help support my aging mom . I live to serve .

But with this fucking crushing loneliness and abandonment , it’s hard to find a reason to continue fighting . The world doesn’t want me . Nobody cares for me , if I died today nobody would be too bothered at all . 

If I continue to live, it would only be to serve the world. I exist only to serve . There is nothing in it for me, there is nothing here for me in this world , in this hell . All I can do is try to put out some of the many fires in hell, so to speak

Because for me, this is hell. Truly this is a nightmare for me . All there is to do is help extinguish some fires in hell as best I can . Help make someone elses existence a little easier . 

But it’s really really tempting to just leave . Would it be selfish to just leave earth ? It FUCKING HURTS , AND I’M SO FUCKING LONELY AND UNWANTED 

I guess there’s weed . And electric wizard albums to listen to. And cats. Cats are cute"
"I would rather be dead than gay. I don't understand why I can't like men the same way I like women. I feel NOTHING towards guys and it devastates me. I want a normal life where I look like a girl and have a husband and kids. I don't want to act out on my attraction to women. I don't understand what's wrong with me and why I don't see myself having a boyfriend or a husband in the future. I wasn't traumatized, I don't hate them, so why am I so repulsed by that idea? Why can't I just accept that I'm supposed to like men? To top it off, I also live up to the stereotypes. I am, indeed, a masculine woman. While I do think that this is not correlated to being gay (otherwise femme lesbians wouldn't have been a thing), it doesn't help that I'm both masculine and exclusively attracted to women. I'd rather look like a normal girl so that I could increase my chances of getting a man instead of doing what I genuinely want because sometimes people want what isn't good for them, and this includes me wanting to be married to a woman in the future.

I feel in love (unrequitedly, though) with someone who I would have considered to be perfect. She was everything I could have asked for in a woman. The happiness I experienced was indescribable. Lately, every time I experience the slightest bit of attraction to someone of the same sex as me, I have thoughts like ""I shouldn't do this"", ""I shouldn't feel that way"".I do not want this gay  stuff anymore. I don't want to look at women the same way straight guys look at them (as future girlfriends and wives). I want to perceive people of my gender as just good friends and nothing more.

Honestly, I'd rather kill myself than give in to all of this. I don't understand what happened to my brain to make me feel attraction to my own gender. I want to have a normal life and forget all of this gay stuff ever happened. Start anew. Forget about it as if it was some cringey teen phase that took too damn long to end. I don't understand what the fuck is wrong with me."
i don’t really know who to talk to about this. is there something wrong with me?
"He was my whole entire world. He gave my life meaning and something to look forward to. I was nothing without him, now he's gone and it's all my fault. I will never find another partner. I'm ugly, annoying, stupid, clingy and loud. Nobody would ever find me attractive. Even if I find someone else, I don't want them. I only want him. He was perfect, handsome, funny. I'll never find anyone like him. He made me feel like I belonged, he made me love myself for who I am.

I don't have a reason to keep on going. I have nothing to look forward to in my life. I have no friends but I had him. I'm all alone. I miss the good times we had, I miss his love. I'm not permitted from talking to him or else I can get in serious trouble. Part of me wants to believe that he'll come back to me but I know deep down that he won't. I have no one to go to.

I have nothing to live for. He was my everything. I'm somewhat afraid of death but I cannot live without him."
"I’m 20 nb and have nobody to really talk about this with, so I’m sharing here. I have severe self harm issues, and always always imagine my sweet death while I harm. If I just moved my cuts lower down my arms it would be a death sentence. Things in my life keep piling up, and I fail at each and every one. I can’t even have a healthy relationship with a person because I chose to mutilate my body daily. My pets keep me anchored here to a certain extent, but I know it would take me a day to regime them and erase myself when I finally commit. "
"I want to kill myself so bad, but I hate that my family and friends will probably blame themselves. I want them to realize that I just hate life and there was nothing they could do. I don't enjoy anything. I'm tired all the time. I hate my body. I just want it all to end. "

"i’m 13F and my ex boyfriend is 24M, kinda illegal right? well, its all my fault. every time we did something sexual i consented. we broke up cause of the police, and now he’s in trouble cause im a slut."
"I’ve come to the conclusion lately that I do not want to live and function as an adult. I shouldn’t have to have any commitments or responsibilities. I should have died age 7. My life has been downhill since then. 

My parents loved - and still love - me so hard, it makes me hurt inside. I don’t know if that makes sense? I refuse to look for romantic love because the only people I want to care about are them. The more years I spend masking my true self (because nobody - nobody - would ever suspect I’m like this; me, the attractive, successful career woman who has bought her own apartment and been living independently for over ten years), the more I want to give it all up and just move back in with them and totally regress. I want to regress to the age I was when I didn’t know of negative emotions, or anxiety, of grief and loss. I want to be ignorant. I am both saddened and filled with rage that growing up happened. I want it to be just the three of us forever. To play with Barbies with my dad in the garden. I want to see colours as brightly as I used to. I want my mum to hold me tight. The love I experienced in my childhood is like a chokehold. On a bad day, old memories is all I can think about. I cycle through them in my brain and cry until I have no voice left.

Nobody asked me if I wanted to be an adult. Nobody checked with me. I watch my friends get married and have kids and I’m like why. Why do you want to adult so badly? How sad that you are now taking care of your own children. You should still be children yourselves. Why the fuck are we getting older?

And then, because everyone seems to be going down that path, I start thinking ‘What gene am I missing that I turned out so wrong?’

I would like to die a dignified death with my parents in a couple of decades’ time. I can hold on till then if I know I get to go with them. I fully intend to end my life as soon as they go, but I am hoping that they might be interested in looking into options of going the three of us at the same time.

I really wasn’t meant for this world."
"Found out my bullies is living her best life..Getting everything I wanted.  I WANTED. while I'm here stuck.  Poor. Uneducated. Feeling unloveable,  worthless. Unable to get job. Depressed. Suicidal.. And fucking social anxiety to the point where I couldn't leave my house. All because of them... I fucking hate them. I'm done with life. Bye everyone."
"- I did the best at any given time with the resources that I had available.  
and I am proud of myself for it.

- This is a very reasonable and humane response to the situation.

- I actually never thought I would be able to make it past 10.   
made it to almost 20! heh.

- Too early in my life,   
It was too late.

- To the world I never got to know,   
Good Bye.

---------  
Papa,   
- You were supposed to protect me, love me.  
- I never got to cry in your arms.  
- I wanted-needed you to be there.  
- Every time I watch a father hug his kids I am reminded of what I didn't get to have.

- Maybe you just never tried or maybe you did and your best wasn't what I needed.

- But then I am remember, you did the best with the love that you knew.  
you did not fail me, The world failed you.  
and I was just collateral damage.

- *I FORGIVE YOU*

---------  
Mama,  
- I just really really wish I could go back in time and give your younger child self a hug.  
- I wish I could play and laugh with you and tell you it will be okay when you were a kid.  
- life was cruel and so unfair to you and none of it was your fault... but what happened to me most certainly was your fault.  
- But...Its Ok.  
  
- *I FORGIVE YOU*

---------  
Ishu,   
the *BEST sister EVER,*

- Everyone has stars, but they are not the same thing to different people.  
-for some who are travelers, the stars are guides.  
-for others they are not more than little lights in the sky.  
-for others, who are scholars, they are problems...  
-But all these stars are silent.  
  
-*You — you alone — will have the stars as no one else has them!*  
*-* In one of the stars, I shall be living.   
- In one of them, I shall be laughing.  
- And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night…  
-  And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content to have known me.  
- You will always be my friend.  
  
- *Thank you so much for existing*

- I am very sorry.  
- Good Bye.

To all the strangers who took the time to read this and might feel compelled to say things like ""please don’t do it""

I hope they wander the Universe I never got to see!"
"It does not get better when you’re poor. It just continues to get worse.

I can’t fix my car, so I can’t get to work. I can’t get to work, so I don’t make enough money. I have to go on public assistance, which the state I’m in makes as demeaning and awful a process as it can, so I feel about two inches tall and it doesn’t even cover one month’s expenses.

This is not the first time I’ve felt suicidal. Even when things were better financially, I thought about it. It’s a mental illness I’m sure (but guess what? I don’t have the money to see a therapist or get on the right meds to handle it). 

Still, every time I feel this way, I think, “I wish I had killed my self back then. I wouldn’t be dealing with this shit now.”

So holding on for a better day seems pointless? When I know I’ll feel this way again and wish I had done it now to save myself from something worse."
"I’m exhausted. It’s a never-ending cycle of yearning for financial freedom and living life to its fullest. 
All the things that make me happy are things I can never afford.

This is so fucking cruel man I’m tired"
"Everyone everywhere is always so annoyingly ""positive' about everything I hate when people who seemingly have never struggled in life Tell others how to be happy it always seems so toxic because they always say that stuff as if it was just something you can change like that, yea I know ""it'll get better"" but that doesn't mean that it won't get bad again I know I'll feel better but that doesn't mean much if I'll still feel like this again after some time everything hurts I feel guilty for the smallest things I feel like I'm an awful disappointment of a son I have no friends no real hobbies and no hope, no I can't just tell myself that ""hey I'll feel a bit less bad in a few weeks"" and be fine, knowing that I'll feel better again doesn't make me feel less awful now
I don't want to be told that life is ups and downs like I don't know that, I just wish the downs would be a bit less crushing 
(Nothing against anyone here just want to clarify that you're all awesome idk what I'd do without the little bit of support from here)"
"I used to make fun of porn addicts but now I've become pretty much a porn addict myself, and I consume excessive amounts of it. I masturbate excessively and engage in other sexual activities (nothing extreme, just online stuff) to cope w my own misery. Whenever the male species try sexually hitting me up, I usually ignore it, but nowadays, I can't even say no to them, man. I've been depressed for 4 years (though w the time being of being w my bf made me feel alive again), but I truly think I officially reached the peak this year. So many bad things happened in 2024 with my parents talking divorce, my 2 year long loml abandoning me (without saying a word to me)  at the lowest point of my life on valentines day, my mom finding out that I'm suicidal and endlessly torturing/tormenting me for it, I developed schizophrenia and my physical health issues just worsened and became more painful, Ive gotten even more addicted to self harm, etc. The year barely began, and I'm alrd getting hit w so many problems lol I can't take it anymore, bro. And now this disgusting sexual problem of mine is making me more motivated to kms lmao. I'm definitely not staying alive any longer."
"It is final.I am 42 and I finished writing my suicide letter. I bought most of the things I need to kill myself.I am very, very, very, very, very sad! I know this is going to devastated a bunch of people. Please please please pray that Jesus will have mercy on my soul!! Little over 4 months ago I was severely and very seriously attacked by someone suffering from dementia. I also picked up some very everything's not long after. I have 24/7 completely unbearable pain. Even very strong pain medication does nothing. I am very serious ligament and cartilage damage. Cartilage isn't something that can heal and my country doesn't provide very advanced treatments. I can barely use my arms to do anything. Had to stop working because of my severe injuries and pain. 💔Even the most simplest and easiest house chores gives me pain. Just holding a cup of coffee in my hand gives me pain in my elbow.Both my shoulder, both my elbows, both my thumbs, both my knees, my upper and lower back is very, very damaged and in more pain that you will ever believe. It's permanent injuries and the pain will drive any person on the planet to insanity. I've always managed to cope in any situation. But not being able to use my arms without extreme pain, not being able to help my very old parents, not being able to take walks, not being able to play with my sister's children and not being able to experience any form of Joy anymore. Are things I cannot live with and will never ever be able to make peace with. I know I'm being punished for a lifetime of addictions and not having a proper relationship with Jesus. I will give up everything I own and sleep on the floor for the rest of my life if I could be painfree again and use my arms like a normal person. The physical pain has gotten so, so, soooooo bad that I cry most days because of the intensity of the pain😭 the only thing that can perhaps give a little bit of improvement for my very severe injuries.Is growth hormone or stem cell therapy. Both therapies has its risks. Lot of stem cell therapy is not legit and there is even been cases where people went blind. Rather, human growth hormone (HGH) is proven to treat joint problems rather than cause them. Research shows that following the administration of HGH: 93% of studied patients experienced “excellent” results from HGH injections as a treatment for joint-related problems. The treatment is not available in my country. Going through 10 minutes of this pain is a nightmare😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I'm sending you all lots of love and I wish I could send you all a very expensive coffee with two large chocolate chip muffins and a long hug.I hope everybody's dreams come true. Please pray for me I feel like screaming and crying from the pain. Not even cortisone or marijuana products give relief. Besides cortisone damages cartilage and ligaments even further😭😭💔 no one can help me. My elbows, shoulders and knees are making crazy shooting noises. Please, please, please, please, please ask as many people as humanly possible to pray for me.My name is Burger.You can delete my post if you want to. I can't be the son, brother, friend or uncle I used to be! God please have mercy"
"I threw away my sex toy today, so that one day, when I decide to end my life, it’s less embarrassing for my family to clean up my room. I also registered as an organ donor."
"It's just the way it is. I have literally no choice. I am in constant agony in my own mind, my body always hurts and I have never had friends, nor love from anyone. I have no choice but to cope with this reality by accepting that I'll always be coping from an always existing suffering. People are quick to throw platitudes and give advice like therapy and what not without realizing what you're going through...it's just harsh man. 

I am TWENTY EIGHT and I have been like this my whole life. I don't know how anyone copes with this shit, I'm barely hanging on by a thread."
"im 17. im a failure. i have bpd and i cant control my emotions, i push people around me to their limits and i feel like theres nothing i can do to stop myself doing that. like im watching myself make the people i love's lives miserable. im failing college, im shit at my job, i smoke cigarettes and weed, and drink. i blow all my money of cigs and vodka. i have no goals, no dreams and no aspirations. i wanted to be a mum one day, i really did, but i dont want to bring a child into this world knowing they will likely have the same mental struggles as me. id never want to put anyone through that. im going to hang myself. ive tried 5 times to kill myself before. 3 previous times ive tried to hang myself, once i chickened out, twice ive gotten to the point of blacking out before the belt or rope i was using came loose. 2 previous times ive tried to od, but that seems to be a pretty useless way to go; it doesnt work. tonight im going to hang myself. one of my parents is probably going to find me. ive left them a note. i know im a burden. i know i ruin everything. i left a note for the man i love too, although he doesn't love me right now. im going to have one final cigarette and then im going to die. and im okay with that.

i think for the first time in years im finally calm."
"To anyone feeling like they don't want to be here anymore, you're not alone. I've wanted to die for years now, but every time I see others like you in pain, my natural instincts kick in and I can't help but cry and think, wow, I'm not the only one and I want to help all of you, but I know I can't because no one can help me either. Life's a bitch for people like us. If people around you make you feel like you're misunderstood or worthless, you're not, because I know what it's like. I've gone through depression, anxiety, BPD, bipolar 1, suicidal ideations, addiction, abuse, self harm, and more. Sometimes we just need someone to hear us, but what's more important is when others KNOW what we're going through from personal experience. I'm not here to tell you what to do or what not to do. I'm just here to let you know that we're in this together whether we know eachother or not. Your feelings are valid. I hope you find peace one day, I'm still waiting for mine. I don't know if I'll ever get the balls to kill myself, but things aren't getting better. It's not looking good for me."
"I just want my time on earth to come to an end
I'm trying constantly to look decent and do hobbies and stuff but the fact that I'll never be loved, cherished and desired bc of my unfemine body and monstrous face is beyond me. I'm so done"
"I'm a 31 year old guy that never figured out how to become an adult. I hit all the points that made sense till I became an adult. I dated in highschool and had a bunch of friends. After that it began to fall apart. 

I was single after highschool but became afraid to meet new people and interact. Slowly my friends dwindled or went to live their lives. Start new families. Start new careers. I remained stagnant. Couldn't hold down a job and never and still never feel good enough.

I tell myself when I have money I will start trying to date again, but my self confidence is destroyed. I live in perpetual stagnation, but time still progresses. I just don't feel like I have any other choice. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this. Maybe to hold myself accountable and put it out rather than letting it fester in my mind as my insomnia holds me hostage into the sunrise.

Nobody feel the need to respond. I just wanted to see if anyone else felt that way or maybe had some idea on what I could do. I just feel the loneliness taking hold and feel myself being pushed to that dark edge of reality. All I do is dream of a new life in a new world where I can be and do what I want to do since I feel like it's too late for me now.

Edit 1: It's hard to respond while I'm at work, but I am reading every single comment. They mean a lot to me to know others feel similarly. It's bittersweet knowing that so many feel or fear the same for themselves. It sounds cliche, but I don't want anyone to feel this way. I'm deeply sorry for us all, but I don't have an answer. We're not alone in this though and maybe that counts for something?

Regardless thank you all for commenting on this posts resonation with you. Thank you for sharing with me. I really appreciate it."
"Well here I am in a place I never thought I'd be in a million years. (just like many of you)  As the title says I've been with my one and only wife for 33 years now and 2 days after Valentine's day she tells me she's been unhappy for about as long as we've been married.  It was like I entered some altered universe at that second.  I'm almost speechless just trying to process what she said, and then she says we're over, let's get divorced.  No warning of ""hey, let's talk, or hey, this is bothering me"".... nothing.  I asked where all this is coming from and if she's feeling this way we should try whatever it takes to save our marriage.  She told me she's done with being married and that she wants to focus on herself at this point. We have 2 great kids, a nice house in a safe neighborhood, and some awesome pets.  Kids are happy, do great in school, and never wanted for much that we couldn't provide.  In fact, our house has always been a happy place, pretty much homebase for all their friends when hanging out.  We've been together since meeting in high school and have rarely gotten into any arguements over the course of all these years.  Friends have even commented on how we have it so good and are so lucky we don't have to deal with all the typical, immature BS bickering that comes with being a couple.  We are still living in the same house together and for the most part are pretending that she didn't crush me by unloading all this on me, all while we had a movie paused.  It just seems so unfair that she wouldn't enough respect for our marriage to at least bring up whatever is bothering her so we can talk about things, and seems even more unfair when there's 2 kids involved as well.  When I ask questions to try to make sense of any of it she says, ""I don't know what to tell you, or ""I'm just don't feel like I can talk to you.""  I'm like, ""it's me, what do you mean?""  Then she just comes back with the whole, ""I don't know what to tell you, I'm just done.""  Never in my life have I felt this kind of pain and confusion, like I got totally ambushed, and she's typically super sweet and nice all the time so this is just impossible to wrap my head around.  I've been so in love with her since we were 17 and still am to this day.  She's completely perfect to me.  So long story short, I get it now, I get how we end out wanting to end everything when life can throw you the worst curves that beforehand you thought were unimagineable.  I wish life had an easy ejection button, just want to dissappear forever.  Thx for reading"
"Exactly what the title says. I (23 f/nb) can't do this anymore. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for almost 20 years and it's never gotten better. I finally have the courage to act on them.

From infancy until fourteen and a half I was sexually abused. My birth mother was involved in two different child sex/porn rings (or a big one? or one and then independently pimped me? Idk. We moved and it didn't stop, but at this point that detail isn't super relevant) until I was eight. I'd probably had over one hundred sexual partners at that point. When I was three, I caught an STD from her boyfriend and my grandmother took me to the hospital from the resulting UTI. I went septic. I know I should feel lucky to be alive but I wish I had died. My grandfather and uncle also started using me sometime before I was five, which is why it didn't stop when I stopped living with her. My grandmother was the only semi-decent person in my family and when she had a severe stroke, leaving her a shell of her former self, when I was 11. I lost any semblance of family I had left at that point.

I had enough when I was around fourteen and snitched to a guidance counselor, who got me put in foster care. Nothing super horrible happened there, but the damage my birth family inflicted had been done. I was professionally diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder at 15 and was a problem child due to my traumas and inability to deal with them. At one point I was put in a group home to work on trauma focused CBT and I completed the therapy, but it hasn't helped. I've been in therapy for over a decade (my bio family was threatened with my removal by the school if they didn't, but I didn't think I could tell the first therapist what was happening) and I'm still the same mess I was when I was getting abused. I was on meds, but thanks to the memory aspect of my illness, I'll either forget them or forget to refill them, thus making the concept of medication useless. I've been in psych wards and group homes so many times, and I always feel like I come back worse.

I'm turning 24 this year and none of it is getting better. The only reason I'm not dead yet is that I have two cats who need me. On top of the DID, I'm a severely depressed, anxious, and probably psychotic alcoholic who keeps reliving their worst moments on repeat. I'm scared of everyone and everything. I have nothing to live for except my two cats (they deserve better than my mess). I have a fast food job where I like the people, but I work in a small-ish space where people are constantly bumping into me, which is a huge trigger. I can't fathom how bad things will be during the busy season. I can't help but think I squandered any chance of a good life I had by going into foster care and letting my trauma/mental illness take over my life (my abusive grandfather had a college fund and big dreams set up for me and now I'm nothing). 

The only thing I've ever been good for is being useful to others, and my best friend is in a financial bind. I get paid tonight. If I buy a hotel room for Thursday and the supplies to end everything, I could send him the rest of the money, help him out of the hole of bills he's in. He's told me before that he'd take my cats if something happened to me (think like, jail. There was a period where that was a possibility, but I've verified it would apply in this situation, too, although at the end of that conversation, he threatened to try and commit me to the psych ward again if I kept talking that way so he like. Cares.), so they'd be safe. Obviously this isn't just about helping out my friend, though. The fact I'd be more useful to him dead than alive is just a bonus.

The real reason I want to die is because being trapped in the body that everything happened to and forced to relive it is torture. I can't sleep because of it (either nightmares or some nights, every position I try to fall asleep in reminds me of a position I was abused in), can't shower or bathe regularly (same thing), can't let people touch me without proper warning, etc, etc. Every day I'm not working I feel stuck in my bed or the couch, trapped with only alcohol or drugs to bring me any peace. There's so much fear and sadness in me. I don't have a quality of life and I dread having to deal with this for another three or four decades. I deserve to end things on my terms, to be able to end my misery. The first time I tried to kill myself I was five years old, so I think that's long enough to know what I want, to know I have no hope of getting better. Some of us (DID alters) are so scared of dying, especially of the methods I've picked (they're painful and gruesome, but if I combine methods, I'll up my chances of success. I can't afford to fail if I do this) but most of us are more scared of staying alive to suffer."
"Story of my life is that im just a used cunt. Was raped as kid when a man close to my family decided to fuck me. Basically he just would tell people he was taking me places, but then get mad at me for random shit and fuck me. Things he punished me with rape for: getting sunburned, wandering off, letting my swimsuit top slip down, walking too slow, growing boobs, not finishing my food, not calling my mom to tell her where i was, not speaking to him in English, rejecting his kiss. He also would hold me down and let his friends have me. He rubbed oil on my nipples and took pictures of me splayed out. I remember him and his friend laughing together about how wet I was, saying that I liked it, and taking pictures of me to prove how much i liked it. When I started growing boobs he pinched them painfully and said I was a slut, and then laughed that my nipples got hard. I remember him sitting on my chest and forcing me to take his dick in my mouth. He also drugged me once and had me like that. He took pictures and videos of my body. 

As a teen I had relationships with older men where I would get emotional support from them and help and in exchange send them nudes and basically be their camgirl. I was so depressed at this time and would slash open my own vagina afterwards to punish myself. 

As an adult Ive been raped twice. One was so violent. He chocked me and beat me up and I got brain damage that I still struggle with.  Basically im a stupid fuck doll now too. 

The other rape was just some horny asshole. It still fucked me up though. Ive tried to kill myself a few times, but im too weak to go through with it. 

These rapes are the defining feature of my life. Im just a stupid used up cunt who deserves to die. I hate the sounds I made while being raped. I still remember listening to myself. I could not control myself and sometimes made little whimpers and squeeles when something hurt too much and i felt like my insides were ripping open. My rapist laughed at the sounds and said i liked it. I'm nothing. 

I won't make it through. Im not even pretty enough to be raped but it still happened. I deserve death. My mind and body is broken. I won't survive. 

I just want warmth."
Atleast once or twice a week I have a day where I can not stop thinking about it. Is this normal?
"I really want ur judgement pls 💔

"I’m tired of all the “accept yourself the way you are”. If you can do that, good for you. I also accept other autistic people for who they are. But I hate myself.

I hate having a fried brain every day from overstimulation, I hate not being able to talk to anyone without tension and confusion, I hate not getting accommodation at school. I hate being alone.

I’ve always been a burden and I’m crying in bed just wishing I could end it. I started cutting last month and it’s the only thing that’s been keeping me alive. I just wish I knew how to be worth something :("
"I just came back from a 4 month long psychosis episode that convinced me I'm God and the universe is in my imagination. I've been unemployed the entire time because if you're God who needs a job? I'm about to be evicted from my apartment and my poor cats are going to be put down. The absolute worst part of all of this is I had a great job. My psychosis convinced me to quit because the ""universe"" had a plan for me. I had no idea I lost my mind everything made perfect sense to me. I want to die and I wish I was never born at all. I can't live without my cats and I won't. That's all thanks for reading."
"I just lost my job, and the next day my wife of 4.5 years announces she wants a divorce.  Won't even consider couple counseling.   Have a step daughter I love like my own.  I can't start over.

"Tried to kill myself. Survived but was advised to go to ER in case of any injury. Stupidly, I was honest about what happened.

All tests came back normal. Now I’m stuck here waiting for a psychiatrist to “evaluate” me. There isn’t shit they’re going to do. I’m not going to in patient or out patient. I can’t afford it anyway. And I’m not going to try to kill myself again. 

Why can’t I leave?

UPDATE: Just got out . I needed it. I feel better now"
I knew I shouldn't have done it. I knew that I had someone who cares about me. This is my 3rd attempt. It happened three days ago. I was just trying to reach my parents but they kept ignoring me. I was so upset and hopeless. I just wanted a family. I wanted my parents to forgive me. They didn't even visit me at the hospital. My girlfriend has stayed with me during the whole process. She is so sad. And I regret it. I feel terrible. I wish I could undo it. Today I am home. My girlfriend didn't go to work. She doesn't wanna leave me alone at home. I accepted that my parents don't love me nor care about me. But somehow I feel happy that I survived. I don't even know why.

"I’ve hurt many people in my life. I’ve lied, manipulated, destroyed lives. 
I just received a message from one of my exes, in which he called me many names, which I absolutely understand. At the end, he simply told me to kill myself. As did many people in my life.
I’m a monster. I deserve to die. I’m just looking for a way out. It doesn’t have to be easy, I want it to hurt. I deserve all the hurt. My heart can’t function normally anymore and it doesn’t deserve to.
Piece of shit like me doesn’t deserve to live. "
I’m so embarrassed all the time. I’ve had enough. I want to die. I can’t talk to people anymore. It’s awful. I feel so embarrassed and suicidal. I went out with my best friends today and I’m scared they hate me. I’m so annoying. I get anxious I talk to much. I want to die. I genuinely hate myself. I accidentally said something that came off as flirty to one of my friends and now I’m embarrassed because I don’t have a crush on her and I’m straight anyway. Talked about subjects that weren’t fun. I’m awful. I just want to die. I hate myself. I want to disappear. I wanna hang myself. I’m very seriously considering it right now. I had an anxiety attack this morning so cut myself had a bandage on my arm because it was still bleeding when my friend arrived. So I was wearing my coat the whole time because I was scared they’d see.
"I hate everything about myself. My body makes me want to kill myself, and no one understands. I want to claw my way out of this body.

I get physically sick looking at myself in the mirror. I am alone, and no one cares to even ask how I'm doing. What's the point of Im stuck in this body?

Living like this is torture."
"warning, this may be dysphoria inducing. read at your own risk.

everytime i look at myself i feel physically ill to the point where i nearly throw up. nothing about me is right and it never will be right. no amount of surgeries and transitioning is gonna fix this. for example, one thing i cant ever experience is a boy childhood. i feel robbed, i feel wrong, and i feel disgusting. i just want to wake up from this awful nightmare… i feel like im in the lowest level of hell. boy i sure hope that reincarnation is real, maybe if i kill myself i can come back as a real man! maybe then i can finally be happy, you know the only reason i feel like this is because of my sex. if i was born male i would have the perfect life. i’d have no depression, no anxiety, no insecurities and no suicidal thoughts. i say that with confidence, the only reason i have all of all this mental shit is because im transgender. i barely leave the fucking house because of extreme dysphoria. hell i cant even be happy during the summer because of this bullshit. i wish i could go swimming, i wish i could go to the beach, i wish i could go outside in 30°C+ weather without wearing sweaters and baggy pants. the main reason i love winter so much is because i wont pass out from heatstroke damn it!

if there is a god above, he is one sick and twisted individual."
"I’m finding it really hard to make plans because I already know I’m gonna kill myself around new years, definitely by January. I don’t want to agree to trips, concerts, ongoing commitments or anything because it’ll just make the experience more painful for everyone, but I have a hard time explaining every time why I can’t do something months in advance when I’m obviously free. I just wish no one loved me so this process was easier for everyone."
"I am tired of everything. I am tired of posting here. I am tired of bring lonely. I am tired of being useless.

Feel free to ignore me, everyone else does. It’s not like anyone has any advice that actually works. When someone has problem with finances, people can solve the problem. My problem isn’t solvable by throwing money at it, unless someone has millions to throw at it. So naturally, all I get is some bullshit advice to keep holding or keep trying as if that has changed anything."
I spent all night laying on the train tracks so I could finally fucking die and leave this shitty world once and for all. But the fucking train never came and now I’m still stuck here in this hell. For a moment I was actually fucking happy that it was about to finally all be over and instead I’m still alive and I absolutely hate being alive. I still plan to end my worthless fucking life and it’s only a matter of when I choose to
"Goodbye

 I lost my battle with life. I CANT DO THIS ANYMORE. EVERYDAY I WAKE UP AND I HATE THE FACT THAT I DID. EVERYDAY IS WORK. EBVERYDAY IS PARENTING. EVERY FUCKING DAY IS RESPONSIBILITY AND STRESS.

"seriously, i'm supposed to 'stay alive' for people who will apparently be sad if i die, but like none of them are even??? bothering??? to talk to me???? when i'm actually here???? even in online groups no one fucking interacts with me or they're gone for months on end.

on top of that, the only thing keeping me here is my book and i'm reading it through and it's shit and no one will read it or publish it anyway, so who gives a fuck, right??

why do i have to stay for things and people that are so clearly not worthwhile? i literally don't have anyone. the only person i had is dead.

  
edit: hey y'all, i'm actually in another country rn so i'll get back to everyone when i can pahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
"Why was I born like this? Why are my shoulders so narrow as a guy? This is surely the worst thing a guy can posses, and I have it. Nothing is worth it anymore. No amount of muscle will fix my narrow frame. Just as if I am some human garbage that should have been disposed of a long time ago. The only thing that is worrying me is my thin ass rope that will most likely break when I attempt. I am worth nothing"
"I’ve thought about suicide for a long time now. Been suicidal for several years. I don’t know if there was a day in the last two years that I haven’t thought about suicide. The weird thing is, that when I first started getting badly suicidal, I was scared of it. I was afraid, I would hyperventilate thinking about it. I wanted to escape it. But over the time thoughts about suicide have started to actually calm me down, cause when Life is so bad it only makes sense. It’s the finale escape from all this suffering. I know now that I’m broken. I think my mind is lying to me when it tells me to hold onto hope and frankly so many people have died before me and will after me, so it’s not as scary as it seemed to be at first. 

When I fall asleep at night I think about killing myself, cause I’m starting to look forward to it. I wish life was different. I wish I never made the mistakes I made. I wish I could be happy and enjoy life, I wish life wasn’t so unfair but sadly I’m depressed, I made the mistakes I made, I can’t enjoy life and life is unfair and I also don’t think I can change my way of thinking. I think I’m broken, so suicide means freeing myself of this pain once and for all. 

I used to be so afraid of how my family would react to my death and I’m still scared that they will think I’m selfish for it but with time I really am starting to realise that it will be the best for them! I’m such a burden to them and I think they know that, even if they don’t want to admit it, but I am. So knowing I will relieve them of this burden that is me also makes me less scared and sad about suicide. 

So when it gets too unbearable (so almost always) thinking about suicide calms me down, sometimes I can even smile thinking about it, cause it will be the end of my mental pain.

"I think I was about 8 when i first thought about suicide. I have never been the smartest, and i was really struggling in school. I never thought about it seriously though. I should have.

I'm 17 now. I am still not the best at school. I graduate in 7 days, but I can't find it in me to be excited. I feel like i have nothing ahead of me. I just don't want to live to graduate."
"We haven't known each other for long, but he was the type of friend I really connected with. In the last year I found him really annoying due to his constant lying and self pity. He was selfish and narcissistic, which led me to believe that he wouldn't kill himself. I know now that was a lie on my part.

I didn't want to deal with him and have constantly postponed having a hard talk with him. I have never regretted anything as much as I regret this.

I saw him a couple of days before, and we talked candidly and openly about a lot of personal thoughts. It was a good talk but I wasn't as good of a listener. I lacked empathy and understanding. If I wasn't so full of myself, I could have gotten him to open up more, we could have gone through all his troubles. I'm convinced that if I did that he would be alive today.

I know he was planning this for a long time, the issues he had stretched from before our friendship. But the problems weren't his issues. The problems were that he was alone. He had friends and family but no one he could open up to, no one who could understand him. I could have, I just didn't bother.

He was a better friend to me than I was to him. He was a very empathetic person, and I will miss him a lot. The worst part is it took him dying for me to realize this. I know that if he told me that he was considering this, I would have said everything I should have. But it shouldn't have been his responsibility. I love him and I miss him and I am so sorry."
"I've had a horrible sexual experience tonight. 27 years old male, I've been feeling down recently and have been using multiple bad habits to cope which I know has a negative effect on me. I made the bad decision to meet up with another guy tonight. I drove to a place where I know local gay men go. This is a wooded area not far from a main road. I met a guy there who asked if I wanted to do something sexual. I said yes and we started. Halfway through I started to get bad vibes off him he was getting rougher and more aggressive. I wanted to say to stop but couldn't get the words out. I pushed him away but not aggressively. He carried on doing what he was doing until it was finished. Since then I've been feeling discussed. Angry at putting myself in that place to begin with and angry that I couldn't get my words out. The only way to get my mind to shut up was to smoke some weed and now I feel worse."
"“__ happened, im literally gonna kill myself lol” Shut up. If you were suicidal in the past or now, I’d let it slide, you’re just coping and stuff. 

But it annoys me so much when people who’ve never had a struggle in their lives, especially when it comes to that side of mental health, say they’ll kill themselves over small things. They don’t understand how it feels. Now whenever I seriously mean “I’m gonna kill myself” they all think I’m joking, that I’m exaggerating. I’m not. All my friends say it and they don’t mean it. But I do. They don’t understand at allsnsisjnsjnwankswnj"
"Hello, how are you?

"im 16 and im already made out to be a failure by adults because i dont have a job, have no hobbies and dont know what to do in the future. on top of that i have to deal with other stressful adolescent things like my crippling body dysmorphia, lack of friend and overall just extreme loneliness. i continue to waste my limited time by daydreaming of the life i could’ve had as a way to cope with my current situation. how the hell do so many people make it past adulthood under so much pressure??"
"I'll fuckin' kill you, nevermind myself, if you say that again.

I feel guilty saying that, cause people say that with the best intentions, but this is the attitude of a 35 year old male who's identified their traumas, taken action, forgiven the people who wronged him, completed CBT, psychotherapy, went on a journey of self discovery and healing only to end up feeling worse than ever before! 

How can I possibly have any hope things will get better? I spent years believing it would. It didn't. It hasn't. 

And now my youth is gone. A whole new world of depression. At least being young, you're young and depressed. Trying being middle aged and depressed. And god love the old and depressed. 

I think most people in this sub want someone to relate to. Not generic advice. Again, they say so with the best intentions, but after so many years of hearing it, the repetition becomes iritating. 

I realise I sound like an ungrateful cunt. 

Thats one of my curses. Being painfully aware of my shortcomings and feeling powerless to change them, despite many efforts. 

I forget the point of all this shit. 

Best of luck to everyone unfortunate enough to find themselves in this sub. 

Fuck it all."

"I am 33.

I have failed everything, even though I tried. 

For the rest of my life, I will be poor.

For the rest of my life, I will be working at a job I hate.

For the rest of my life, I will be frustrated and regretful.

For the rest of my life, I will be mostly lonely.

For the rest of my life, I won't have a reason to wake up in the morning.

So basically the choice is between ending it now and waiting 20 or however many years of pain.

Can anyone give me any reason why I shouldn't do it? Because I don't have any. I am tired of the dumb generic platitudes about how life is wOrTh LiViNg and the BS ""you never know what's gunna happen!!"". I need real actual reasons."

"I’m hurting so much and I just want it to stop. 

I decided to prep the suicide letters just to find something to keep me going for a while but I realised that I had no love or life. No one to say goodbye to. Nothing to leave behind. 

What’s the point of staying alive if there’s nobody and nothing to live for. I know the cliche of “living for yourself” but I bet those people had at least one person who loved them. I have nothing at all and it hurts so much. There’s no end to the pain. I just want it to stop hurting. Just for a little while. 

Please can someone see this. Can someone please hear me. I’ll even pay money to have a friend right now. "

I was raped at 8 years old. It’s been almost half of my life now that I’ve been traumatised. I’ve been suicidal since 11 years old. I’ve done all the things you’re supposed to do when you have trauma or are suicidal. Some things are just meant to be. And I think suicide for me is the best option. The only option really if I’m being honest. I’m going to just end up a drug addict who’s homeless and has no friends or family when I’m older. So tonight I’m gonna do it. I will first subtly make sure my friends and family know I love them first. Then tonight when everyone is sleeping I will finally not have to be traumatised anymore."

"I'm 13 and I have wanted to kill myself for a year. I am just so miserable and unhappy. I struggle everyday and as a kid nobody cares for me. Whenever I tell my parents about it they like joke around with it or completely ignore it. I have no friends and no social life, I am alone all the time. I have siblings but they hate me. My sister told me she wished I would've died the first time I tried to kill myself and my mom got mad at me once and told me she wish I would've been successful with my suicide so that she could stay with her ""good kids"" I have no reason to be on this planet anymore, everybody hates me and I'm all alone.

I have a box of extra strength Benadryl, which is 24 tablets of 50 mg each. I’m hoping that will take care of it. Gonna drive my car somewhere, park, and handle business.

"You gotta be desperate enough to know that you have a tiny chance of passing and still do it. You'll probably end up even worse, brain damaged, organs compromised for life. These thoughts make me so mad. The world is overpopulated anyways, some of us are suffering inhumane amounts of pain and just want to leave with some dignity. I already know what life feels like and I just want to get out. 

Nobody will hurt if I leave, in fact their lifes will be better, I'm sure. Every decision I make turns out to be wrong, I can't do what I'm told, and the fact that they thought so highly of me growing up hurts even more. I mean, if everybody saw no future in me, it would've been easier. I was my family's only hope of getting out of poverty, I was supposed to make their dreams come true, I wanted that. But how could they know? I was such a wonderful kid for them. But I was awful since I can remember. It got worse after high school, I lost everyone that cared about me in the way, and I don't blame them. Lost years to mental illness and made my most loved ones' life hell. Now I'm almost 25, about to get fired from a job I get paid 1/4 of the minimum wage, no friends left. Never had a relationship, at least. That's way to sadistic even for myself. Last time I tried was in January. Took a lot of pills and now my liver's fucked up. Nothing. I bought new resources but my mom must've found them. Of course I'll not talk to her. She deserved a better daughter. She has a good heart. Her life would be 100% better without me here. I just want to end it this week. I don't want to turn 25. I don't want to have another birthday, to be reminded that I lived another year being a failure."

"I am 16m and my life is over. I weigh 210 lbs at 5'10 and have never even been close to a relationship. Every day I think about killing myself. I daydream about the release when I pull the trigger and can finally die. I tried to kill myself in the 9th grade by taking a fist-full of every pill in my cabinet. No one other than my brother knows I am suicidal and no one ever will. Today I set my classes for senior year and realized I'm not smart enough to take college classes with my friends. Now in stuck taking random classes to graduate. I always imagined senior year to be the year Im happy. But now I realize all the time i spent rotting In my room has caught up to me. I have no life achievements, I have accomplished nothing of note. I can see the way my life ends, working a 9-5 until I kill myself. I look around and see everyone having life better than me but still being happy and I'm envious, or when I see someone get pampered and cared for when Im hurting so much more just 50 ft away."
"I'm a 22 year-old male and I went to a gun range for the first time today. I purchased a glock 19 pistol because I liked the way it felt in my hands. I was really worried that my mental health history would prevent me from buying a firearm, but it was surprisingly very easy. I also purchased some 9mm hollow point defense rounds. The person at the range said the hollow points are better for self defense compared to the target range rounds. My first suicide attempt happened about 4 years ago. I tried to overdose on a mixture of prescription and OTC medicine. If I ever wanted to attempt another suicide, I've always wanted to make sure I would succeed. I've always been very angry that I woke up the next day instead of dying. After my suicide attempt, I decided to enroll in college and get a degree in computer science. I did an engineering internship last summer and I completely hated it there. It pretty much confirmed that working a job wouldn't make life better. I've always tried giving myself a chance at life by trying new things. The problem is that mentality has been keeping me alive for way too long. I really hate the fact I couldn't just die 4 years ago. It's pathetic that I wasn't even able to kill myself. I constantly dream about dying in a car crash or some easy death to instantly kill me. By purchasing this firearm, it gives me hope there is a way out.

Edit: I’m not going to kill myself there’s still a lot to do in life. The gun is just here to give me comfort. I just need to vent about why I bought the gun. What I’m trying to say is the gun is keeping me going for some reason. The idea of having an easy way out gives me a reason to keep on living.

Edit 2: To the person who deleted their comment saying, “Don’t go kill anybody…”, you’re pretty fucking retarded if you think I would just go kill some random person just because I’m depressed and own a weapon. Maybe I’m not the one who needs to get their mental health shit together? Seeing comments like this remind me how fucking stupid people are. This is the reason why people look down on suicide when in reality we just want the pain to end for ourselves. There’s no god damn reason I would want someone to die with me I’m not a fucking psychopath. "

"I'm 43 years old. I own a vape shop in Canada. I can't afford to stay in business anymore. 51% of my costs is tax. October 1st the government is raising it to 102%. After I pay my taxes for last year I wo.t have anything left. I don't have enough to restock my store which I've been selling stuff heavily discounted before October first because anything that doesn't have the newest tax stamp can be siezed and I can be heavily fined.

She has locked another girl in her classroom in the closet and wouldn't let her out and she spies on children in the bathroom. Her grandmother treats her like she's a angel that can do nothing wrong which makes her act even worse.

"I'm realizing I wish I could delete my past and forgive me for all my flaws, for all my mistakes, for all the things that went wrong, for all the things that didn't came out as expected, for all the things I never became, for all the opportunities I lost, for all things I didn't experience, for all the disappointments I brought to my family. 

I can't go on due to the heavy weight of my past. It's hard to expect a brighter tomorrow because I can't stop thinking about my darkness. I just want to let it go. I just want to watch it burn and fade away. I just want to forget everything. I just want to hit my head and wake up with a clean mind.

I just want to be born again.

I am not my depression. I don't want to be defined by my mood swings, low self-esteem or lack of confidence. I don't want to be remembered for what I never was. I just wanna forget all the time I wasted, and start over without thinking of what went wrong.

How can I forgive myself, when I only think of dying?"
"I have been bullied all my life. people beat me for the way I dressed and the way I acted. I've been raped by two men after they drugged me. i have tried therapy, I have tried medications, none of it works. I'm sick and tired of people telling me ""life gets better"" or ""you have so much potential."" I'm done. i cant do this anymore and I want to be gone. i wish I wasn't born at all. i was born a boy and I hate it. i wish I was a girl so badly. i just cant do this anymore. life is too hard and I hate that ill never be able to live my life as a girl.

i hope others out there are able to get the help they need and are able to work through their problems and get the help they need. i am weak. i am not strong enough for this world.

i wish I loved myself.

goodbye. &lt;/3

update: everything is getting cold. My hands are shaky and I feel weird. The night sky is pretty tonight. So many stars are out. I love the fall weather here in Ohio. I am so excited to drift away and walk among the stars. I love all of you and I wish I was myself In this world, so I could live a long happu life. If there is a second life, I  see all of you there someday. You will all see me, the real me. I love all of you. Goodbye."
"I've never felt so fucking disgusting, worthless, pathetic and like a complete freak to society. I feel so fucking shitty and I just need someone to hold me tightly and cuddle with me and say everything's going to be alright. It feels like absolute shit and I feel so fucking dumb and gullible."
"I (f21) tried posting about this on a sexual assault subreddit and multiple men messaged me telling me all the reasons they didn’t believe me or how they did not feel bad for me because I am not yet in a position to move away so whatever. He keeps confessing other bad things he did to me when I’m just trying to avoid being around him. I have dead family members and the longer I carry this burden, the more I yearn to be with them. Especially my baby. I’ve never felt this way before. I can not handle this.

To my puppy LouLee, I’m so sorry. I hope your life is full of smiles and kisses going forward and that you are so so loved. I would never leave you without someone to hold and love you the way I did. I love you so so much and we will be together again one day, I am so so sorry. I can not do this anymore.
To the animals in shelters that I failed in my inability to save myself, I am truly so sorry to you too."
"On July 7th my friend drove to Rock Spring and hung herself in a motel room, alone. Her last call to her fiancé she talked about how afraid she was to kill herself- all the while no one went to find her. She drove just above 2 hours outside of her hometown to go to Rock Springs of all places. No one went to find her. I just can’t help but think about how alone she must’ve felt. How she went to a place no one would like so she didn’t ruin a town for anyone she loved. How just days prior she wrote a beautiful poem about climbing a rope to heaven to finally see god. Yet no one helped her, no one went to find her. I didn’t know she was struggling. I drove 12 hours to her funeral and the whole time I thought I drove 12 why couldn’t I have known and driven 14 just to go help her. She was so beautiful and so full of life and laughter yet she had demons. She never talked about them but they had followed her from a young age and they got her in the end. I just can’t help but be angry. No one went to find her, her funeral was so rushed, her dad didn’t seem to care. Only saying that she was finally home. When she could never be pinned down. Why would she be happy stuck in one place? Please reach out to loved ones if you’re struggling if only to talk. They are there and they do care. People just get so wrapped up in their own lives and carried away in their own current of time to remember to get out and look around every once in a while. "
"When I was 13 years old I did something very wrong. Back in the day in my middle school was fucked up trend: slaping girl's asses. I didn't have the courage to do it myself so when we had family reunion I decided to practice with my 5 years old cousin. When I was playing with her I slightly spanked her butt over the clothes multiple times. Then I continued with slightly pulling her pants down and then I slightly spanked. Once I had pulled so much that I saw her private parts and in that moment I had realized that I messed up. Since then I have never repeated such disgusting behaviour, yet my guilt and selfhate for this action has been slowly increasing. "
"I just took around 112,500 mg of acetaminophen or 225 extra strength tylenol and wanted to get to people before it all ends, this probebly doesnt make sense though since around 20 of them have probebly kicked in by now so im delerious. I wish people were better. I told my crush i liked him today since ivr been planning this for a while, i hope he doesnt think i died becuase he didnt respond to my confession, im pretty sad im never going to get a response though. Im really scared kf whatd going to happen when i die wich im asuuming will happen since im already supwr shaky and my hearts racing and my stomache is cramping like hell from the tylenol i took earlier while waiting for my parents to get home im really warm like i feel like im burning. But what if being dead is worse, i cant really go back now since 20 of tjose would be more then enough to ruin my lufe not to mention the fact i took 225 so im deffinietly going to deal with the consequences of my actions. Im not really sure why i did this most people have a reason for wanting to diei just stoppind wanting to live i wasnt really sad i just feel nothing. Even now im not really sad, my science clasd is having a feild trip tommarow im dissapointed im going to miss that. I really feel like throwing up. I think im sad i wont see anyone again but also i dont even know that i might see them. Anyway if i dont ever update agaun but if im not dead i probay still cant update since ill be in a hospital."
I know my problems make me come off as a whiny bitch. And yeah they're probably nothing serious and I'm just weak. But they feel real to me. My friends are probably sick of my shit by now and I don't blame them. But I really am in pain. I wish I had the strength to kill myself to show people that I really was in pain.
"Won’t people be equally sad if I die of natty circumstances as they would if I died consensually? I have a mood disorder that makes me want to kill myself every fucking day no matter where I am or who I’m with. I’m just living so people aren’t sad, but they will be sad later down the road anyway so why not speed run this shit"
"I don’t want to work for the majority of my life. I give up at the first sign of struggle. I'm too socially awkward and unattractive to make friends or find a partner. my genetics are shit, I am a shit person, and I'm in physical/mental distress and I just can't seem to accomplish anything. so why, why can't I kill myself, why do I have to live a meaningless life so that my family doesn't have to deal with temporary grief.

I love them and I feel so much guilt, but it's just not fair. I want an easy way out of this without being told some hopeless nonsense that things will get better."
"I take the train to work and I'm just chilling and scrolling through my phone. Then all of a sudden a huge group of people traveling together (it was like 20 people) all come in and start conversing with each other and having a good time talking about their interests, Days, and future plans.

Meanwhile I'm here. All by myself. No friends. Nothing going well in life. Nothing worth living for. I'm about tempted to just jump on the train tracks and electrocute myself to death (I'm at the train station as of me typing this) because this world isn't meant for losers like me who struggle so much to make friends and overall be successful"
"Today i got a message from a friend who went to check on my ex boyfriend because he's been struggling with shit, he overdosed and he's gone. even after the breakup he was my best friend and his crazy antics always put a smile on my face no matter how depressed i may be, and he passively kept me from killing myself just by always being there for me. it seems the last thing he did was draw a self portrait and i'm sitting here looking at a pic i was sent of the sketch he was a gorgeous guy in more ways than one. Right now i want to die just so i can be around him again idk i think if we lived we would have gotten back together sometime and lived but now an integral reason i'm alive is gone"
"I know this is a suicide watch subreddit, but it’s the only thread about suicide. Hearing all of the reasons everyone has as to why I shouldn’t, like they have a better grasp on my life than I do. I’m not poor. I’m not single or lonely. I have a decent job. 2 kids. Parents that love me dearly. None of it is enough. Drugs don’t help, doing nothing doesn’t help. Trying to talk doesn’t help. It actually makes things worse for me. I go to sleep around 8 every night just to make the day end faster. I wake up and all I want to do is die. It’s all I think about. I’m obsessed with death. I’ll be 31 on Friday, and I’ve been hoping something will take me out so I don’t have to do it myself, and so that I could have my end goal of not existing without my parents having the added guilt and 2nd guessing if I had killed myself. I’ve felt this way for probably 75-85% of the time since I was 14. I have 0 friends because I don’t want any. I don’t want to do anything ever. I don’t want to leave my house. I don’t want to watch tv. If I sit here and just do nothing, the urge to kill myself is unbearably strong. But distractions aren’t effective, and even if they are, it’s for a short period of time and it always ends, leaving me more down than before I tried to distract myself. I’ve tried talking to my family a handful of times, and the answer is either “Just trust in God, son” or “hang in there”. Like what the actual fuck. That’s the best you can do? All attempts were pathetic on their part, despite loving me so much and being so super Christian. So I just put on an act when I’m around them. Fake conversation, fake laughs and smiles, fake contentment. I do the same thing at work, and I do the same thing at home as to not worry or upset my wife and kids. I’m just so tired and everyone saying “don’t do it you have so much to live for” is just nauseating. "
"Today is my birthday. It’s been a year and a month post attempt. Year 27 was the loneliest, most isolating, self hating, anxiety ridden age. I always had a feeling I’d die young. I learned about the 27 club when Mac Miller died, and convinced myself I wouldn’t make it past 27. So how crazy that the year I turned 27, something happened to where my anxiety flared up. I’d heard of anxiety attacks but never experienced one. It formed bc I genuinely thought every single person on this planet hated me. I fucked up and it truly felt like I needed to go. While on my grippy sock vacation, I realized that I didn’t actually want to die…. I was just embarrassed and no hole was deep enough to crawl into. Today is my birthday and I’m 28. The universe is funny bc people that I haven’t spoken to in years wished me a Happy Birthday today. The universe is funny bc how is it that 6 old friends all decided to reach out on the same day (my birthday) a year and a month after I convinced myself that I wasn’t loved. "
"i graduated highschool, i have no dreams or ambitions. my family is mostly decent but my brother is an absolute piece of shit and my aunt is way too overbearing. i neglect my hygiene, i feel mentally drained and demotivated 24/7 and not even my hobbies are helping me as much anymore. i seriously just want to end it but i've always been too scared to actually do it out of the fear it might be too painful or too unbearable. my ideal way of killing myself has always been jumping off, but my parents installed nets on the balcony. now i started hurting myself (tho hurting might be an overstatement cuz all i do is scrape myself with school scissors) and i just want to get enough courage to try and slit my wrists. why cant i just make it bleed. why cant i just do it. its not like anyone will miss me anyway"
"i tried to hang myself with a belt last night but it was too short. i’m now looking at different ways i can od but i’m so scared of the pain that comes with it. i have hundreds on ibuprofen tablets, a few percocets, atarax, and lexapro on hand. not sure if just taking everything all together will get the job done quicker or just carry out the pain longer. not to mention i dreamt of shooting myself all night long. woke up only shaking from anxiety. i’m so tired of these thoughts and this pain. i don’t want to feel it anymore. i don’t. id do anything not to feel this anymore. i cant even smoke weed anymore because i’ve been so anxious and paranoid. even thinking of getting a real rope and heading down to a local bridge above the highway. my mind is already made up, i just don’t want to be in pain."
"I have no friends, no family who cares.  I don't know why I'm still here. I don't want to be here. "
"Not to mention the ageing body, sickness and suffering. Is no one mad at all that the real joke is they didn't ask to be born? "
"Yes, I am determined about this decision. You might even ask me, why not stop drinking water all together and shorten the suffering? Well, answering this question: I would like to notice my body shrinking and becoming weak. I have a certain affection for thinness. I like being thin. I want to enjoy a few moments of being thin, before I die. I've always wanted to be skinny my whole life, so... I think it would be cool.

But in truth, I don't know if I will really die. I'll probably end up in the hospital and be fed IVs. Still, it's better than continuing this pathetic existence. Being looked after by nurses, receiving attention, concern, is still better than staying at home and doing nothing all day. I don't have the strength to continue. Whatever the outcome is, I will be grateful.

I wrote a suicide note on my Instagram and I have no intention of changing my mind about my goal.

Thank you all."
"I've had enough of allthis bullshit. but if I'll kill myself, I'll be seen as ungrateful, selfish, all that shit... and in case i fail, everyone's gonna hate me. it will be even fucking worse than now. 

i just want to fucking die. i wish like a car would hit me, or a train. some accident, so noone will hate me. i just want this shit to be fucking over"
"For some reason Reddit took it down so here it is again 

I'm 21 m and I'm pathetic im ugly and I'm just straight up weird and I ain't got no life no friends no job the hobbies that brought me happiness once do not anymore my only friend is a damn bird and I can't stop thinking about sex it has driven me to the point where I sold all my stuff to try to pay for sex and when I couldn't find a prostitute or escort to pay i started cutting myself again and drinking unhealthy amount of alcohol to try to drown out the thought of Sex and the extreme loneliness I feel and don’t know what do anymore I’ve tried therapy, counseling, and the meds nothing helps 

UPDATE: since I’ve posted this nothing has gotten better I’ve since bought a gun which I plan on using it tonight and given away my best friend which hurt a lot that’s it bye "

"Just about 26 and not a single person has ever been interested in me. Nothing is going to change me either. I’ve tried so many different therapists and meds that Ive lost count. Nothing helps. So, I’m done. I’m going to hang myself tonight. It’ll probably be weeks before anyone even finds out."
"There’s no way this is real. I feel like I’m living in a simulation. not saying I want to live in a perfect world but It’s like people are constantly trying to work against each other. I sick of these this race vs that race, man vs women, people always trying to have a struggle contest and it’s strange how kids that were just brought into this crazy world are always doing something wrong to the parents but the parents are never doing anything wrong..weird almost like people are more focused on being right than actually teaching and kids are the easiest to be right against. I wish I could explain my thoughts better than this but talking has never been something I was good at. I’m sick of this world and it’s BS"

"I have tried to kill myself multiple times. Been suicidal since I was 7. I have bipolar disorder 2, and I know getting medication is gonna be someone’s response. I have been medicated for 7 years and I got back to college lost my mind and got on pills again then rediagnosed with mood disorder to bipolar 2. i stopped taking pills after 3 months and was fine, and then I just dealt. The last time I attempted I tried to hang myself and couldn’t. Tried dying from slicing my wrists and bleed out but it didn’t work. I have work in the morning and I just literally have completely lost it. I have nothing to keep me here. I won’t qualify for assisted suicide in Canada because the bill hasn’t been passed yet and because there I don’t have treatment. I was raped, in over 15k in debt, have no place to live after the semester is over, my animal is sick, I am sick, I have to get surgery soon, I have too much stress, failing college, have absolutely no money, have no energy, and just literally no room to live. I cannot end up in a psych ward because then I would just want to kill myself even more. Which is why I never told my therapist. I don’t believe in therapy because my therapist abandoned me after 7 years because I was “too much”, fully knowing I have abandonment issues. Sometimes I wish my abusive ex literally just killed me, because he still haunts me to this day trauma bond is real. I have had a gun to my head so many times by him. I just literally do not want to live. I just wanna close my eyes, go to sleep and never wake up. I can’t though, because each time I attempt I fail. I have too much going on, my mind is against my body and vise versa. Last time I tried to overdosed nothing happened I just ended up with liver damage. I can’t legally own a gun because 1 I have my med card and 2 I am mentally ill. I try so hard to smile through the pain and go through life. I look at these news reports of people who kill themselves, and just go wow. I wish that were me. I wish I was successful. I am trying to strangle myself but I know it is stupid because my natural instinct will take over like the time I tried to hang myself. I have friends, but in reality I really don’t have anyone. I have my biological family and adoptive family to try to balance and its just annoying. I pray everyday I get hit with a car, get into a bad accident I just die. i physically cannot kill myself because if I fail I will be a vegetable or literally end up brain dead and then stuck living a worse life. accepting this life isn't an option. i wish there was a button I could press to self destruct. i am just done. why is it so hard to kill myself. my purpose has already achieved, nothong worth living for.

"I've lost everything. My entire career. My identity. My boyfriend of 6 years. The girl I fell in love with. My community. My ambition and drive. My cognitive abilities. My wonderful apartment. The city I adored.

And the pain is so large that I can't feel anything else. All the things in life that brought me joy, small or large, I'm totally numb to.

I want to be dead so bad. I don't want to keep going with the pain of what I lost, the dumb mistakes I made that led here. I don't know how to fill a day so I just stay in bed or cry. And it's impossible to imagine a future where things are better or ok, because I feel so irreversibly broken.

I've been heartbroken before. I've lost friends before. I've dealt with depression and pain before. But it was never anything like this.

I have a method but I'm too scared. But I don't know how to keep going."
"I have nothing and no one. If i had access to a gun id shoot myself instantly. but no one cares. I feel like no one even cares one bit. im so ugly and odd looking, i have an ugly smile, im not tall enough for anyone , my body is built weird i have an ugly voice and an ugly laugh. im awkward and shy too. im just no where near good enough for anyone. I have no skills or anything. im not good at anything. i feel completely useless. i have no friends, never had a girlfriend, never had a kiss or anything of that. no job, car license or family that cares about me. I have nothing and i am nothing."
"Still in the hospital and just gained my phone access back today and now everything else just feels... small. I feel like I fucked up really bad and that maybe the problems that led me here can actually be worked on and progress is actually possible even if in small increments. I've had nothing but time this whole month to think. I miss my dog so fucking much, I miss going outside, I miss being allowed to shower, I miss real food. I miss my favorite music. I miss taking a deep breath of night air. I've missed the stupid internet. I miss reading and writing and I miss all the hobbies I gave up in the cloud of depression. I didn't fully realize how bad I had gotten over the last year until I woke up here. Now I just miss the outside world and dialysis sucks a lot. They expect my kidneys to ""wake up"" in the course of some weeks but of course they can't tell me for certain since there's always the small probability I don't recover. I'm thankful the seizures I was having didn't give me brain damage and I'm tired of being asked every day what day it is, what year is it, where am I, who I am, who is the current president. I want to pretend this was all just a really, really bad dream. And now I just feel stupid for what I did in 5 minutes. A month in a hospital, no known discharge date, for 5 minutes of swallowing pills. I'm alive for some reason. Why don't I ever try fighting to live? Why is that never one of the options I consider? Needed to vent, been totally isolated here. Maybe I need to consider the old me dead and start as a new person. I don't know, something has to change. 

Bummer that my first helicopter ride I can't even remember it. I just want to get out of here. I want to start working on the things that are stressing me out while I sit here so I can feel like life is a lesser strain on me. Shelter, food, medicine, income, I can work on securing these things. People do it all the time. I'm not any different or anymore hopeless than they are.

When it rains, it pours, I guess. I just want some sunshine back."
I am so angry at them. They're the reason I have to get up and keep going every day. It's like torture. It feels like they're torturing me. I feel so trapped. My dad and my friends are keeping me around and I resent them so much for it.
I’m going to kill myself. Literally NO ONE will hire me. I’ve done so many interviews and applications and changed my resume so many times idk what’s wrong not even McDonald’s or dollar tree will hire me. It’s been almost two years. Not only that my anxiety is off the roof and I need to see a doctor but I can’t afford it because I got kicked out of my parents house. My relationship is going downhill. I’m not good for anything and I honestly don’t know what else to do anymore.
"In my case it has only gotten WORSE and
WORSE. Just when I thought l've reached my rock bottom, I discover that the previous one was literal child's play compared to the new low I reached. I just really don’t want to be here anymore yet even suicide seems to be out of my reach somehow "
"The last time I attempted suicide I had to stay in a ward for 2 nights. I needed 3 drips, the first one was 1 hour long, the second was 4, the third was 16. But I was in there for a good 4 hours before being treated.

One of the nurses that was treating me had been giving my dirty looks the entire time. I only had a shirt on because I needed the drip so my arms were exposed, I just assumed she was disgusted by my arms or something. In between drips the nurse would come into the bed bey I was in and take blood. 

I caused a struggle for them every time because I have a really bad fear of needles, I have never gotten any vaccinations and any needles I have gotten I've been sedated for-- (or have been a toddler) so I understand that she would be annoyed but the 2nd time I got my blood taken, another nurse was holding me still while the original nurse took my blood. This time the nurse makes a rude comment saying "" if you can cut yourself you can get your blood taken. "" 

I was really upset by this and started crying, the nurse just rolled her eyes."
"this is really the only thing i have left in my mind while waiting for the train,i just want to let it go somewhere"
"I mean...OF COURSE I don't **want** to do it. It's not like I run about the streets joyfully announcing that I'll kill myself. It's not like people undergoing chemo want to do chemo. They just see it as the better alternative and feel it's a necessary step to take.

Also, sorry for not fitting into your mental image of someone who doesn't want to live any longer. Would you please give me detailed instructions so next time I am more convincing? Do I have to get my chopped head delivered in an Amazon box right to your doorstep for you to actually listen to me and validate my feelings instead of dismissing me like I don't even really know what I'm thinking?"
"For context, I am currently 4th year in college. 

The stress of everything is getting to me from the papers I have to do to the elections (we're kinda fucked either way we look at it since the US influences my country's foreign policy). It just doesn't seem like it's worth it to live anymore. 

I have a friend who killed herself 4 years ago and I wish I were dead like her. I envy her. Dead people don't have problems. She was also very politically minded, so this election really triggered the hell out of the memories of my friend and how she would probably say ""fuck you"" to everyone who was voting for the autocrats. It brings me comfort, but also makes me angry that I can do nothing to make the world better than it is. I might as well take myself out of it and join her.  

I fucked up big time in terms of schoolwork, especially for my internship. I might not be able to get the shit I need to do done since I fucked up in printing the wrong details of a very important legal document and now I have to redo everything. I hate how my short stint of extreme happiness and distractability on my antidepressants made me not see the details that were wrong. And now that the wrong documents were signed after months of waiting, I have to have them signed again.

I'm just tired. I don't have the energy anymore. I wish I could stop my antidepressants and induce my suicidal ideation to motivate me to do it and finally succeed (even though I'm still taking them to avoid getting physically sick). I wish I could not want to go back to therapy anymore since I fucked up in implementing the coping skills my therapist taught me. Everything that I thought helped seems useless now. 

I just want to die. I want revenge on those who brought me into this world without my consent. Why should I even continue living? There's no point. "

"everything good feels just out of reach. i have friends that like me, but they don’t truly understand me. i find it incredibly difficult to be open because i’m hiding so many negative thoughts that i don’t want to put onto other people.i did everything to ensure my success before college and i’m already failing. i’m so incredibly overwhelmed by what most people would consider a normal workload. i’ve gotten tutoring, been to counseling, connected with a therapist, went to office hours, set up weekly appointments with an executive functioning tutor, etc.  i reach out for help again and again and at this point it’s all i do. it feels like i’m begging other people to give me reasons to live because i can’t do so myself. and it hurts so much because every one of them has looked right at me told me how smart i am and how much potential i have, and that i’m doing the right thing by reaching out for help. but i’m getting tired. i have so many people who want me to succeed and i feel like i’m letting them all down. i hate being autistic SO MUCH. i sit alone in my single dormitory and i feel so depressed i can barely walk. i can’t kill myself because i want so badly to live but i also can’t stand the idea of feeling this way for the rest of my life. i have dreams of becoming a professor and making a difference in people’s lives but i can barely handle my own. i’m so young, but i’ve felt this way for so long. does it ever get better "
I wish there was a place for people like us. Where we could just be ourselves in the world. With no shame. Life beat us down. We’re not unworthy because of it.

"English is not my first language sorry for possible mistakes. Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm (19f) a horrible person, this took a lot of courage to write up, my brain is foggy and I'm writing this while sobbing.

As you see from the title, I am a zoophile. I don't want this attraction, but it's the only thing that's in my head recently. My past horrible mistakes will kill me once. 

A little bit of lore 

It started in December. And it was only happening in December, I cut off everything afterwards because i realised I am a horrible person. Went into a spiral, even cut myself. I couldn't handle myself anymore. I don't really want to disclose in detail about what I did. But it was horrible and I wish I didn't do it. Though I want to say I didn't hurt an animal or anything. It's still eating me up from the inside and I can't find peace. 

There is days where I feel okay when I'm distracted by friends. But then I feel awful when I'm at home alone because all the thoughts come back. All the guilt and fear and shame comes back and I can't handle it anymore. I can't find a therapist near me that would be suitable. All of them are far away.. but I felt like I really needed to get this out of my system.

I feel like my thoughts are mostly intrusive, everything is a trigger though, I can't look at my dogs without feeling extremely guilty. I would never in my life hurt them and I don't feel an attraction towards them, I think. I can't imagine myself with an animal, I still feel an attraction to humans. All I feel is fear. I fear myself and feel like I have no control over myself. Anything I enjoyed before is gone, I can't enjoy anything anymore.. I can't focus on school. I used to be really happy up until the fact I was stupid enough to go to a man's house I didn't know well enough because I was desperate for affection. But I didn't like the way he treated me but couldn't say no and had nowhere to go so I had to sleepover at his house. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. 

I also never want to associate with the people that are sexually active with animals. I find it disgusting.

I'm sorry this is a mess. I'm so afraid of death..please don't be rough with me. I already did enough self loathing and will never be able to forgive myself. Thanks for listening. If I could also DM anyone I would be really grateful."
"There is LITERALLY nothing good about my looks at all. I have an ugly smile, ugly nose, im not built at all, awful voice, terrible laugh, my dick isnt big, no abs, im weirdly built, my back is really messed up, my waist makes me look like a girl and i can go on. I swear everything wrong that happens to me traces back to not being attractive. Like people respect me less and look down on me, its impossible to find a relationship or get any friends, im automatically socially awkward and weird too. its impossible to get anywhere in life. Not even gonna mention all the other problems i have but this one is the worst. if i had a gun id shoot myself right now and remove my face."
"everybody tells you not to kill yourself but nobody tells you what you're supposed to do instead. i take my meds, I go to therapy twice a week, I see my friends when I can. been to every ward in a 100 mile radius. i do everything in my power to improve my life and mindset because I truly do want happiness or at least neutrality but after years and years of improvement and actually seeing change, I've been stripped down to just the core of me and I've realized no matter what life I live, no matter what wishes get fulfilled, this is what I am like. i cannot be happy. i could win the lottery, I could reprogram my entire brain but the person I am is an unsatisfyable, unhappy one. any time spent continuing life will be promised unhappiness and I just don't know what I'm expected to do other than kill myself."
"I actually deserve it. my thoughts are so vile and mean and in the past I've done something that'll haunt me forever. I dont want this I dont want to think like this but every time I replace them with something positive the awful shit screams ten times louder. 

I need to be punished I need to I need some kind of closure to be reborn as something better its eating me alive. hurting myself no matter how much doesn't feel the same and I cant cut how deep I want because my parents would know. someone beat the shit out of me please with a metal pole break my legs force me to starve I hate myself please. "
"I will never gain the respect that pretty people get without even trying. I will have to slave away for it, and I hate that. I look into the mirror and cry. I don't have the features required to be considered attractive. I don't have the money for surgery. I hate myself. "
"its just crapand i will never find a thing thats good about it, jusg being in my body its a shit, this penis is shit, my hands, shoulders, neck, face, eyes, beard, feet, legs, and mostly my voice, i cant find a way out, i dont even want to go outside and thats makes me feel like shit for a bunch of reasons.

  I just rot in my room all day, watching shorts and playing GoW, worst thing is that no one notices, and i wish they did, because i atleast could feel like somebody is paying atention to me,(even tho i know i wouldn't accept help, shame, feeling like im a victim, etc) i wont forget to mention my gf, we've been together for 2 years and shes SO supportive, wich makes me feel Even more guilty, i focus more on her than i do with myself.

 I just wish so bad someone could read this and tell me something, everything its just a fucking blur and i cant feel anything but lonelines that i bring to myself, and hopelessness bc of my body, i was zoning out today and a friend just said ""depression"" and i laughed at the joke, thinking that maybe they notice, but dont care enough. I feel alone.

i wish i had the balls to kms, ironic that i have 2 of them but not for the purpose i want."

"I'm gay, everyone hates me

Hello there ,I am from a country that doesn't not tolerate ""alternative sexual orientations"" all my friends and family are homophobic..in a level that if they new about me they'll kill me themselves, am tired of pretending to be straight, am always depressed and suicidal..nobody knows about my orientation but I can't take it anymore. I planning of coming out to everyone and ending it all..I can't suffer anymore. People like me have been killed in my country with even police commiting extra judicial killing and nobody does anything...🥺🥺
The only person who knew and loved me got luck to move to Germany permanently through the rainbow rail..I couldn't let him not go"
"literally everyone i’ve ever been close with in the slightest. and my attempt failed. i’m so embarrassed that i might not even have to try to kill myself again, i’m going to have a heart attack"
"well fuck, I didn't think I'd come to this but being trans in Romania is just pure suicide from birth, honestly I fucking hate this country, y'all were worried about the government taking away trans rights in the USA? try looking at Romania. I could go on and on and on and on with how much I hate this damn country but I won't, I have everything planned the method, the location, etc. I'm just tired, way too tired to even exist anymore"
"So I don’t know what to do. 

I took a shower and suddenly that impulse to kill myself returned to me. I'm alone at home now and I hear all the fireworks and all the people enjoying themselves outside and can't stand it anymore! 

I feel so alone and I miss my father who passed away this year. I feel guilty that he stays in 2023 and I move on. I don’t know what to do. 

My face is burning and I don’t know why.

I locked myself in the room because I'm afraid of doing something stupid."
"i feel like I'm already dead. my emotions are there, but i feel like they're behind a tinted window. the work is daily. i often question the people around me.
my mind can barely stand most people. it's just living your life on autopilot. self-destruction doesn't even work anymore. more bad days than good ones. life is confused and doesn't even seem real. joy is short-lived and most often replaced by shame and regret. i love sleeping because it's the closest thing not to exist that i can do, but even it becomes impossible."
"Every day just feels the exact same, maybe I am already dead and this is my hell loop. I have become a shell of the person I used to be and I know I'm not wanted wherever I'm not needed and I'm so tired I cannot keep making myself indisposable I feel exhausted all the time I really, really really just want to die this needs to stop my head hurts constantly "
"I've spent the whole day crying off and on.
Not a single family member have gotten in touch. I haven't even received just one birthday card.
I've endured shitty birthdays in the past but I'm really struggling to survive this one.
To top it off my electric is about to run out, I can't even do anything to celebrate by myself.
I just don't want to live here anymore. I just want to disappear.
 I'm so tired of feeling like this."
I hire prostitutes &amp; escorts because I don't have any luck in my dating life and still have a desire to have sex. 
"I’m at a point where I just can’t take it anymore. Everywhere I look, I struggle to find anything good in this life or in the world. It feels like the majority of humanity is evil, and if I’m being honest with myself, I don’t think I’m an exception to that either. There’s so much wrong with the world—climate change is threatening our future, there are cold-blooded killers, wars raging in different places, and people who commit horrific acts like rape and racism. People seem incapable of accepting one another for who they are, and it’s exhausting. I don’t want to live in a world like this. It feels so overwhelmingly unfair and broken.

I’m not sure if I’m suicidal, but lately, the weight of everything is becoming unbearable. I don’t know how I’m supposed to keep going when everything feels so wrong. It’s like I’m constantly torn between two extreme options—either isolate myself completely from society, live in a small village where I only interact with a few people, or... I don’t know, maybe end it all. But right now, I feel stuck because neither option seems possible.

I’m reaching out because I’m lost. What should I do? Does anyone else feel this way? How do you manage to bear with it all? How do you keep moving forward in a world that feels so broken."

For context I am a 21 year old male and I’ve been dealing with trying to find jobs and not hearing back. I aged out of foster care and have no one to rely on. I’m moneyless and I’m about to be evicted in a week. I have no where else to go and I don’t wanna be homeless. So to anyone reading this I’m sorry and just know you have a place.

I should have took a different path but here am I.
If only I were given a chance to go back in time. Even if though it's not possible.

"Do you know cool it would be to die on a leap year? All my suffering friends wouldn’t have to worry about the one year anniversary. I’d be here February 28, but not March 1st.

I think that would be better than dying on a random day. Since it won’t happen for another 4 years. It would be so interesting and definitely add to my suicide. I think it would help. 

Edit: For everyone replying ""I want to as well"" please stop. This isn't about you. I'm tired of venting and coming to my comments and people always talk about themselves. I don't plan on helping you. I need help for me. Make you’re own post if you really want. I’m tired of feeling responsible for everyone."

i  don't know why I kept doing it i feel like shit.

I'd go back to my bed to curl up into a ball kind of having my arm over my head as if I'm giving myself a hug. I'm so sorry if this is disturbing but i just idk I'm sorry"

"I’m 28 and I feel like the world is such a cruel place. Every day feels like another unstoppable atrocity takes place and we all just have to sit here and watch while we do pointless jobs for people who don’t care about anything except keeping a business running. Living amongst this feels so pointless and almost wrong. I have issues beyond this (anxiety,depression) but being alive and watching the world play out feels like watching a car crash in slow motion and I’m so sick of it. I just want to run for away and never be seen again."
"All I gotta do is finish the pack, climb over the railing and it'll all be over. Wikipedia says the drop from this bridge is bigger than from the Golden State so it should get the job done.

Fact is I'm a worthless, useless, abusive and manipulative piece of shit. I should've never even gotten a chance to live on this planet. My existence is, without exaggeration, one of the sickest, cruelest jokes in the history of this planet.

I have nothing to life for. Nothing good has ever happened to me. I was emotionally tortured my entire childhood. I've been addicted to every drug I could get my hands on since I was 13. I've spent my entire life in poverty. I get constant PTSD nightmares and flashbacks, and in turn I violently lash out at everybody in my life. I don't go 30 minutes without trashing my apartment or screaming at somebody in a mindless rage.

Therapy is too expensive. I can't pay my bills. I have nothing in my bank account. Only thing I really own at this point is a lighter and 4 marlboro reds.

I don't want to be homeless and I don't want to hurt any more people. I have to end it all before that.

I hope someone reads this because I don't really have anyone in my life who would find and read a note"

* Brush my teeth.

"i don't want to live as a trans person, i just wish i could've been born a man. it will never matter how much surgery i get or how well i pass, i'll always be a woman. i have been born and raised as a woman, had uniquely female experiences, and have xx chromosomes. no matter what i do, i'll never be a male. i'll be miserable forever.
this is such a cruel joke. why was i born as a sex that i would never feel comfortable as? i don't want to be alive in this body."
"This is going to be long, and odd. I will call him my boyfriend, but we hadn't made it official due to my reservations and wanting to take things slow. 

I met my boyfriend at the behavioral hospital a few months ago. We both connected by our divorces that we had a similar situation in, both from our spouses sleeping around. 

It started from us just relating to one another, to staying connected afterwards, and before we knew it we were seeing each other every day. 

He was a self harmer and I had tried to commit suicide.  

I am not a self harmer, I've only had two attempts at suicide and it was after my divorce and after I had been sexually violated. I have suicidal ideations, but they're something I can work through and continue going. 

I've never dealt with a self harmer and it's been a transition for me to try my best and be supportive, just as he has been supportive through the final proceedings of my divorce. 

He got admitted to the hospital again this last weekend. I had thought it was the same situation, from self harm and that he had admitted himself. Turns out he had went to his ex wives apartment, said  goodbye to his cat, thought she was gone, and went into his old bedroom to attempt. He has several stitches. 

I'm not sure how to process this. I knew we were both in a hard place, and I had been talking to my therapist on how we are taking it slow. My therapist says that it's okay to be open to something new and we sometimes can't control if someone just happens to be in our lives that we have a connection with.

I don't like to see the staples, go to the hospital, and hear about all of this. Maybe it's selfish but I'm starting to feel this is too much for my mental health. If he had been successful, I don't know what I would've done. "
This is a special kind of hell. 
Why can’t people accept that things don’t get better for everyone. There are things in life that can’t change. There are certain things in life you can’t come back from or undo. Time machines don’t exist and things can get a lot worse actually. 
"Hello everybody. I just want to ask for some help. My gf wants to commit suicide.

She has a lot of mental problems but she doesn’t want to talk about them. I try my best but I think it’s not enough 

My gf has always been talking about suicide and that makes me so sad. If she commits suicide I think I would too…

That’s why I ask for some help to everybody in this server."
"well, really i was going to do it next month on my
birthday.

today at work i realized that i should do it sooner. i decided i would do it when i got home. and i honestly wish i did. instead, i got drunk with my coworkers. i’m home alone now but still super drunk and feeling good. i wish i had just stayed sober and killed myself. but now i can’t. i’m happy now. when im suicidal, happy, and drunk, i just want to be a dick to everyone else. i hate everyone. i hate everyone on this planet and i think everyone is worthless. i hate them i hate them i hate them.

"Hi friends,

I have been a lurker in this community for a long time. Among other things, this community is why I held out for some time, hoping for things to get better.

I have finally mustered the courage end it. Today, I finally booked a hotel room where I am going to hang myself. I left notes for a few people. It feels so real now. I have been suffering for a long time. Every time I think things will get better, they take a turn for the worse. This is the only way out for me. I know and understand this now.

At least there is one thing I can be certain of: there will be no more pain after I am dead. Thankfully, there is nothing after this life. 

Goodbye."
"I'm a 16y old Male and i'm really ugly. I have a wide crooked hooked nose, big forehead, different shaped eyes, puffed lips, small chin, i can keep going on forever.

At school I always cover my face and nose, and try to look down. When I get home I spend hours looking in the mirror and taking photos of myself from different angles and dreading my life. I have been doing the same thing for over 4 years now and I am really depressed that I look like this.

When someone takes a photo of me I get so embarrassed and feel like ending it when ever I see my reflection in a car mirror or anywhere. I see photos of other people online and wish I looked like them.

I do take care of myself, have good hygiene, dress well, get frequent haircuts, and go to the gym 5 times a week. But my face still looks like shit, I don't know what else to do. 

I want to end it, I hate my life and don't want to live like this. I wish I was born somewhat average and not this ugly."
"I’m currently having a suicidal breakdown over this. How pathetic. I just wish that I was born a boy. I can’t deal with this anymore. I’m not sure if I can wait a week to make my attempt. I don’t want to live anymore. I don’t want to live in this body anymore. It’s not mine. I can’t live like this. I don’t want to live the rest of my life not being a boy.

I can act and dress like one all I want but I will never be a boy. I will always be stuck with a female skeleton and XX chromosomes. And unless I magically get the money for surgery, I will always have breasts, a uterus, and a vagina. I will always be stuck in this body no matter how much weight I lose to make my breasts smaller or my period go away. I will always be a girl and I can’t stand it.

I want to die. I already fucked up this body that isn’t even mine and it’s covered in scars and cuts. I can’t do this anymore. But knowing me the worst I will do is cut myself open. Pathetic."
"I feel like I don't belong in this world. It's like I'm just watching everything from the sidelines, not really connected or feeling anything. Feeling like I’m half dead and not really in my body. Seeing other people only makes me more unhappy and upset because they seem so involved and alive, while I feel like I'm on the outside looking in. I don't fit in, and I don't even feel human. It's really confusing to me that I exist here, living on this planet. It feels like I'm not supposed to be here. Depressions one thing but this is another. Like both mixed together."
"I’ve always wanted to die but recently I’ve been getting comments like “get in the chamber you filthy jew” and “H man should’ve finished you freaks off” on my posts everyday. I don’t want them to win, and I know they get what they want if I die. But so do I. I don’t wanna see what comes next. "

"I'm 35 (f) , and when I was 32 I met the love of my life. She was 13 years older than me, but that never mattered to either of us. She was bright, bubbly, mischievous in the best possible way and the light at the end of a very dark tunnel for me. I won't say my life has ever been easy. It's been marred by severe parental abuse, a stint of homelessness and the loss of my 2 year old son when I was 30 after we were hit by a drunk driver while walking home from the park. I won't go into details about the shit sandwich I experienced before I met my love. I guess it's not relevant. Myself and my love fell in love quickly, and were living together by the time we had known each other for 6 months. It might sound crazy, but I knew with every ounce of me very early on  that she was the one for me. We never really left the honeymoon phase of our relationship. We were just deeply in love. Two weeks ago, I lost the love of my life to a sudden aneurysm while she was at work. For 14 days I've been planning how to join her. For 336 hours I've been writing letters to our friends, donating my belongings and cancelling direct debits/notifying service providers that they'll no longer be required. Tonight. I think I'm going to do it tonight. I have everything I need to get the job done. I just need that last bit of courage. I've never been more sure of anything in my life than I am about not waking up."

Im fucking sick of people telling me this. My mental health is getting WORSE in fact.

"No bs, just getting straight into things. Every single job I've ever worked makes me want to off myself. Every. Single. One.
As an American, the fact that we're just getting bent over and fucked in the ass by our government and everyone is just taking it is so crazy to me, that I can hardly comprehend it. Am I seriously the ONLY ONE? If I ever talk about this with family or anything, they look at me like I'm crazy for not wanting to bust my ass to get paid 1/3 of what it costs just to put food on the table and afford a roof over my head. With all these jobs paying you jack shit, how can anyone even afford LIFE with the way the cost of living is these days? Who the fuck wants to spend 40+ hours a week making someone else richer at a place they don't want to be in, being around a bunch of idiots, just to get paid enough to buy McDonald's like twice a week whilst living under a bridge. Gtfo of here with that shit. The worst part of it is that there's no choice. I mean, you can CHOOSE to be homeless and starve to death, but what kind of alternative is that? Both options make me want to just start ropemaxxing regardless because of how futile it all is. No matter what choice I make, I will be poor, miserable, and unhappy/suicidal, because death is the only way out of the rat race. Like they say, the only way to win is to not play.  Fuck this shit. All these bots and NPC's can continue struggling and slaving their lives away for breadcrumbs, I'm checking out. "
Most people typically say the want to kill themselves but don’t want to die. I genuinely feel I want to die but don’t want to have to kill myself. Like I wish I were to be hit my a car or diagnosed with a terminal illness just so I don’t get the blame. I just want to go home :(

"I’m 25 and will be starting a new job soon. I’ve dealt with suicide attempts and depression my entire teenage to adult life. It’s a miracle I even made it to 25. 

Soon I will start a new job that pays pretty well. I’m going to save up some money to buy a gun and kill myself by the end of this month or early February. 

My parents think I’m getting better, but I lie to them everyday. I lie to everyone constantly how I feel. The SSRIS and the combination of other drugs don’t help. My brain is a total mess. 

I’ve been watching a video of a guy blowing his head off over and over recently. Life’s problems can end so fast and it’s easy. It’s someone else’s mess to clean up. (Literally)"
"I wish I wasn’t attracted to boys I wish I wasn’t ugly I wish people talked to me I wish I could eat more I wish I could have friends I wish I was loved I wish I didn’t hurt myself.


I wish people would just treat me normally."
"The worst part is I'm not exaggerating.

I am a medical disaster. I deal with symptoms so bad all I can do is lay in bed all day. If I do more than that my symptoms become even worse. It's chronic. No cure, no treatment. All because I was at the wrong place at the wrong time and got COVID.

A dog would have been put down for this. People would talk about how it was humane to euthanise it so it wasn't suffering longer.

So why isn't it the same for me? People like me suffer constantly yet we're expected to put up with it. Hell, some people accuse us of being lazy. It's insane.

 It feels so unfair that I've been robbed of everything that makes me ""me"" and I just have to live on and ignore both my symptoms and the overwhelming grief of losing myself. I can't go on like this.

Also sorry for posting kinda frequently here, I just feel so much more understood here. "
Is anyone suicidal but they don’t feel anything so they can’t do it and feel trapped? I’ve been slipping away mentally for a long time. I’m disassociated from everything. I can hardly type this or look at anyone. I can’t talk or complete sentences. I think about losing my life every day.
"⚠️TW: abuse, r@pe

I've made my decision and my consciousness is clear. I tried my very best since the age of 7 and I did everything to make something good out of my life, and most importantly, to recieve love. 

Didn't happen. Not even my family could love me, never had the luck of having friends or the blessing of a partner. 

As a newborn already my father wanted me dad because I was born half-paralyzed. My mother never loved me or stood out for me when my father abused me over the years. She almost drowned me as well on purpose. I hid in our garden and ran away several times, I asked other family members to please help. They silenced me.

People I thought are friends betrayed me, humiliated me and left me in the worst times of my life.

Guys and men... Other than being called ugly and Gollum by them, and being r@ped, nothing. Romantic love was the last hope of my life after all the trauma that happened and life refused to give me this one thing as well.

I accomplished things, I tried to find a safe haven in education, hobbies and sports, and successfully won competitions, wrote five books and several short stories. Some got published and won a university competition too, when I wasn't even 16 yet. But no matter these 'materialistic' accomplishments or successes, I always, whole my life never felt happy. Not once. No matter the ""kindhearted spirit"" (as someone said) of mine, no matter the socialization. There was no one to smile at me or hug me. There was no one to care about me. People used me to help them then threw me away when they got well. 

I'm utterly defeated. I can find nothing anymore to hold onto and all my hope died. 

My birthday is coming in 7 days and I can't force myself anymore to live and face the shame of another year passing with pure abuse and humiliation and s3xual abuse. 

I can't force myself to live anymore and no one f*cking cares that I will die.

Goodbye to everyone who never even knew I was in trouble, and goodbye to those who very well knew and did not help. 

And please, if you read it this far, check on your friends and loved ones. You never know what they might be going through. You might save someone with your kindness.

Goodbye.

"
I really want to kill myself like more than anything. I'm just scared. I Cant take life anymore. I gave myself a 4 month grace period and life is just getting worse. I can't do this shit anymore. I'm 31 and I'm really tired 
"I've heard the ""it gets better"" and ""you're just not trying hard enough/being lazy as hell"" way too many times.

In reality, the world is all about fucking money. Okay, don't get me wrong, I like the concept of money, but it's very, very hard to do the things that make you happy with little or no money.

No matter how hard you try to make a difference, it does not work.

When I go outside, I see people with 4-5 friends together. Literally every other person has a girlfriend. I am not saying that these people have the best life, I never know the other person's personal individual problems. And sometimes I feel lucky not to be them. For example, half of the people I see in groups are smokers...honestly let me tell you, I hate smoking and the smell. I can't imagine doing it (because it becomes an addiction very quickly) and every time my teeth smell, damage, when I go with other people, everything smells and I have to change all my clothes immediately, etc.

Everything is just so fucked up, you can get stuck in a dead-end job, that is the easiest thing. Or you can get an education to ""get a better paying job"" later, sure, but it doesn't work that way. How the fuck is life predictable when everyone only cares about money and you see how hard it is to get into a job interview?

""Everyone cares/is worried about you"" (very ironic). Yet the norms of kicking someone when they turn 18 are perfectly acceptable in society. No, almost no one cares, not even family.

I don't see how someone who turns 18 immediately becomes an adult. It is assumed that they should/can take care of themselves completely.

How is that even possible at 18, seriously? How do you even pay your rent, bills, everything?

If you are mentally ill/unstable, you will not be accepted by society. You will be seen as a worthless piece of shit with the only difference that people will almost never tell you outright in public ""so as not to insult you,"" yet you will be much more insulted when it comes time to get a job, try to start a relationship, and such. 

You are made to believe that you have values and a purpose in life when you are younger, which is an insult. I would much rather have known what a piece of shit I was when I was 11-13 and even been homeless at that age to see how fucked the world is and even if I had the chance to end it all back then.

""Life has a meaning if you make it."" How does someone with a chronic illness, for example, make sense of life in such a shitty society?

Like, let me tell the truth of what I see, the only reason I see someone with severe chronic lilness respected at a young age is because their parents pay for it at that age and/or government support which is 1.) generally very little money 2.) this doesnt change anything. If everything is about fucking money, how do you get to enjoy life? Like nowadays you cannot even afford to go to a restaurant because all the prices are outrageous. Every parent gives their kid a phone / tablet because their sense of being a parent is that their kid will feel entertained for free in the phone (like Youtube videos, video games....)

The most classic reaction of people when they see that someone's child has severe mental problems is ""heh, get your child some professional help"" or ""take his phone/tablet for a few days and you'll see how he'll stop acting like a baby very quickly."" You cannot react like this when you see a parent struggling badly; you literally cannot. Most parents already know/have tried most of these things, and if someone tells you that, it usually makes the situation worse.

I have much more to say, but I honestly cannot bother to say it all. I will just hope that an overdose of sleeping pills will work.

Goodbye Everyone"
"I’m leaving this here for when my phone is inevitably checked afterwards, because I don’t want to contact anyone now to say it.

To my ex - I’m sorry. For everything. I know I hurt you and broke up the family. I’ve tried to put things back together, but I’ll never be able to take away what I did. I’ve always loved you. I wish we could still be together. I wish we could at least still be friends, but I just can’t let go. You’re better without my constant begging to get back together because I just can’t move on. This isn’t your fault, it never has been. It’s me. It’s my mistake. You’ll find someone better if you haven’t already, you’re an amazing woman. Thank you for the last 17 years. I couldn’t have asked for any more from you x

To my kids - I’m sorry. I’m sorry I hurt the family. I’m sorry that my actions meant that we couldn’t do the things you love together anymore. I regret it so much and wish things were different. I just want to be able to spend every day with you both, tuck you in at night, wake up to you jumping on the bed in the morning, see your faces light up Christmas Day and all the other things a good dad should be able to do. But I can’t, because I’m not a good dad. You’re both amazing kids, and you’ll have someone you can call dad one day who can actually be there for you properly.

To Reddit - thank you for caring. I appreciate the outreach of support, but I’m at peace with myself now.

Goodnight and goodbye x"
"what do i fuckin do now?? life sucks, everyone sucks my life is shit and i cant even die properly. should I just buy a gun and make it easier? i dont even feel relieved that i survived it just made me feel worse that im alive. fucking help im so lost"
"Y’all don’t give a shit about me. The ones who lie and say I can talk to them whenever are all just lying cause they always stop replying after only a few days. People never reply to comments here or anywhere on Reddit. And everyone is quick to jump down my throat for everything I say, when I have a hard time communicating. I’m an engineer I think more logically, language was always harder for me. How many times do I have to feel suicidal for anyone to give a shit?"
"I want to die. Not because I want the pain to stop, not because I see relief in it, but because I just don’t want to be here anymore. Pain has nothing to do with it. I just don’t want to exist in this world anymore. I don’t want to be a part of it. I don’t want to be anything. I just wanna be dead. I wanna be no one. I want to be gone, that’s it. Darkness, end of games. I’m not here anymore."
"I posted this on r/self, but the comments were so fucking awful and racist and I didn't expect it at all, I feel awful and have been having so many panic attacks since and for months I've been feeling suicidal because of my background, I wonder why I was even cursed being a Pakistani"

"Idek how people keep going. I can’t do another decade like this. Meds don’t work, therapy don’t work, activities don’t work. I’m just exhausted and want to stop feeling like this. Sleep is the only time I feel peace, so why not sleep forever."
Life is so damn hard.
"2 weeks ago my boyfriend of a year took his own life abruptly. he didn’t even talk to me the whole day and i was left in the dark as to if he was okay until the next morning. he got in a fight with his mother and he shot himself out of anger. the first few days after i found out i just cried and was in denial. at times i’m still in denial. his funeral was open casket and it fucks with me a lot to remember how he looked. how he was cold and he didn’t look himself and just everything that comes with death. i couldn’t bring myself to hold his hand but i touched his face and i put my hand on his chest. his funeral was the first one i’d ever been to. i’m only 17. he was only 18. after his funeral i told my mom i was thinking about killing myself so she took me to the hospital and i stayed in the psych ward for 5 days but it did nothing for me. nothing seems to help. i’m extremely socially awkward, he was really my best friend and practically my only friend and it feels as though i have nothing left. i’m so depressed i don’t know how i’m ever going to be able to go back to work, or finish school, or eventually be in some other relationship. it all just looks so impossible. and it doesn’t help that i hear stories of people who lost their partners to suicide and they never get better either. it’s just hopeless. i just want my boyfriend back. this life is hell."
"So, to put some context, im 17yo, turning 18 in april. I've been mentaly struggling a lot for years now. It started when i was 14 and it never got better. I don't have any friends or anyone my age who talks to me, i rarely ever go out of my house because im terrified of going out on my own (its like a phobia). And im terrible at school, i go to a fashion, sewing kind of highschool and i really stopped going for months, i won't be able to graduate highschool for sure and honestly, i never felt like my family supported me. I atempted suicide at 15yo, my parents just bought me a pet chinchilla and told me not to it again. Once i got out of the hospital, they never mentioned it again and never took me to therapy or anything. Last year, my school told my parents i really needed a psychiatrist, and my parents didn't really tried to find one. I started to feel very alone in this, like if no one seemed to care if i got better or not. Im unable to go to school since im not able to go out on my own, my parents tells me im lazy and failed in life. My mom is planning on leaving as im turning 18. Im lost and don't now what to do. I just want to end this mess.

Sorry for the bad english, its not my first language"

I’m hurting and I just want it to stop.

People are quick to say that things get better but then they get even worse.

Suicide might be a permanent solution but some problems are permanent too. Not everyone gets a happy ending.

I want to be happy for others but lately I just see a life not meant for me.

I can’t go on like this. I’m attempting again tonight, but knowing me I’ll fuck that up too. Can’t succeed in anything, not even death"
"She just tried to kill herself by injecting a bunch of insulin while I was asleep, and it didn't work.  It isn't the first time I have experienced her doing something like this, but she told me that she is trapped and I would be better off without her around.  So we talked a little and she promises to get some therapy, but I honestly don't know how to feel.  We are acting like nothing happened, but I know that's weird and I know that nothing is being solved, but I just feel like why should I care.  I just want it to go back to normal, but I don't think it ever will be.  If anyone has any advice I'd appreciate it."
Nobody gives a fuck about me right now but if I kill myself all of a sudden everybody will feel bad and be screaming and crying. Where was the same energy when I actually needed it?
I hate being 5’7 and bald at 20. No girl wants me. There’s no more reasons for me to live. All I ever wanted was to be loved and cared for like a normal person. I don’t think that’s ever going to happen unless I pay for it.
"the only reason i havent killed myself is because im scared of what will happen to me when i die. Christians say you will be deemed to HELL for eternity. for this reason i do not believe God is good anymore. how could u call urself so holy and pure if u send people who feel like they have no other options but to leave this earth and u just send them to hell? sorry god but wtf is wrong w u, how could u do that to someone. is that my fate too? will my suffering end only to begin another and burn and be tortured for infinity? will i ever get a break? should i just hope i die in a horrible accident like put myself in dangerous situations so my death is ruled an accident and ill go to heaven? but how long will that take? i dont want to wait anymore. im done waiting for a reason i shouldnt
 everything points to yes. maybe i deserve to rot in hell with the devil. maybe that's where i belong. maybe that was mj fate all along. and u cant change fate, can u? no, u cant. its ur destiny. since the day i was born, i was destined to rot in hell."
"Hello, this is my ever first post on Reddit and I'm not national English speaker, so I'm sorry if something is not right.

My husband which I married this year wanted to commit suicide today. He's Mongolian and I'm Czech, we met through Tinder right after he came to Czech and have been together since.
We love each other so much that we would die for each other, we never argue and talk everything out instead. He's the best husband you can imagine and he's the most important person to me.

We have some problems in our life but everything is getting solved lately that's why I don't know why he wanted/wants to commit suicide.

He got really drunk today afternoon at home and when he gets really drunk he tends to talk weird stuff but never before about suicide until today.
He started talking like he wants to kill himself, he's not good enough for me and I married him because I pitted him. I was trying to get something out of him that would tell me more.
He told me he feels like that for a long time by now.. even before we met each other, that he wanted to kill himself when he turns like 30yo maximum until he met me. He had really hard life so I get it. 

Then he was talking about ending his suffering with suicide and he won't feel anything anymore and he wouldn't care about me and family cause he will be dead and won't feel a shit..

Gladly our friend called and told him that he got a great job for my husband that he wanted so he got him out of it a bit. When they finished the call it seemed like he got better, he was calling with friend from Korea and I thought it's gonna be fine now. I gave him a bit of space cause he wouldn't do anything to himself while calling with his friend. When he finished the call he told me they were talking about him wanting to kill himself tonight while I'm sleeping.

He was talking about how he loves me so much and wants to be with me but on the other hand he wants to end suffering for me and others and before we met I was smiling and stuff and now I have depression and social anxiety. And that I'll forget about him and find someone better than him.

He even attempted a suicide today, wanted to kill himself with a gillette, gladly as he was drunk he mistook the side of the gillette. I didn't know about it until he told me because I had no idea he would actually do something like this.

In the end I talked him out of it, not even sure how anymore and I put him to sleep. I don't want to sleep because I'm worried about him and don't want to tell our friends about it cause they're our together friends.

I'm worried that he may try it again soon even though he said he's not going to. 

And yes.. I was thinking about calling ambulance and taking him to the hospital but in our situation it would ruin us both and he wouldn't forgive me ever.

Did someone go through something similar with their loved one and can give me some tips how to act around him and make him not do it? I'm pretty desperate and need to talk about it with someone.

Thank you in advance."
"Hi folks. I made a throwaway and came as far from the socials I normally use because I just wanted to leave my feelings here without judgement, without guilt tripping with “oh your poor family” as if they weren’t a large reason I’m here right now. I have nobody. I have nothing. I’m functionally homeless. All the good things in my life are overshadowed by pain. I’m extremely mentally ill and despite my intensive work in therapy and psychiatry, I still find myself desiring to pass in my sleep daily. I have a lot of medication. Not even from hoarding, I have so many fucking conditions I’m on a plethora of pills. I have been sexually, physically, emotionally abused. My bpd causes my relationships with people I love to become toxic and strained. I see so much happening for others that has never and will never happen for me. I told my therapist that some people are destined to live short, sad lives. My aunt was one of those people. I’m like her in many ways I think. I wish she was still around, I don’t think anyone gets it. I’m sorry for the burden guys. Thank you for caring.

"I gave myself a month to live on the 6th of November. That means I've overstayed my welcome by 10 days.

These have been the worst 10 days of my life. I forgot that I'd even planned to kill myself on that date, but felt awful since it passed anyways. Maybe it's a sign from God. 

I think I might end up hanging myself tonight. What held me back was the ""need"" to buy a rope, but I guess a belt works the same. 

I don't know why I feel the need to share this. Maybe there's this stupid part of me with hope left, but I just can't do this anymore. Nobody cares and help is inaccessible to me at this time, and I can't live like this anymore.

I'll give myself a few hours of insomnia, and then I'll feel just about crazy enough to do it. I'm so depressed."

"My husband (35M) and I (26F) have been married for 4 years. He has had several bouts of suicidality throughout our relationship. This most recent one has me feeling especially hopeless, as I feel we’ve exhausted all avenues. Therapy, medication, ER visits, inpatient psych stays, diet, exercise, spiritual approaches, you name it. He is a very physically healthy person. 

He tells me he is broken and can’t be fixed, that his parents f*cked him up so badly and that he is convinced this damage is permanent. He isolates himself and refuses to open himself up to others. Medications have either worked temporarily or made things worse. I know this is manipulative, abuse, etc., but if I leave him I am confident he would kill himself. I am not condoning that as an ultimatum, but it is an apparent truth I have to navigate. 

I love my husband, he is my best friend. I have dreams for our life and for a family, but I don’t see them happening with a father/husband this unstable, self-loathing, and misanthropic.  I am at the end of my rope, and I know he’s at the end of his.

Any well-intentioned advice is appreciated. 

Update: Thank you all for the compassion and advice, it is more appreciated than you know. Talking through these options with him have at the very least got him thinking about immediate next steps that aren’t suicide, which is all I can ask for at the moment. "

I know that it would hurt so many people if I did it and I kind of remember how much I loved life before everything that happened these last months. I was a positive person. Healthy. My relationship with my partner was beautiful until the moment he started splitting due to his disorder. Life is meaningless now. I am not able to study.

346 days ago, I posted on this thread that I was going to kill myself. And I went through with it and attempted multiple times. Ofc I’m still here which means that I didn’t achieve what I tried to do. But I’m glad that I didn’t. A year ago, I was in the worst state of my life ever. I was in an extremely abusive relationship, I lost my job, I lost my friends, and I lost my family. I was bought to the hospital to be treated for a few days.

Fast forward a year today, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. I left the abusive relationship, I have a new job, I reconnected with friends and family, made new friends, travelled to new countries, got tattoos, cut and dyed my hair, got into dance, started volunteering, started doing off broadway shows, was in a music video just two weeks ago, and so much more.

I went from never moving out the bed every. Single. Day. And now everyday I wake up, exercise, work, take my vitamins, cook healthy meals, write gratitude journals, and spend time doing things that bring joy.

There are days ofc that I wake up with anxiety and moments of PTSD and yeah they fucking suck, but each day has gotten better and continues to. I didn’t believe anyone when they said it gets better and I won’t say that it definitely will at a certain point in time, but I will say that there is hope and there is a damn good chance that it will. It took a lot of hard work and time, but it got there. And I hope that for those reading this and struggling, that you stay to reach this point too."
"please tell me how to not be scared, im out i left my house ive basically found the building high enough. I could easily be dead in a few minutes but im scared, my family will be home in a bit and then i'll get in so much trouble for leaving the house. Please tell me to stop being scared i just wanna get out of here"
"I hate using this term because of the stigma with it, but is what I am. I don’t refer to myself as one irl, and I don’t hate women and I don’t want to disrespect anyone. That being said, I’m sick of being 22 and still never even having been told yes when it comes to a relationship, I don’t resent anyone for rejecting me, I’m just exhausted of all the rejection. Especially when it comes to being seen as just friends with girls… I get they can’t control who they attracted to and all, it’s just I feel so done tbh. I really liked this last girl tbh, but she just doesn’t see me that way… I genuinely thought she liked me cuz we would flirt a lot, but turns out she wanted our mutual friend after all even tho both of them said they don’t see each other like that but now they dating…. I just don’t get it anymore…. I’m not mad at  her but I’m just so hurt and can’t see her anymore. And I’m okay with having female friends btw just not girls I like…. And I understand women don’t owe me anything, but why even stay alive if no one ever wants me… I really try to keep improving myself, I’m almost done with school,I workout everyday, I quit drugs, and take care of myself physically in every way, yet I’m still never enough, and strangers say it’s my personality but that doesn’t make sense cuz then I wouldn’t have friends at all…. I think I want to end it all tomorrow after I get a few things in order. I’m not willing to deal with being rejected anymore. (And this has nothing to do with sex, it has everything to do with being loved) advice is welcome, but please I’m begging you not to shit on me for expressing my feelings."
"I’m not from the US, so this isn’t related to the elections in any way. I just need to vent, and I figure there’s enough negativity around here that my post won’t disrupt anyone else’s experience. I’m in my early 20s, and I already feel like I’ve failed at life. I’m a college student, but I can’t seem to find the motivation to keep studying what I’m passionate about because everything around me feels destined to fall apart. I’m frustrated and discouraged because I can’t land an internship, while others around me seem to find jobs effortlessly. Meanwhile, my pathetic ass is sending out resumes with little to show for it, while people with less experience secure well-paying roles without breaking a sweat. You might think I should just focus on my studies and be a good student, but even that feels impossible because I can’t stop comparing myself to others. It honestly feels like I’ve been stuck in the same rut since 2018, reliving the same day over and over again. I often create imaginary scenarios in my head about what life in university and in my household would be if I committed suicide. Would I be mourned? Would I be missed? Probably, but only for like a month at best. After that I'd be forgotten and no one would even remember I existed at all. My dog passed away a year ago, and before that, my grandfather—who was my greatest mentor—died the year prior. I’m sure you can imagine how deeply that’s impacted my mental health. All I want is to be able to treat myself to things without feeling like a burden to anyone. Is that too much to ask?  
I know my problems may not seem as significant as what others are sharing here, but I just needed to vent. I don't usually talk about my issues with people in my life because I'm afraid of either damaging my image or being judged. So, I prefer to open up to strangers on the internet instead."
"i met him off grindr and we spoke a few weeks, he met my sister and friends. we had a good time, he never did anything to insinuate or hurt me. we got stoned, i told him i didnt feel well. we went to bed and i heard him crying behind me, i should've asked him what was wrong but i ignored him; i heard him whisper, ""im so scared."" he didnt rape me in a normal way, he came on me over 20 times times i should've said no i was so scared i didn't. i pretended to be asleep so he would stop. i cant even sleep in the same bed as someone. i should've said stop i could've prevented it. i didn't, i wish i did. i cant keep going, my body isnt mine anymore. my life has been taken from me, my body has been destroyed. i can never feel clean. i want it to stop "
That’s it. I’m done. Life isn’t worth living at all. There’s no hope for me and nobody cares about me. I’m done. Nobody needs me here.
"Tonight I'm going to cut my veins. I have been suffering in silence for months and I can no longer stand this pain. I mutilate myself quite often but I decided to do something, I'm going to kill myself. This pain will disappear, my loved ones will be at peace, everyone is a winner. I don't want anyone to die, but I decided to act for myself, for my own good. goodbye everyone, take care of yourself and the people you love."
"I fucking hate it. It's not like my body is fucking curvy and sexy or whatever. But ever time I look in the mirror I think that all my worth is in is sex. So I have this weird thing where I look at my body and have the two conflicting feelings that I both want to be a man and that all I'm worth is for to jerk off on or something. 

I just feel sick. And done. Idk anymore."
I am about to slip. The final part of me that wants to live is slipping. Please give me something to live for before I jump in front of a fucking train.
"parents dead of overdoses, in and out of different homes, my sister goes to rehab tonight, im turning 18 soon with no money, unstable housing, no job, no ID, no car, no drivers license, no insurance. im trying to apply to job corps but it’s so frustrating and all of it is so overwhelming it has me considering probably the most level-headed suicide attempt i’ve ever had.

statistically there’s probably nothing left for me  for the next few years of my life except struggling and poverty. what the hell is the point of this 💀 like actually im doing nothing except taking up other people’s resources. why am i having to fight to survive at 17. most suicidal people just have the mental issue with a changeable life, but it feels like everything in my life is LAUGHABLY getting worse and i have the worst luck ever. i was basically doomed from the moment my parents died. 

i’m not built for this, i don’t want to suffer any longer and be desperate and needy just to fucking SURVIVE. not even living, surviving. i hate this all so much. "
"By now something should have happened. I did the research. Liver failure, kidney failure, all that. But I'm completely fine. What's wrong with me???"
I feel so ashamed and nobody understands my situation. I was suicidal for months and it got worse and starting thing about it everyday. I switch my medication hoping it would help. She put me on two SSRI's at once and I believe I had serotonin syndrome. I don't even remember my attempt. Now everyone knows and I feel like a monster. I was even asked by a family member why did I have kids if that's what I am going to do. Obviously it I would have known this before hand I wouldn't have had kids. Someone doesn't just wake up a day hey I want to become mentally ill with kids. No one understands and attempting just made me feel worse about myself.
"Nothing bad is happening or has happened to me. I'm not doing anything actually, staying in my room for most days. There's just no point to living. Reality doesn't feel real somehow, I don't feel real. Waking up is a chore, so is eating. I'm not seriously considering a future because I'm not sure if I'll be alive for it. I can't feel connected to people despite talking to them or hanging out with them. I frequently felt sad or anxious in the past but now it's mostly apathy. If I were more brave or more determined, I think I would have ended myself already, but it's too much effort. "
"Let me lose my life to anything please, I’m begging"
I’m almost 30 now. I’ve been in therapy for that whole time. I’ve hated myself that whole time. I’ve done all the ridiculous things they tell you to do to “heal”. I’m not any closer. I want to jump in front of a metro car and end everything. I am tired of suffering.
"I'm sitting here feeling like shit. Knowing that my actions will devastate my older daughter.

Two times has she now unknowingly saved my life, this little wonderful soul.

First was when she was 15 months old.
I would always feed her at night. And change her diaper. 

Normally she would just take the bottle and chug it, holding it herself. While I changed her diaper. Then go back to sleep. This night I had 8-10 beers, was gonna wrap my car around a tree.

As I'm getting dressed sneaking out in the night, I hear her fuzzing. So I make a bottle. When I bring it to her, she drops it and just waits for me to change her. Thinking maybe she wasn't hungry and only needed the diaper changed I take the bottle and open the door to leave.

She then whisper her word for bottle. So I hand it to her again, she drops it. And says her word for bottle again, so I hold the bottle (she always wanted to hold it herself) and she grabbed my thumb with her little hand, and just held it. Even after the bottle was empty, and wouldn't let go until she fell back asleep.

I took that as a sign that even if I feel worse than bad someone needed me...
I sat up that whole night crying, determined to do everything I could to make a change.

I did nothing worked... 

It's now 7 years later. And I have my two daughters every other week.

Everything is worse, more physical/mental ailments. Economy is borderline eviction...

My daughter calls me as I'm setting up for another attempt while they are at their mother's house. And says she got a bad feeling, she worried about me because I used always be happy for xmas. But not this year. 15-30m before I was gonna go through with it. (Guess I couldn't hide it)

She can't/shouldn't have to save me thrice... 

I have made videos for them wishing them happy birthday/xmas/new years. 
For the next 15 years.

And a longer one, where I explain. That they couldn't have done anything different. That they were perfect just the way they are. But dad was broken for too long. ( On USB stick that I hid in my ex house when I dropped of the kids last, she will determine when that video is ok to watch. If ever...)

I'm so sorry... That I won't see you again.
I'm so sorry that we won't laugh together again.
I'm sorry I won't be here for the good and the bad as you two grow up.
I'm sorry that this was the last Christmas we spent together...
I'm sorry I couldn't get better... 

You are the joy of my life, dad loves you more than there are stars in the sky. 
And you both shine like stars. 

Dad tried, I really, really did... For 9 years
I wish I could feel another way, and stay...
But dad has to go away... 

I will love you forever and ever. To the moon and back...




UPDATE: I woke up this morning, and after reading all of your comments I'm overwhelmed. Thank you for the kind uplifting words. 

The biggest reason I have to convince myself into staying. Is the high potential of passing on the mental issues onto them. As one person mentioned. It's made me scrap plans before. That's why I have hung on as long. 

One part of me just wants to make it look like a winter driving accident. 

I do feel guilt, and not being good enough. Things that used to be easy. Now feel like climbing mountains. I do feel useless. 

And I've made myself completely isolated over the years not to burden those around me. Stupid I know, but never having energy to visit or chat with anyone made it to exhausting. And the relationships being totally one-sided brought on another level of anxiety. 

Seeing my daughters faces as I drop them off, and pick them up at kindergarten/school. Hurts me deeply, because I'm counting down the days we have left. And it's not fair to them, I know that.

My older daughter asking if we can do certain things the week after next have me almost breaking down infront of them, because I don't plan on being here then. And I feel absolutely horrible, knowing that the week will never come.

I'm considering staying. Not to implode their lives. Hopefully I deteriorate fast, and I won't be my choice.

They do deserve that much, when you become a parent nothing is about you anymore.
I do love every second we spend together...

I'm just at my ropes end. I feel dammed if I do, dammed if I don't. "
"  
I've been lying to everyone about my suicidal ideations bc I'm scared of their dismissive/angry reactions (it happened before, mom almost threw away my bedroom door after I came home from the hospital and my classmates stopped talking to me bc they didn't know how to give support)  
My parents are emotionally neglectful and they know it, they never knew how to handle me when I cried as a baby or asked for help as a kid. Most of my life they didn't even looked at my face while I used to come home telling about the bullying and the sexual assaults since my first years of school. After 16, I stop wasting my time telling them abt this kind of stuff, it only hurted more  
Both had pretty awful childhoods, they are also traumatized but it doesn't justify the way they treat me, I never deserved this  
I don't have siblings nor a close family, barely friends   
I'm 20 and dropped out of art school this month  
My depression makes it hard to find a job and therapy isn't improving like it used to do (and I can barely afford it)

I started taking meds and tried to kill myself when I was 17 bc I knew that I wouldn't survive living in this environment, I already knew it would be such struggle and very few ways of getting good professional help (also my country isn't doing well)  
And nowadays it's hard to find a good therapist for a reasonable price here...  
When I was like 6, I was forced by school to go to a therapist and they slept at the first session, it messed up my self-esteem for many years  
Why... why most people can't look at me in the eyes when I'm down...? Even when I'm fragile, holding theirs hands, controling my urge to cry, I'm trying so hard to be a healthy human being so that they don't get scared of the amount of pain I've been hiding for years   
When things get really hard, I isolate myself in my bedroom and try to resolve my problems alone, that's the way my parents do, that's what they taught me to do: don't bother the ones who love you the most or else they'll get tired, but always be available to them when they ask for help, always  
And nowadays I often smile around people, I laugh easily and frequently around strangers  
I like to act like a clown, I've been used to it: a way of entertaining people so that they'll stay just a lil bit longer and to make them see me as non-threatening person  
But they never stay for more than 2 years, eventually they find better and healthier people to be around...  
I've been emotionally rejected countless times and I don't ask for much really :(  
My parents often moved around so I went to like 10 different schools across the state, I never got to have a long lasting friendship   
I'm so scared of being used and then abandoned that there's days I just get really silent, weeks of silence   
I learned to stay quiet while being beaten up  
I saw my boyfriend this week, met some people yesterday  
But when I open up my heart, nobody knows how to react, not even him  
When the tears fall, they physically distance themselves AND WATCH ME JUST LIKE MY FUCKING MOM DOES  
Their silence breaks me, some brush it off, ""oh you're are so sensitive, so delicate"" or the very well known ""oh that's so sad I wish I could help but there's nothing I can do really""  
It makes me go back all over childhood again  
I've never been more lonely as of now  
Some say I'm a great listener, but they rarely ask futher when I say I'm not okay, it's like they avoid interacting with me when they see me down  
Why everyone struggles w helping others, even their loved ones? They don't even risk trying to give comfort  
I don't expect my parents to be self-aware and treat me with basic emotional support one day, they think that the way they act is perfectly normal bc of their past, even tho I showed them the consequences of this shit before  
We never travelled to the beach, we only got out to have fun when I was a small kid, we don't celebrate things together or have lunch together (it always ended up in a mess afterwall)  
They have poor hygiene, poor social skills (they spent their lives focusing on work, academic achievements)   
And begging for a little bit of attention isn't worth my energy anymore, it just makes me even more suicidal  
And once I was a rebellious teen, I did everything that I could and they barely attended school meetings  
School staff were also neglectful, but I never expected much of them

I wanted to left this house for so long, I learned how to survive alone in the most disgusting places without a word for years, but I have no roommate to share the rent, It's really expensive for me to move out right now   
I wan't to be a musician, an animatior and do voluntary work, which means that the chances of receiving a good amount of money to survive are low and unstable   
I want to give the comfort that I never had, but wish some too

I stopped cutting and as of late I've been drinking until I pass out alone  
We are poor bc of their lack of money management and alcohol numbs my head when I'm hungry or having suicidal thoughts   
When I tell my therapist abt this stuff, she says that I should go to a psych ward  
But I stayed there when I was 17 and having to come back home was worse than everything I've been trough 

The worst part was never the physical abuse, it was the emotional neglect afterwards   
And hey, I just want to thank you, dear reader, who read all this sad stuff... thank you so much for the attention, thinking that someone read this feels like a hug  
Tomorrow I'm seriously thinking of being drunk and staying on the rooftop, watching the city at night  
I'm scared of being drunk on the streets and being taken advantage of by a stanger   
Overall, this life isn't worth living, it never was

My parents will miss me, but they'll eventually move on, I wasn't planned afterall, they weren't prepared to deal with another human besides themselves individually   
My boyfriend asked if I'd like to live with him, but I'm scared of going to a rural city and isolating myself even futher, we've been together for only 3 months now, it's hard to abandon this place even though it keeps destroying me bc it's the only location I've learned to survive for longer 

If I change my whole life, starting from zero, and something happens like the things written above, I'll go to a forest and immediately kill myself without hesitation   
And my life is getting worse, it's hard to emotionally support myself for 20 years. My parents don't mind going away without looking back, why should I stay alive? I'm tired of pleasing people who barely care for me, I want to die I want to die I want to forget everything and die I'm ready to feel what is like to die I want to die"
i fucking hate anxiety. hate depression. hate being alive and i hate wanting to die.
"Another year of being a broke loser with no friends, no job, and no life. I just want to die. I hate my life. It's a pathetic joke. I'm better off dead. Fuck 2024 and I never want to live to see another year if it's anything like this. "
"I can't take it anymore. I suffer a lot. I feel powerless, I can't do anything. I can't enjoy anything. I went to psychologist and psychiatrist before but then my father got in a fight with the psychologist over my treatment and now he forbids me to see therapists. "
"Whenever I see people who die accidentally, I feel so jealous. I’ve always wanted to die, but I know how painful it would be for others if I killed myself. Everyday I feel a little bit closer to my goal. I’m so exhausted of fighting my own mind, of not knowing what is real or what is imagined."
"it hurts to know that he has been bottling up all this guilt for having non hijabi daughters for this long. this is not the first time we went through this. i cannot live with him seeing me as a sin factory, i really want to end  everything once and for all this time but i'm afraid i'm too much of a coward. I have an exam tomorrow and i cannot even bring myself to study knowing that i have just made up my mind to quit it all and just off myself after years of debating. I have finally decided that it is just not worth fighting for anymore. there are few things in life worse than not ever being enougn to your dad who you spent your entire life just trying your best to make him proud of you, but it all goes out in vain because i dont have my hair covered"
"On monday feb 12, I stayed home from school. I went to my bathroom, got drunk, cut up my arm, and hung myself. I also had a gun for good measure. I sent goodbyes to some people and I passed out. 

I woke up on the floor to a phone call telling me the cops were at my house. They came in with paramedics and treated me. It was strange I felt very numb. I went to the er then to a psych ward. I stayed there for two days and now I'm at school.
 
The letters i wrote were read and many secrets are now known. Everyone keeps treating me like I'm crazy. They talk like one wrong word or tone will make me snap. Everyone says that they understand and want thinks to be better but they dont. I don't know what to do. I wasn't supposed to survive. I'm mad i did. What happens now."
"I tried. No one cared. Nothing changed. Can’t even vent without everyone just getting angry. Everyone is so angry. No one is compassionate anymore. No one even wants to understand. No one asks. No one listens. No one sees. No one notices. It’s just the same thing. “Get help. Go to therapy. It gets better. Eat shit. Fuck you.” I’m alone here in this room. I’ll be gone and OD’d from this stuff before the night is over. Sorry I wasn’t enough. Sorry I never mattered. Sorry I pissed you all off. Sorry I was a burden. But you’ll all be happier without me. Hell, who am I kidding? None of you will believe or even notice. I don’t even have a single family member or friend to remember my name. I was no one. I never existed. I hope you all find something to keep you going somehow. Not all of us find it. Maybe I almost did. But it’s too late."
"Studies have shown time and again that depression (particularly untreated depression) leads to brain damage. Suicidal ideations probably amplifies that. 

I’m young so I know my words don’t carry much weight, but I still strongly feel the following: being as depressed as I am, for as long as I have, does something to you. As dramatic as this sounds, I feel like mental illness has branded itself into my psyche, and no amount of treatment will ever reverse it. This alone makes me believe that some lives simply aren’t worth living. I’m still uncertain of whether or not I belong in that category, but I guess time will tell. I’m at the point where I don’t see things substantially improving, and I don’t really want to suffer for any longer than I already have. 

I dunno, I guess I worry my current dark perception of life will forever taint my perspective. Like, whatever progress I make will be moot because I will remember deep down how I am now, and thus will always feel that way to a degree. 

:("
"I just really want to not be a burden, but I will never ever fit into this world. I will never be happy. And having been told I am a burden, I think its time for me to plan it truly and properly. I need to organise: 

1) Someone to look after my fluff ball. 

2) My limited money to go somewhere good.

3) The method (Which i won't discuss here)

And that's it really. 

I wish i was braver. "
"Twenty seven. Living in this shitty country called Ireland. A shit job. Found happiness for a little bit, and then a bit more when I met my first and only girlfriend last year, who I loved more than anything and she dumped me and broke my stupid heart. Fuck all prospects apart from that. My only discernible achievements are - oh wait, I don't have any. 

  
I honestly just get happy at the idea of not having to suffer. It would be a godsend to never have to exist. I just imagine myself walking on a stairway to a place where I am free of the shackles of this pained existence. God, it's just so liberating."
"I'm genuinely perplexed by this. What is the point of living? 

We're merely just money-making machines in society until the day we perish. I don't want to live in a society like this, everything is just...horrible. 
Also as a female, Im just starting to feel like we are used for 'Reproduction and population growth' at this point. 

Its all so pointless. What's the point of living if my life is like this? Why is this considered a privilege?

Okay sure, you might have a point, being alive is:
'Very rare and lucky.' But for me, it's just mental torture, I wish I was aborted so that I didn't have to open my eyes in this world.

I feel so bad, for the newborns that finally awakened and opened their eyes into this:

'Beautiful world'

We are no different from puppets that have to live like this until the day we die, and the cycle just repats again. I just don't want to exist anywhere. Please, let me just get eradicated from existence. I don't serve purpose. I wish I just... disappeared.

Although some people may be more fortunate than others.. like, having friends or people that love them. For me, yea, I have them.

 But are they primarily present in my life?
Well, no. Not at all.

Society is absent-minded to people like me. Everyone has such a bad memory when it comes to me for some reason.People laugh when they mention my name, people make fun of me, people try to bring and talk about my trauma. Its all so pointless. I'm just too scared and afraid of everything. I'm so sick of it all.

No matter how much I try, It always ends up like this. Everyone forgets, everyone moves on with life. 

Am I a joke to you? Or am I just a delusion?

Why the hell do I exist? 

I wish I was dead. I would be better off dead...

I'm planning to commit suicide in a few years, I want to try and grasp tightly,just a little longer.
I've already half given up though, I lost too much hope in this humanity. I just want a hand, a hand that will awaken from this nightmare....

Despite the fact that I'm not religious, if God, or just anyone if you truly exist,just please tell me this sacred answer... 

""What's the point of living?""

"I wish I wasn’t Asian, I wish I wasn’t cursed to live in this body. For over two decades of my life, I’ve faced bullying and harassment for being Asian, even from my own family. Imagine all your life, you’ve been told that you’re ugly, you’re inferior, you’re ”different”. At some point you’ll start to believe them. I may not remember your name or face, but why do I remember your racial slurs, your eye pulling, your racial jokes, etc? If the world hates me, then time to leave it. All the cuts on my arms and legs don’t mean nothing.   


And the fact that I’m Chinese, I just couldn’t have been born as a cool Asian? Like Korean or Japanese? But instead I’ll be stereotyped as Ching Chong dog eating CCP. Dating isn’t great either. No non-Asian would want to date an Asian expect for those who fetishize us. I remember a period in my life where I had a mental breakdown because of my race and was planning on ending it. I saw no future for me. Then I got a brilliant idea to do a parasuicide as a cry for help, woke up a few hours later, and my Asian parents addressed the root of my issue and took me to therapy… SIKE! they made joke about it and still make jokes about it to this day. And recently, these thoughts have been returning.  


Body dysmorphia is a bitch. Sometimes I wish I could just cut my own epicanthic folds off.   


If I do kill myself one day, I hope to come back as any race but Asian. If I kill myself, it will be a big “fuck you” to my parents who refused to do anything about their daughter’s suicidal thoughts.

“Ching Chong ding dong” bitch stfu"
"Over the years I have realised people really don't care. They will tell you they won't leave you and eventually everyone leaves you when you need them.   
I told my therapist that i don't feel like talking anyone in my life. Atleast when i die the shock will be very minimum to everyone. Atleast, that won't give me hope to reach them to save me"
"Left a post about wanting to off myself because of different situations on r / borderlinepdisorder because it’s the only community I’ve ever had people seem to care about me in. Or understand me I guess. Had people upvote it and not reply. Don’t know how to take that. Too tired 

Edit: I am doing much better today. I didn’t expect all the support in the comments. Thank you guys from the bottom of my heart. Unfortunately my disorder makes my mental state switch rapidly and to extremes so it’s hard to get help when I’m super down and it doesn’t feel like I need it when I’m doing good. But seeing this today when I’m feeling better is motivating me to get more help. Thank you"

"I can't find a job, I'm ugly to women, I'm not good enough to be loved in this society that has been made. I'm looking forward to when I die each day. All I do now is take sleeping pills to get through the days. I don't care anymore. Everyone is so toxic to me and a fucking bully. I hope this fucking world blows up in the war their talking about because humanity fucked itself with it's own bullshit rules."
"I really dislike this kind of statement. The person ""showed no signs."" There are always signs.

I am by no means saying anybody, who missed the signs in somebody they lost by their own hand, could have done anything other than what they did. That is part of the problem I am trying to communicate.

I think about suicide a lot. A LOT. Method. Manner. Motive. I often wonder if today is going to be the day. Not so far. :/

When we say somebody ""showed no signs"", we are letting people off the hook. Not you, dear reader. If you lost somebody this way, you are a victim as I see it. There are always signs.

The problem is, they are taught not to show the signs. Long sleeves in summer. A razor blade tucked away in the desk. Crying alone in their room. Somewhere along the way, the person was taught they needed to hide the signs. It might have been a parent, a teacher, a bully, a friend, a grandfather, or just a misinterpreted scene in a movie. For me it was my mother. 

There is no chance to debrief, to contextualize, or to vent. I can't even say I necessarily blame whoever it was who taught them this lesson. I am sure they didn't even realize what they did. I tried to talk to my mom about the thoughts I had. She absolutely flipped out. Angry at me, the elementry school kid who realized life isn't actually worth living. It made an impression.

I am still here because I am a coward. Please don't contradict me on this with platitudes of ""no it actually means you are strong/brave/etc"". No, I assure you. Cowardice. The same feeling that kept me from riding roller coasters. The same feeling I get when I didn't want to jump off a cliff into the lake even after I watched my friends do it and turn out fine. Cowardice. The inability to face my fear in pursuit of something I want.

But to function, I can't show it. The few friends I have left would abandon me if I talked about suicide as often as I thought about it. Countless 'friends' have abandoned me. I couldn't hold a job if I came to work with visible, fresh cuts. I would be medicalized in the horrifying American health care system being a broke shlub.

So I hide it."
I will be 17 years old tomorrow and I will have no one to celebrate with. I have no friends and my parents don't care. I wish people cared about me. I've never been this alone in my entire life. 
"1 year ago today, i thought 2023 was gonna a be a fresh new start and here we are now same day next year left with NOTHING. i didn't get to graduate or left with any friends or any accomplishments,i made one mistake last year which was believing that i could live and i will not be repeating the same mistake this year, last year i was partying having fun with the people i had around me and now i'm gonna be alone in my room crying my eyes out and smoking weed so it'll hurt a bit less."
"I want to go home, but not to a physical place.

 I want to be 10 again and look forward to birthdays and weekends one more time. I want for Christmas to feel like magic and Easter to feel like color again. 

I want to go back to a time when I didn't know what a broken heart felt like. Not from love, but from the world itself and the impossible effort it takes to live and just get by.

 I want to think that profound sadness is a feeling you get when a friend leaves from a sleepover, and not the feeling I get when there's 10 minutes of silence and I have to face my thoughts and I realize the only reason I'm breathing is to not make my Mom cry.

I want to still believe in The Tooth Fairy and that it gets better some day or that life isnt always this hard. I want to be say ""I never wanna grow up"" and have it not shatter me into pieces because I'm 27 and life feels hopeless. . 

I'm tired, I want to sleep, and I want to go home."
"I have this sense that I am being abandoned/rejected by everyone. My friends don’t want me around, my family don’t want me around, my colleagues don’t want me around. Nobody likes me. I may as well just vanish because that’s what they want."

they go through his phone, they shout at him constantly, his siblings are all younger or don’t care for him. he’s 14 and is going to japan next week, planning to kill himself in a forest. 

please give advice, help, anything really. he’ll read the comments, he can’t even make a bloody post cuz of his parents."
"Well, I tried to OD myself last time. I locked myself in the room (where there's also a fridge in it) to commit suicide. Honestly, they were the ones that are pushing me into doing it. Mostly because of my sister. She knows how to manipulate people to the point they would lock me inside my room. She keeps tormenting me for her own amusement. I tried going out to avoid it but then my mom, dad and sister would get mad and scold me for being a ""prodigal son"". Anyways, my last straw is when I couldn't even finish my chores because my sister keeps intervening with me. She loves it when I get annoyed and torment me whenever I do chores. I tried talking to her but she then said that I'm useless around the house. She then took the hangers I was using for my washed clothes.

I told her that her words and her actions against me makes me wanna kms. She said ""so?"" With a sarcastic voice and a laugh. I threw water in her because her main purpose in there is to torture me. After that, I attempted to do it in the same night. I was only able to swallow a few meds and she got mad at me for locking the door and how she can't grab any food in the fridge. My mom got very mad too for taking my sister's money to buy the medicines and my sister wants to go to the police station and report it to the police because I took her money. 

Anyways, days after the incident... they kept pushing me into doing it still. I need your help and I really appreciate it. For now, I keep thinking how useless I am and all I can do is screw up. "
"I just ruined everything. She doesn't want to do anything with me. I scared the love of my life off. I've asked her, if I could fix it somehow and I apparently can't. I've ruined it all. 

I want to kill myself. I want to grab a knife and stab myself in the heart. Just slice it all open, making me bleed and feel something. I don't deserve this fate, but it seems like I deserved it. 
I want this to stop. I want this to end...

**Edit: Thank you all for your kind words and wishes. I talked with an adult I deeply trust about this entire situation and I'm feeling more stable than before. I'm giving her time, but I'm not getting my hopes up either. If she wants to talk about it - cool. If she doesn't want to talk to me ever again - then that's just the way it is.

And I'm also trying my best to not focus my entire existence on a single person in my life. My emotions are strong and real and not getting the same feelings back sucks. But I have to live with my mistakes that I made and learn from them.

Thank y'all. I have restored my hope back and wish you all a good day, evening or night.**"
"Whenever I'm happy or on the rare occasions I feel a sense of hope about my life, I dial it down a bit. I'm scared of being afraid to die. I FEAR fearing death. When your suicidal, you feel like ""Fuck it, let's get it over with"". 

But when I'm happy, it's like ""Maybe I don't wanna die. Maybe I don't want this to end."" Then the anxiety kicks in and I'm overthinking about all the things that could kill me. 

I guess being suicidal is a comfort. It's like i've been sad for so long that I don't wanna be happy. I often downplay my achievements or happy moments in my life. I always think ""Yeah, I'm happy now but later something bad is gonna happen"" It's like I equate everything. 

If I'm happy = bad shit is gonna happen. If I'm sad = good stuff is gonna happen. 

  
I don't really know what I'm saying. Can anyone relate?"
"Kids?  

You want me to subject another human being to this agony?

You want me to leave behind a single mother?

"I just turned 20 and I want to kill myself, Ive nothing in life, grown up being bullied even as an adult I cant stand my ground, my single mother has tortured me whole myself both verbally and physically, all my life I told myself ""I'm a man"" and men deal with it, until I find out im not completly a man aswell, Ive genetic condition known as klienfelter syndrome which make your appearance feminine because one extra chromosone, and it also creates mental challenges, this life is not for me, this world is not for me, Maybe If I was a healthy good looking individual I might have found some way, I cant even treat my conditon due to living in a shit hole 3rd world country with no medical assistance and broke as fuck as Im, Idk man idk, i just don't know "
"Seriously, it's insane how much the human body can take. Sometimes people die from the dumbest accidents or survive the most horrifying methods of suicide and fuck up their body for the rest of their lives, that's what is holding me back, it's a huge risk and there is almost no 100% success rate (except maybe a shotgun to the head?). It's really unfair tbh :( i wish i could, y'know, not exist anymore"
"My girlfriend and i have been in an ldr for about 6 months now. I love her with all my heart. She has had an extremely traumatic childhood: absent parents, abusive relatives, SA, toxic relationships and a lot worse. She told me she has always struggled with suicidal thoughts. When we met she had almost decided to do it. She was fine for a while but now shes telling me that its gotten worse. She gets sad randomly and she pushes me away. She writes letters to her family in case she decides to do it. I think she has written some for me as well. Today she was crying on the phone with me. She didn't wanna talk about it. I'm scared. I can't lose her. Idk what to do I need help please help me

Edit: when we woke up today we talked about it a little and shes feeling better now. Her suicidal thoughts are always there but sometimes when it gets really bad is when its scary. I'm trying to talk to her about seeking professional help but so far shes hell bent on refusing. In the meantime I'm gonna do everything i can to support her. Thank you everyone for your advice."
"I have been suicidal since a few years ago. No one ever know it. I just pretend that I am happy , live a normal life and go to school everyday. My parents never know about it. After taking exam tomorrow. I will kill myself."
"(I'm M 29)

I recently thought about going homeless because going to work everyday makes me feel like a zombie and I am depressed by it. I work and work to have a few weeks of every year, it sucks.

""But it's just how it is. We all have to work"".

Well... how about going homeless? Try to have a small income somehow and then live in a car for example. I'm desperate for alternatives because I hate the regular 9 to 5 life and it makes me concider suicide.

Thoughts?"
"fucking hell the amount of people I've seen on the internet mock Liam Payne's death has me in disbelief.

"It's been a year now. A year since he took away the last thing I had, my innocence. I was such a dumbass. There was so many signs...Yet I've let it happen. It started with a kiss on the forehead. His beard was stinging me.
Then a kiss on the cheek, one on the mouth... His hand on my inner thighs, his mouth still on mine, his tongue looking for entrance...
I remember it so vividly, it truly was a nightmare...But I never woke up. 

I was 13 at the time. It was in August 2023, one month before my birthday.
He stole my first time, my soul.
I took 3 showers that night, but his hands were printed on me, and still are.
The simple smell of bear can take me back to hell. I wanna feel clean again. I want to be able to shower without sobbing at the sight of my own body.

It hurts knowing that the only person who ever loved me, and who ever will, is an old man. 
No one around me takes me seriously.
But truly, something inside me died that day, and I'll never have it back."

I’m 21f and it’s come to the point where I’m deeply suicidal and would let anyone have their way with me. I feel like that’s what people really want any way. I’m so jealous of people who haven’t been exposed to the brutal side of sex early on the way I have. I have obsessively watched porn since I was 10 and started getting naked on Omegle in early middle school. I was severely bullied for shit out of my control. I happened to be an indian girl who looked different than so many kids in my school. Everyone else seemed to just understand socializing and looking presentable. I got diagnosed with adhd later on but even after the diagnosis no one gave me grace besides getting a few extra accommodations which were fairly useless. Anything I could chalk up to my adhd was seen as an excuse and I have had friends and bosses get angry at me making me walk away from them and never turn back. I will get therapy soon but with what I’ve seen suicide feels like it’s going to happen naturally and I might check myself into a mental hospital because this shit is taking up my mind every minute of the day. 
"I'm too tired to go on. Life's too painful. I don't feel anything anymore. My life's nothing but booze and slicing my wrist. I have no clue what else to say. I poured my heart out here so many times, just to be ignored. This is fucking pointless."

"I’m (17f) I have BPD and trauma complex . Everyone has ruined my life I can’t deal with this pain anymore. I have no one and everything it’s so painful . I was abused severely in my childhood and now I’m dealing with this pain . Why? Because those bad people has been mean to me and now I’m going to take my own life . No one gives a f about me and everyone hates me and abandoned me so yea no more future for me, everything will be gone for good . I will finally end this pain that has ruined me and prevent me from functioning. My happiness is gone too. Today will finally be the day that I’m going.

"I (29M) found myself home alone for a brief moment yesterday. Normally the house is filled with my family, but they all worked later than I did. I took advantage of the opportunity and made my way to the gun closet. I grabbed a shotgun and put the barrel in my mouth. It wasn't loaded, but the feeling was euphoric. Putting my finger on the trigger gave me a sense of peace and control I have never felt before. 

I looked at everyone's schedules and circles the next day everyone is working late on my calendar. I'm going to do it again, but loaded this time. 

I have a ""good"" life. High enough self esteem. People who love me. But life is hard. Every time you tackle one problem life gives you two more. I've realized this is just the normal human experience and that is depressing. We spend our lives for the benefit of others with only brief, fleeting moments where we can do what we actually want to do. I know those who love me will be devastated. I know how much I mean to them. But I still can't do this. I still just want to sleep forever. 

EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words. The last few days have been so stressful. I've checked my calendar and selected a date. I'm taking the next two months to get my ducks in a row. Writing letters, consolidating debt to get my co-signers off my accounts, and saying my last goodbyes. My time is nearing its end and I have never felt so at peace. If there is an afterlife I hope to see you all there someday, worry free and unburdened. "
"It's Halloween and seeing the kids having fun outside made me remembewhen my life was happier, all I want to do is kill myself over my past horrendous decisions that have screwed up my life. Wish I had an aneurysm and died. Hope you are all doing better than me, no one should feel this way. "

To my best friend, u are my brother, u got so close to me to the point where I consider u my family, everytime I hang out with u we do nothing but laugh, it’s funny really how ur the one who always suspected this and got worried, I love you.

These are the 2 most important people to me, anyway, I’m starting to feel nauseous, I guess this is it for me, bye everyone"
"I made a post earlier with a majority of my suicide note, but I just had a new thought.

Why is it so unbearably hard to kill myself? Why is fentanyl prescribed only, why does Tylenol ONLY cause liver failure and nothing else? What over-the-counter meds can actually kill you, why is it so hard to buy a gun, why does jumping in front of a car only sometimes kill you?! 

I don't want this to be difficult. I am so sick of things being difficult, I don't want to be tired anymore I just want all this shit to end."
I within my whole heart and soul know that I am supposed to end my life early. No matter what I do I cannot make life work for me. I feel cursed. 
"Everything about me is unacceptable. I am ugly. I've never had a serious relationship or even sex. I'm weak minded. I'm mentally ill. I'm never going to be normal. I'm 24 fucking years old and I've never been loved. It shows. Every day I grow less connected with humanity, as I miss out on the physical and emotional intimacy that others get to have. I am full of hate for myself. I am fundamentally and irreparably broken. I'll never be loved, I'll never have a family. What can I ever have? I just want to go back to binge drinking and drinking myself to sleep every night. At least then I never thought about how alone I was. I could be happier, but I'll never be happy. Life will never be good. What's the point of living? What do I have to look forward to? 

The only hope I have is that there is an afterlife and that God will cure me when I die. Even if there is nothing though, it has to be better than this. I think I might jump off a bridge. There's one that goes over an interstate. Lots of 18 wheelers. I could jump down and end it all. I really want to. If life is just a nightmare, then living even one more day seems like an awful idea."
"Why do people hate us so much?? We aren’t forcing anyone to join us or anything. I’m drunk as fuck rn and I have 900mgs of diphenhydramine (Benadryl / Nytol) stashed away in my room.

Maybe if I killed myself I could be reincarnated as a skinny non disabled non mentally ill cis boy?? I’m sick of everything. I’ve taken 3 grams of DPH this week total. I’m sure I’m so so sure 900mgs will kill me now if combined with alcohol. They’re both nervous system depressants; combined they enhance the effects of each other. I’m so tired.

I don't know why I couldn't help my Thoughts out of it When I stole it..... But please help me be a Good man
Stupid fucking survival instinct programming. Why does pain have to hurt so bad. I wish I could just die by fading into non existence instead of deliberately planning out a way to effectively die without it hurting too bad or possibly not killing me. I pray that euthanasia is legalized so I can escape this hellhole of an existence without feeling pain. Fuck me and fuck my life.
"You would assume based on my previous posts that I've hit rock bottom and that life could really only go up from here, right? Nope.

To catch you guys up on what has happened the past month since my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/s/3hfFIGC50W), here: 

So not even a whole month after me and my gf broke up she got a new boyfriend so that's fantastic; everything she ever said to me was a lie, I wasted four months of my life, along with thousands of dollars on her, and she proved every bit of my overthinking right. Yay.

A week or so later I flew out to Chicago pursuing a job opportunity in sales that I learned of from one of the people who left comments on my previous posts. Chicago is 1,000 miles away from my home state and it was the first time ever leaving my state or flying on a plane since my family has always been too poor to travel. It was awesome. I was meant to stay for about 2 weeks but I cut my stay short to just 1 because you can't really do well in sales unless you can act happy-go-lucky, and that is surprisingly difficult to do when you were staring down the barrel of your revolver just 2 weeks ago. I chose to come back home to pursue therapy, medication, and to be around friends and family in this time of recovery. At the time of writing this though, I have failed to obtain any of those or a new job. The only thing noteworthy was me getting a membership at my local gym week ago, which I've already missed two days of since I have been unmotivated to do almost anything at this point.  

Now that we're caught up, here's what happened in the past two nights:

Last night I was out at the gym for ~2 hours give or take, and I brought my friends back with me into my house so we could chill and watch a movie or whatever. Upon opening the front door into my livingroom with my friends in tow, I am greeted by my mother sitting on the recliner with eyes full of tears. She sees my friends behind me and just says, ""No.""  So my friends and I back-pedal out the doorway, I walk them out to their cars and tell them I'll talk to them later, and then I come back in to ask my mother what happened. 

Apparently not even 10 minutes before I got home my father punched my mother in the head multiple times. And she wasn't lying either, she had a knot on her head to prove it. I asked her what caused him to do this to her, and she told me it was because she woke him up to ask for his assistance with our central A/C unit in our house, since it's an old piece of shit that breaks almost yearly and costs our family a fortune to repair. Keep in mind when reading the next few sentences that my father has a natural testosterone deficiency and he is prescribed a monthly testosterone shot, which I do not know the exact dosage of but my mother complains often that the dosage is too high, and combined with his already very short temper it's not a great combo.

My father gets up to go see what is wrong with the A/C, tinkers with it for a bit and starts getting pissed off, while my mother is telling him to leave it alone and offering to call a repairman the next day since this was happening at night in an attempt to calm him down. Upon hearing this, my father punches her in the head ~five times. 

I didn't know what the hell to say. Sure they've argued throughout my whole childhood and sure my mom has told me that he's abused her physically and mentally in the past but i guess I just got used to it, accepted it as normal for them to do, so i always just kind of dismissed it...but now that there was proof that it actually happened and my mother was sitting in front of me with tears in her eyes telling me all of it in great detail, I didn't know how to react. 

She slept in my room last night and then shit hit the fan a few hours ago.

About 3 hours after my father comes home from work, I hear a scream come from their room followed by my mother running to my room, with my father speedwalking behind her. I get between them and they're both in my room talking,  with me standing between them. My mother calls her father and one of her friends from work to come get her and my little brother (13). She says that she's leaving and that it's over multiple times to my father, while my father tells her multiple times that ""if you leave you ain't coming back."" My father does his best to impede her from being able to leave, taking their joint debit card, taking her car keys since the car is technically in his name, (even though she's the one that dumped thousands into it trying to get it fixed due to it being a shitbox) and trying to take her phone from her since that's technically in his name too.

Throughout my whole life while watching them two argue, I always did my best to stay as the neutral party but tonight I just couldn't do it. My father made a lunge at her to take ""his"" phone from her. They got into a struggle and I came behind my father and pulled him off of her by his neck. He didn't try to hit me, surprisingly. My mother ran outside and Asshole and I followed her out. I stood between them again while my father begged her not to leave. My mom, fed up with putting up with his bs for 20+ years said fuck no, it's over. My grandpa and my mother's work friend both arrive to help load her and my little brother's shit into their vehicles. Did I mention that my ""father"" also wouldn't let my mother take any clothes with her since those were also technically for him since he bought them? 

My mom didn't feel safe going back inside past him to grab any of her clothes and we all got into a screaming match outside while her friend and my grandpa watched. Seeing as tensions were obviously rising, my mom's friend then called the police. We were all inside when the police knocked and then they watched on as my mom grabbed her clothes, and they then escorted her and my brother out and then they left for my mom's friend's house. I am still here at our house, alone with Asshole and my dogs. I do not feel safe, and while I'm typing this I'm sitting in my room with my shotgun loaded in case he pulls something. During the whole argument I kept a knife on me too. 

I do not know what the hell I'm going to do, at all. I've got a friend who is living by himself in his own house, but I can't stay there for all that long since he can barely even support himself right now either, I'm scared for my dogs because my father is a very, very petty man and he's liable to shoot them just to be evil to us, and I've got no place for them to go. I've got only 300$ saved for myself, no job of my own still, and there's no places around me hiring. I figure it's only a matter of time before Asshole kicks me to the curb since his parents did it to him at 18 too so that somehow justifies him doing the same to me. This is honestly the absolute worst my life has ever been, and it's probably going to get even worse. I almost feel like walking into Asshole's room with my shotgun to shoot the both of us so we can't hurt anyone else anymore. I am on my knees right now and I haven't a clue of what in fuck's name to do next.

"I swear that every time I’ve mentioned being suicidal, or that I have ridiculously poor mental health, people try to bomb me with compliments in some way like it’s going to change anything. First of all, Compliments have to be about something that is true. Second, complimenting doesn’t work if my brain isn’t even up to responding to negative stimuli. So what’s the point?"
"
You don't know my life, what gives you the right to say everythings gets better? It just sounds condescending and shitty to me. Its like they're saying it out of pity. ""What a poor guy, he cant even shower and cuts himself! Aw shucks""

People only say that to make me feel better, some genuinely have good intentions, but the rest are condescending pricks who hide under a mask. I want the truth, not some sugarcoated ""get better soon!"" Bs. They just pity and look down on you, everyone does deep down.

People are only nice to me because its forced. They're only nice to me because its their job to, there are other people nearby, weve known each other for so long, or just don't want to appear rude. But i know in their mind they know just how shitty i am. They just don't say it infront of my face, in their head or with friends.

Hope someone feels the same"
"I don’t see a future for me in this world of anti trans laws. And there’s so many people out there who dislike transgender people that I was even afraid to post this.

I really dont know im a very dumb person who cant do nothing. Its true im always behind people
"Hello all. I'm a 44 year old unemployed balding male virgin living with my aging parents with no career, marketable skills, or close friends. About a month ago I applied to be a manager at my retail job and was rejected, and feeling unappreciated, I decided to quit. My plan was to go back to school to earn a degree,  but at my age, it mostly feels pointless, as it could be 10 years before I accomplish that and work long enough to make decent money, and by that point the only women willing to sleep with me will be older, less attractive, and carrying kids/emotional baggage from prior relationships. I wanted to be a musician when I was younger, but didn't start playing an instrument until I was 20, and by the time I transferred to a 4 year college for music at the ripe old age of 25, I still wasn't good enough to hack it  in their program and had to drop out. 

I was bullied incessantly in middle school for having very large male breasts, which made me a social outcast and led to a severe lack of self-esteem, a distrust of others, and a fear of intimacy that has lasted to this day. I had gynecomastia surgery at age 29, but it was botched, and now I have small cavities below my pecs where my breast fat used to be. That and my wide, womanly hips (probably the result of a genetic defect that affected the functioning of my adrenal glands) are the reasons why I have always hated the way my body looks, and leads to my reluctance to push for sex with a woman. 

Right around the time I quit I found myself very attracted to a much younger coworker (20), and mistakenly believed the attraction might be mutual. On our last day working together, I asked if she'd like to get lunch sometime, and while she initially said ""sure,"" she later didn't say goodbye to me when it came time for her to leave. I texted her two weeks later to ask how she was, but she ghosted me. This was the latest in a series of rejections I have experienced over the years, it seems every girl I'm attracted to can sense my inexperience, hang-ups about sex, and neediness (given prolonged enough exposure to me), and it turns them off in a big way. 

I am almost as afraid of them saying yes to a date with me, anticipating their crestfallen expression if I ever got far enough to eventually reveal my strange naked body to them, wracked with guilt at tricking them into the situation, and imagining that they might traumatically leave me right then and there because it isn't what they were expecting. Even if they were able to overlook all that and actually allow me to finally do the deed, if they/I don't enjoy it, I will feel pathetic for disappointing someone who was willing to accept me as I was, and if it's great, then I will probably become very emotional realizing how many opportunities I've wasted throughout the years, which will also make things especially awkward.

I've never kissed a girl, never been lovingly touched by a woman or touched her back, never felt cared for and appreciated by a woman I found attractive. Sure, I could lower my standards and sleep with someone just to get it out of the way, but it wouldn't feel special, and besides, I feel that casual sex is somewhat irresponsible and can lead to unintended consequences with serious pitfalls. Why should I have to lower my standards where others don't anyway? It's not my fault, after all, that I was born with a genetic error that I can do little about.

Every day I wake up with no enthusiasm about the coming day, feeling alienated and isolated and apathetic about going through the motions of a life devoid of excitement. I wish I were brave enough to end it, there's nothing worth hoping for anymore, no goal I can strive for that has any hope of redeeming what increasingly feels like a wasted life. I hope some kind of afterlife exists once I pass, because if this is all there is, I've already blown all my best chances to make it something worthwhile."
"I don't know how to deal with people leaving my life, The problem is that this is ""part of life"", but that doesn't change the fact that I struggle with this idea every day, I suffer from thinking that one day everyone will leave my life, everyone I care about (which isn't many).

People usually respond by saying ""oh, you're going to meet new people"", but day by day, it's been more and more difficult to connect with new people, all my life I looked for people who looked minimally different from what I see every day, most people to me seem to act the same way, they post the same type of things, they even dress in similar ways, sometimes it seems like I see the same people in different bodies.

Currently, I only talk frequently to two of my friends, the others just don't talk to me anymore, they've basically disappeared, and this morning, one of the friends I frequently talk to, He moved to another city, yesterday I went to his birthday party and it was probably the last time I saw him in person.

You might think, because I talk to him mostly online and rarely in person, that there's no problem, but the question is, until when? until when he disappears like the others? until he has some kind of problem with his phone and changes his cell phone number?Deep down we all know that The phrase ""don't worry, I will always be with you"" is nothing more than a lying trap.

""Oh, you have a family, they care about you"" 
I swear one of the things I wanted was to have this attachment to family that people have ""Oh, I love my mother, I love my father, they are everything to me and I would do anything for them"" but I don't have that, both my mother (who doesn't live with me) and my father, are like mere acquaintances, I've heard my dad say he wishes he could connect with me (he didn't say it to me, but I heard it) but I just can't.

My family also has the problem that most people have, they insist on defining things as a mere question of 8 or 80, You have a problem? simply resolve it! Do you have a barrier? just break it down, as if it were a simple matter, people can't seem to see things in a deeper way, but I don't blame them, they have their own problems to solve, and whether they like it or not, they would never be able to understand, and even if they did, what would they do?I don't think words are able to save me in any way, they don't change how I feel, all that could save me is some kind of miracle or divine intervention, but obviously nothing of this exists, otherwise my pleas would have been heard and I would have died in my sleep, but no, I go to sleep crying and wake up crying.

I've been increasingly afraid of dying alone, I know it's happening, I know everything is falling apart, and I think that contrary to what I think, it's not the people, it's me , there is something very wrong with me, there is a monster, a demon inside me that is devouring me and I simply can't take it anymore, I don't know how much longer I can fight against all this, when you fight for a long time , eventually you get tired, and that's why we lose. 

I wish for death but I am also afraid of dying,
I know that nothing awaits me on the other side and that I would simply cease to exist, and that scares me, but I'm afraid of being alone too, all these worlds of contradictions hurt me, I know that everything is part of life, I know it's part of life that people move away, but that's what bothers me, I don't know what to do anymore, I've become more and more reclusive and I've been scared about my future, I deeply curse the day when that I understood the nature of things."
"I want to sleep in my dreams forever. 

My reality is too soul breaking. "
"I’m tired of living for others. “It will get better.” It’s true. Some people get better. But some don’t. I don’t think I’m getting better anytime soon. Don’t try talking me out of it. There’s nothing but other people I’m living for. I know I’ll be called selfish but I don’t care anymore. I’m tired of being forced to live. I’m not living for myself, not my future, not my happiness, but for others. And I’m sick of it."
"14, just in short I got molested by my step-father. No one in the family believed me, refused to get me help. Mom lashed out at me for framing her husband and threatened to disown me. This wasn't the first time and I'm tired of these bullshit, mom even said she won't give two shits if I killed myself. So I thought why not, since that's literally the last fucking option.

In the next 5 days, I'll plan out my suicide and see if I'll change my mind or not. Though I don't want to kill myself in public so I won't jump off a random building, I'll use my pocket money and buy a shit ton of pills to shove down my throat."
"I want to die but I feel like commiting suicide would be so pathetic. I don't want people around me to think I am pathetic. I hope everyday that I could just push someone put of harm way and die like in some movies. Then, it would be a heroic death. Accidental death also sound good. Like I trip into the water and drown. I can't swim anyway and I drown like a few months ago in a waterpark. The lifeguard safe me tho. It would make sense for me die drowning but it would be werid for me to go near water. People who know me know I only go out for necessities. I wish I just get three wish like from Aladdin. I can wish for a painless death then."
Thirty years of suffering is long enough. I have no friends. I’ve never been in a relationship. I’m not close to my family. I hate my job. Everyday I wake up in the morning wanting to die. When I ask what I have to live for I can think of nothing.  My gift to myself is the thing I’ve always wanted my whole life: death. It’s enough time to start giving away my things and tidying up my life. I can find a way to kill myself that will traumatize people as little as possible.  I am tired of being a burden in everyone’s life.
"Honestly, is there a cure?"
"I’m a 36 year old man going through a divorce. I have moved away to try and rebuild myself and I’ve only made things worse. I have really poor social skills and thought moving to a bigger city would help that but it’s Friday night and all I can think about is how everyone else is out having fun and with a partner and having sex. I have a shit swing shift job and live with my uncle. I drive hours every other weekend to get my daughter. I feel like a failure as a man, partner, and father. I’m spiraling in my head, can barely get my ass out of bed, and if I didn’t have a daughter I’d probably be dead. Everything is so daunting I feel hopeless. My life is a waking nightmare. So fing lonely. Can’t even enjoy the time I have with my daughter as I have to go to my moms boyfriends house. It’s pathetic. Can’t even go to most meetups because I work in the evenings. I’m pretty decent looking and in fair shape but my odds of finding a woman interested in me and my dumpster fire of a life feels pretty low. The amount of depression and anxiety I have is basically crippling let alone what I need to do to dig out. I know I should exercise. Eat well. Just get out and DO things. I’m trying to get a therapist. Have tried antidepressants. Every day I waste in bed the worse it gets. I dread the day and the night. Have no idea who I am because I hid from the world for so long. Trying some meetup groups this weekend. Hopefully I go. Gotta crawl before you can walk I guess. Self esteem is zilch and can barely think in a conversation. I’m so boring I just smile and say superficial stuff. How did it come to this. Feel like it’s over for me."
"I’m 31. I’ve been a nurse my entire adult life and given my all to this career, which in return gives me nothing but stress and hopelessness. I am basically broke, more so than ever before. I have almost zero dollars. This job, despite being so senior and relatively “high up the ladder” doesn’t give me enough of an income to survive in this day and age. I will probably never be able to afford a home or my own, or to ever have children and a family. I will probably never get married. I have done all the therapy in the world and tried my very best to make a life for myself. I’m very educated with multiple degrees. I make all the “right” life decisions. Yet it doesn’t get me anywhere. I was born into poverty, and despite my very best efforts (and capitalism), I will probably die in poverty. I cannot see the point of doing any of this anymore. I’m going to slave away for the rest of my life, and for what? Nothing. I’m going nowhere. It’s taking my very best efforts to not jump from the balcony where I’m on now. This world is inherently corrupt and evil anyway. There is no point for any of this. Tell me why I should go on, because I can’t think of one single reason. "
"I've been homeless before and it sucks. I've lived in my car and it sucks. I've lived with a long time friend who ended up almost killing me (very abusive/unstable). I'm in my early 20's and I lost my whole family 3 years ago, but things in my life have been untstable since I was young. Lost my mom to cancer, my brother to drugs, and my father disappeared. I went back to college, dropped out, went back again, dropped out, and I'm back again. The jobs I did when I was not in school were absolutely terrible, but all I had access to. I am trying my best but failing. It's too much pressure. I'm too tired all of the time. I have no one to run to. I'd much rather be dead than be homeless again. I don't think I can finish school and that limits my job options. I'd rather be dead than do customer service, warehouse work, sex work, etc. again. Everything is too much and I can't catch a break and I'm too fucked up to maintain healthy relationships. I can't take a break and I can't keep going. 

Thank you for reading. Fuck this world. I think I will go home to my mother tonight. I love and miss her and cannot take the pain of living on my own anymore. Sure she'd be disappointed in me for giving up, but at least we can chill out in the after life with no pain or suffering. "
"I feel like the worst daughter in the world right now. my mum found my suicide note and read it the whole way through. there was a lot of very sensitive information on there. she thought I was dead and I had left it for her to find, and had to call up my work to check I was alive. 

safe to say I'm in a lot of distress right now. I have no idea how I was stupid enough to leave it somewhere she could find. I feel so guilty. Her reaction has made me even more scared to follow through with it, which I'm sure if I were rational right now I'd see as a good thing. 

I don't know what to do or who to tell. I don't want to tell a friend about this because I don't think anyone would want to be friends with a suicidal person. being suicidal is so so lonely "
"I’m destined for suicide. One day, I’ll kill myself. I’m a lost cause. I’m beyond helping. It’s over for me. I’ve accepted my fate. It’s all that I think about. If this was the happiest day of my life and you gave me a choice between existence and nonexistence, I would choose the latter in a heartbeat. I’m not meant for this world. I hate having a body. I long for freedom. If could spend my days just listening to music I’d be content, but instead I must work to fill someone else’s pockets. When I confide these thoughts with those closest to me, they respond with the same useless platitudes. I don’t blame them. I don’t think any words could soothe my existential dread. I don’t know when, but I’ve decided I’m leaving this world by my own hand. This knowledge has given me a strange amount of comfort. An eerie sense of calm has washed over me. I no longer worry about the future because I know how things will end. "
"i turned 18 a few months ago and tbh i don’t think life is really headed anywhere, since i turned 18 i haven’t been able to find a stable job in my area ( most of them are fully staffed or not part time and i’m in high school ) i’ve lost around 30 pounds ( went from 155 to 120 ) my parents say that they don’t have to feed me and i understand that so i usually just go to sleep hungry, i have no car due to the fact that i have no job. i honestly don’t think my life is going anywhere from this place im in now and i don’t want to be hungry all the time and so poor to the point i can’t even buy some fries at wendys or smt. i can’t do this anymore, i give up."
"Is anyone here religious and wants to die/kill themselves, but can't bring themselves to do it bc they're scared to meet their maker like that and/or scared that they'll go to hell? If so what's your religion and what's your thought process on that?"
"I after years of not opening up, opened up about my suicidal thoughts and when I got close to attempting recently. Immediately sent to psych ward, I feel so betrayed. I was scared of this for years and never talked to anyone IRL, I finally do it and I get sent to a fucking looney bin by a bitch who doesn't understand me AT ALL. I am gonna come out a worse person than when I came in, and I think I will actually end it for real as soon as I get out. The thought that finally opening up to someone punishes me so hard hurts so badly. I really don't think I can take it, I never felt so hurt and betrayed in my life before. I wasn't at a suicide risk, I was actually stable, I was finally stabilizing and this is what I get. I am going to end it when I get out. Fuck her.




Edit: I managed to avoid a psych ward, my family insisted on keeping me. Thank God... this still hurts really badly."
"Im from Florida and as you may know hurricane Milton is approaching, I dont care what happens anymore, my life ended long ago. That's why im staying to die here in Tampa.
I alredy wrote my name with a sharpie but I dont think anyone will care about claiming my body once the hurricane goes away.
Thanks for everything tho, this sub was my main source of help for years.
I will be here until I run out of data or my phone dies."

God I’m tired why do i have to be trapped in this place i feel so stuck why can’t i just stop breathing why my prayers are not answered i pray to die everyday i want to be dead i just want that 
"Sometimes I would see stuff and take it as a sign that something it's telling me to kill myself. I don't know if this is some sort of mental problem (besides depression, of course) or what. 

Something like: ""oh, my cat run away, this is probably a punishment for not killing myself and a sign that I should do it or something worse is gonna happen""."
"I've been thinking of suicide for a few years now (41m). Divorced in 2019, lost everything. The outlook for the future is bleek. Dead end jobs, no college education. Good at some things,but master of nothing when it comes to making money and employment. 

I come from poverty. My first childhood home didn't have running water. Raised on a tiny aboriginal community in Manitoba. Work ethic was instilled in me early on. That's prettymuch all I have to offer. 

I moved to the closest city at 18. Got a good job, and  learned how to support myself. Met my ex wife a couple of years later. We got pregnant young, too young. We struggled but we we're making it happen. Bought a house, moved into a better job. Got pregnant again. Everything seemed and felt as it should. 

As time went on, like any young couple we ran into problems. Problems that we're never dealt with properly. As the years went on, those problems started to fester and creep their way into our lives. I left my plant job to pursue my dream in a trade. That was a mistake. I took a huge paycut in doing so. At the same time she was doing her studies online and earning a degree. I bounced from job to job looking to get back to making more money,  while her career took off in social work. 

Once she got her masters, she was making enough money to support herself and the kids. In 2019, we got divorced. I was not in a good position for this. I had been working on the road and was laid off. When I got back I was out of the house 2 weeks later. No job, limited in funds. In less than 2 months she had someone else moved in. A rich banker. His office in the bank and her office for social work were literally 50 yards apart. 

We lived in the same town for a couple years of 13000 people. It was hard for me seeing my family around town with him. That's were the initial suicidal thought really started. 

They then moved to BC, the most expensive place in Canada in 2022. To be honest, when we were still together that was the plan for us to move there. Either way she got what she wanted. 

With that, I never saw my sons for an entire year. People have said I shouldn't have let her get away with that, but my sons wanted out of Portage. I didn't want to hold them back. I saved up for a year, sold things off and moved to BC in April 2023. I found a decent job and lived in my car for a couple of months till I got a summer rental. But I didn't care, I was close to my sons and that's all that mattered. As long as I found a permanent place before winter. In the okanogan that's easier said than done. I didn't find a place and ended up having to move 9 hours away to Edmonton to live with my brother. It was only supposed to be for the winter. That brings me to the present. Still in Edmonton, which I hate. Still away from my sons which kills me. 

I've felt alone in the past. But I was always able to put it aside. That is no longer an option. Me and my brother are not that close. The house is a disaster. Overrun with pets, piss and shit everywhere. I've lived in basements for 3 of the last 5 years. I feel bunkered in.

Suicide is an idea I've played with in the past but I'm not playing anymore. Living on hope has run its course. Now I'm fighting to survive my own thought every day. This morning I woke up lonely and depressed only to see on the news as soon as I tuned it on that a pga tour golfer left a tournament early and killed himself. That flipped the switch. I'm ready to do it now. THEIRS NO REASON TO GO ON ANYMORE! Everyone takes the woman's side even if shes a cheating whore. Her friends, my friends, our friends. I think I can hold on till after Fathers Day. I don't want to put my dad though that, or my sons. But after June 16th I will be going forward with it. Im not proud to admit I'm this weak, but it's the truth. 

Thanks for listening reddit....the only ones that will.

"why can’t i have enough money to enjoy my life? 

working retail has made me realize how wretched humanity truly is… and what do i get for enduring it all?… pennies. 

after the work day, what motivation do i have for anything besides sleeping. i have no time for relationships, hobbies, or anything meaningful. 

the idea of working the rest of my life away is the most genuinely terrifying thing. 

it’s like darwinian economics where the rich prosper, and the rest of us are just priced out of life.

"I am a 43 year old man who is homeless and living in his car. I had a horrible mental health breakdown last year and lost my housing, employment, and friends. Now I just drift day to day, sitting by myself and staring out of my car window. 

I have no children, no wife/lover, no friends, and no one to talk to or be around. My head injury which caused my depression/OCD/ADHD has robbed me of any quality of life. I used to be somewhat popular and had a decentish life, but my mental health robbed me of any ability to hold onto that small, yet good, existence. 

I’m just so fucking lonely and sad now. I sit in my car and stare out the window. I go days on end without eating. I tried to get into a group living situation a week ago, but I didn’t get voted in. 

I just want to die and see what comes next. If it’s nothing? That’s fine. Better than suffering. 

Like most of us, I’m not sure if I want to “die”, I just want this life to end. I’d give anything for a week in a motel and some tasty food &amp; company. 

*******EDIT*******

AHHHH! SO FRUSTRATED!! 

I keep trying to post in r/assistance but I don’t meet all their criteria. I just want to get a motel room for a night or two. There’s supposed to be a really bad storm today where I am and I don’t want to be in my car if I can help it. 

This sucks so bad. Lol, my life is just shit now."
"26, girl, from Italy, living in Berlin.
I don't have friends, hobbies, nothing excites me anymore and i would just like to jump off something very tall. I don't have talents and I'm not special and I will never be. I am not cool enough for someone to like me. I do nothing all day except for work. I am ugly af. Every choice I made in my life was a mistake. I just wish I had the damn courage to k*ll myself already. I try to dress cute and everything but I am just not good enough even to put outfits together, I will never be enough and I can't stand it anymore. I am tired of this boring and sad life. I don't even harm myself in any ways cause I hate pain, I am just a coward in the end. I wish I was dead by some natural causes since I can't do it myself. 
Idk maybe a brain injury, a bus hitting me, a fatal accident of some sort, I even wish I had c4ncer so I knew I would die soon. I just want to end it all but don't have the courage. I am sitting on the couch trying to not think about it but I cant help it, nothing distracts me from the feeling. I tried eating, watching a movie, colouring a stupid picture, reading, I can't sleep and I don't have anyone to go out with. I am not creative, talented or good enough to make something good out of these feelings so I just thought I posted on here, knowing nobody will even read or comment. My opinion doesn't matter to anyone, not even to strangers on the internet.
Hopefully I will be brave enough to do it someday, wish me luck."
I keep seeing people on Twitter talk about how they want us dead. My own family is transphobic. I told my parents that them misgendering me made me want to die. They didn't change their behavior at all. I told my own parents that they were making me want to die and they didn't care. I keep hearing about laws conservatives want to pass. It all makes me want to die. There are so many people that want us all dead just for existing. It's fucking exhausting. I just saw a post about how Ghana made it illegal to be queer and all the top replies were celebrating it. I can hear my dad's computer and he's listening to conservative bullshit as I'm typing this. I just can't take it anymore. I just want to die so badly. 
"I'm doing better. The depression has been subsiding. Things don't feel so dark anymore. I'm happier.

But I enjoy being suicidal and sad. I want to get so low that I finally commit. I like falling down and not being receptive to help. I want to go back to how I was feeling when things were bad. I miss something about the feeling of being on the verge of suicide.

Anyone relate?"
"i just wanna earn a lot of money and do something i love. i don't like anything that could get me a (high paying) job unfortunately. i'm so jealous of everyone who can just buy what they want, travel to where they want and get all of that while having a job/passion they can perform to get the money to do all of that. i'd seriously rather die than just have ""a job"" with ""a decent salary"" my entire life, please get me out of this system. perhaps my parents having lived their entire lives like that makes me scared to waste mine away as well.

i know there's people who have it worse than me financially (especially a lot of americans, thankfully i was born in europe), and i respect and recognize that, but this is just how i feel. "
"I'm ashamed to confess my weakness, but I can't control it.

I am suicidal since I don't even know when, it all started with depression, and depression started with other mental illness. It's never ending battle.

Lately I fantasize about suicide daily, and pressing the gun against my heart felt really good.

100 meters away from my home is a river. Luckily nobody goes there in the winter and it's in the woods.

 So my plan is to go to the river at around 2am and shoot myself right in the heart. I will die and river will take my body, the same river that watched me grow when I was a child. 

It's been a long time since I've fantasized about it and I think it's time."
i’ve had suicidal thoughts for a while now since i was 12. due to my high school final exams i want to kill my self. i mean it’s not like im dumb or i do bad in most of my subjects but its just that math tests always get me. my parents have a such a high expectations when it comes to my math marks and i try to keep up with it. it’s not even like im not trying i do try this is the hardest i’ve ever studied for a test but i still end up getting a mark my parents will never be satisfied with. with my mid year report my math mark was really bad i passed but it was bad. math is the only subject that makes me feel like im dumb especially since everyone around me i see is doing better than me. my mom lashed out on me and she said words i thought she’d never say to me which made me have a mental breakdown when i was alone. i’ve never wanted to kill myself so badly now i think ill do it with the end of school so at the end of the week. im planning on taking out the baldes in a sharpener and slitting my wrists or using locking my door and hanging myself with a belt. i don’t know what to do. someone help me please.
"I’ve been going to hell the last 3 years because I can’t handle life anymore. I’m autistic and literally cannot survive in this society without being abused and isolated by others. I have many many traumas I’v lost weight. Going through a huge depression I lost everything my job friends etc 
I can barely take care of my self. I told my friends about my suicidal thoughts for weeks now and about going to a psych ward. My friends don’t care about me I haven’t been able to leave the house for 2 weeks and no one asked me if I needed anything of If I was good. Yesterday they came outside my home to have chat and smoke some js. They sat and talked about their parties and after without even asking once how i’m a feeling today making sure i’m feeling better. Then they come to me saying oh sorry I wasn’t here then proceed to do nothing nor think of me etc

I’m just so broken and tired and upset. Idk what to do anymore. I don’t want to live through the embarassment of going to hospital and I have marks around my neck now from the noose. I don’t want to tell people what I tried to do. I just want to go to sleep forever. "
"I dunno i hate this shitty life i feel like a massive tramp i didn't see myself in this position a few years ago but here we are.

Super depressing sitting in a dark house with bad weather i just want fun but that won't be happening."
When am only enough to decide life isn’t for me. I hate all the “you have your whole life ahead of you” 60 more years sounds awful. I think 60 more seconds sounds nice.

Fucking overpriced US expensive shit

Therapists arent even transparent anymore. I went to a therapist office through my local Children's Hospital and then we got the bill a couple days later. Fucking 400 dollars for one single visit. 

In the past 10 years, I have been to around 20 diffirent ones, therapy for me just dosent work, but my conservative, ultra-religious parents are against meds for some reason

I sturggle with OCD, Social anxiety, my body constantly shaking cause of a medical problem, and depression caused by my ugliness. And with the therapist when i brought up how i people made fun of me cause im ugly, just like everybody else ive ever talked to, she said ""oh well i dont see anything wrong with your appearance""

I even go to a christian school. Fuck that. Fucking religious pricks are the worst. Delusioned asses... The people of 'the religion of love' have been treating me like shit since I was like 7. 

Therapy wont fix me. Drugs could i think. Unfortuantely theyre also expensive as fuck and im still 17 so i cant even get anything perscribed.

Drinking, when my parents are gone and im alone at home sometimes helps, although Ive only done this a couple times

Worst fucking year of my life already. I dont know how i can make it to december (when I turn 18)"
I took about 7 hydros and 5 promethazine pills. Should I go to the hospital or I’m okay? This isn’t a cry for attention it’s just a person with regret seeking help. 
"I don’t know how to describe it, it feels like such a staple of how life is lived by people other than the ultra wealthy involves being just disrespected and treated as an accessory to someone else or a business/employer. I have a lot of personal baggage that influences this of course but it just feels exhausting waking up and doing my best to stay calm and get thru everyday when I know the vast majority of people I interact with see me as my job at best and a complete joke at worst. Any time I snap even to the slightest extent feels like a crime against humanity,, life puts you into a monotonous routine that barely gives you enough to get by and then turns on you for even getting the slightest bit frustrated. Anyone else get this?"
"nothing about my life feels real, i don't feel a deep connection to people- not in a sociopathic way, i used to. just not anymore. nothing here feels real, it feels like at any moment everything would zoom out and the credits scene for a video game would play, and that would be it. i'm not a good person and i hate myself, but the months of overwhelming guilt and self hatred now feel alleviated thanks to coming to terms with death. i know ill die, so it won't matter and i wont have to burden anyone anymore, not that they're real anyway. the only thing stopping me from doing it now is my siblings and my parents, because if they happen to be real, the pain ill cause them is too much to think of. idk what to do, i just don't want to stay alive. don't tell me it gets better, i know it does, but it's not about that."
"I have the pills underneath my pillows. I have done my research. I have a total of 38'500mg of it. I'm am just so lost. I'm just so depressed it hurts... And its weird I'm Even writing this because no one will care. I will always say ""my life is a comedy""...

I love them all but I just can't wait to meet one of my sister in heaven(i f that's where I go) I have about 3 friends, I'm on my way to a therapist I've been waiting for 8-9 months now, I have attempted 4 times about to attempt (and hopefully succeed) all by pills, the worst thing the pills have done to me was make me throw up and Hallucinate, I'm sorry for anyone wondering or worried about me but u all dont know me, I only made the post to Signify that I have given up for my family if there yk ever read this lol. But I'm A nobody, I can't go anywhere without feeling my Sexual assaulter's hands on me. I hate my teacher. I hate my life. I've been suicidal for 3 YEARS! So for anyone saying ""just wait a little longer"" I HAVE and I'm not trying to be rude but it hasn't worked for me. It never has, never will. I'm still planning on doing it tonight, bit if I dont ig ill keep u posted (only if anyone requests)"
"For context, I'm a 16yo female and there is no sexual implication.  
  
My mother got a notification from my school today in which it stated that I failed my HASS exam. She was very angry at me for this, and she told me some very explicit phrases which should not be told to one's own child. Regardless, she told me that I'm not 'allowed' to sleep 'alone' in my bedroom anymore. She told me that because I failed, I don't deserve the privilege or sleeping by myself in my bedroom, and that I have to start sleeping with her, in her bed ,every single night, at whatever time she chooses to go to sleep.  
  
Only until one year ago was I actually allowed to sleep alone, and that was after me begging her for months. She takes away my phone every night, and now she's asking me to sleep with her?  
  
All she does is berate me about something she doesn't think I've done right, and lecture me whenever she sees me.  
  
For the past few days she's been trying to get me to sleep with her in her bedroom, and I've just been saying 'no'. Now she has an excuse as to why I should sleep with her, because I failed an exam. I'm not even taking any subjects relating to HASS next year, so the grade of this exam is worthless to me.  
  
I struggle with sleeping, I find myself staying awake for hours after I get into bed, and when I do sleep I end up waking 20-40 minutes later because I experience sleep paralysis and false awakening loops. Because of this my school performance has decreased severely, and I've even told my mother. She thinks I'm lying, because whenever she comes to 'check on me at night', i'd be fast asleep. I was never asleep. I can always feel her lingering at my door, she even makes me sleep with my fucking door open because she doesn't 'trust' me. I always act as if I am asleep whenever she does this, because if I'm not she suspects that I'm doing something 'inappropriate' or that i'm hiding something from her, which makes her get angry.  
  
And now it's back to square one. I have to fucking sleep in the same bed as her. I can't even cry, I can't do shit. My time constraints regarding my schedule all have to adapt to this because she always sleeps at 8. I cannot fall asleep so early, it's annoying because I have to lay there like an idiot.  
  
I don't know what to do, I'm just overwhelmed and I don't know how to express myself.

She always tells me to kill myself as well, and I am so sick of it. I don't want to be bound to her like this. I don't know what to do. I would rather die than sleep with her."
"I've been everything I could, I knew it wasn't enough. I'm going to be homeless, have no car. This life my mine has been a joke. I couldn't find peace in this life. I'll find it in the next. "
I am suicidal and been this way for a long time now but it seems to be hard to do. I read and hear people killing themselves and I want the same but just don't know how. 
"I made my post about an hour ago saying that I didn’t have anything to live for anymore. After I posted it, I went and read post after post on this subreddit of people feeling the exact same as me. For whatever crazy reason it may be it felt comforting (I’m not remotely sure that that’s the right word) to know that I’m not alone, and I feel like I need to be there for all these random people that I don’t know anything about other than they are like me. What a weird mix of emotions, but I’m safe for at least another day."
"I’m 26F I’ve felt like this since I was 13??- I don’t take any medication as it’s side effects usually outweigh the good :(.

I’m still expected to have dinner cooked and the apartment cleaned and our cat taken to the vet and back by 6pm even though I’m almost 8 months pregnant.

I suspect my fiancé is cheating on me- he works in a banking company, he’s supposed to get off at 6:30pm from 9am- at the latest but he usually comes back 2 hours late.

I just wish I wasn’t a woman, I’m going through all of this pregnancy stuff alone, I never wanted kids but he kept convincing me that hed be here to support me during it.

And he’s gone.

I’m literally giving up hope on men, they do suck :|

I don’t even want this child he does- I’m treated like nothing but a sex object and something to carry his child, what’s new for woman.

My whole life is ruined now because of him, my body is ruined for good- my social life is ruined, everything is ruined

"Suicide is selfish. Is there some other way to sacrifice yourself that is noble? Volunteer for risky medical research, be a part of a military suicide mission, or any other selfless method of dying?"
"Ive just taken 2 packs of paracetamol and crushed them into orange juice and drank it and the moment I did I regretted it what do I do.

I don't want to go to the hospital because they scare me. Please help. 

Update: Taking the bus to the hospital, phone calls scare me 

Update 2: Arrived at the hospital, getting help and not gonna die! :D"
"Everything is just self imposed rules and constructs that create society along with everything fucked and negative in the world. Everything feels like I game, I rly wanna just kill myself and end it at this point cuz I don't see any point in even trying to keep going. Apparently suicide is bad, but the way I see it that's just another rule or construct created by those who actually enjoy this fucked up game, and I don't, I just wanna stop playing. Is it rly that wrong of me to want to stop living cuz nothing is currently working out, and nothing will ever work out for me."
"hello, im 15f and want to end my life soon. i failed my gf for a start and my parents aren’t very proud of me because im a failure. i dont wanna be here anymore because i cant do anything right. i also dont have a purpose. im sorry everyone that im here…genuinely…im really sorry. i promise you i will try to leave when i can."
"UPDATE: SHE HAS BEEN FOUND!!! AND IS SAFE NOW ❤️

Hello. My best friend is in South Korea and she is standing by the edge of the Han river bridge, very famous for suicide incidents. Her last post was the shot of the river! 
I am trying to reach out to her friends in South Korea once I get their contacts. I am in Japan, and if possible I can even fly to South Korea but it will take time. So I will try to reach people who physically can help her.
I am so desperate. Please give me moral support. As a fellow extremely suicidal person myself, I know the lengths people can go to harm themselves.
I am in tears. Please God, don't let her take her life away."
"I’m sitting here now having my last beer and last smoke, I’m sorry to this world for putting so much negativity into it and then dipping out like a pussy when things got hard to my friends and family thank you for doing so much to keep me around for so long. In a few minutes I’m going to shoot myself with my shotgun so I don’t fuck this up too and burden everyone even more."
"I'm just tired of the world, loneliness, diseases, the worthlessness of existence and the fact that I'll never have a girlfriend."
"no life skills and everyone who talks to me realizes eventually that im fucking autistic. i also always offend people on accident, not by being mean but by the way that i move my hands when i talk and the way my eyes shift in conversation (things i dont even understand the purpose of). i cant do this anymore. and im fat and ugly (everyone tells me this). i hate myself so much. i just hate myself so so much. i cant do this. theres nothing left for me. ill never be anything.

Today is my birthday and I am alone. Everyone abandoned me. No One wished me hbd. Just fuck you all. I hate all of you. I hope I will be dead soon
"I keep seeing people talking about suicide awareness and trying to convince people to not take their own lives but why does it matter? If I don’t die now I’ll have to go through 60+ years of pain on a daily basis, I don’t get why people value being alive so much

I’m lonely af, have no friends, I’m pyroluric and have no will to live. How could being alive possibly be better than being dead? "
"I gave away my earbuds to a coworker and I’m giving all of my games to my brother and all of my other personal stuff is going to my sisters clothes shoes stuff like that. I already have a plan. A place. Just need a day. Do I want to make it to 30? Longer? I don’t know yet, but when it happens they will be happy. 

Edit: thank you guys everyone of you for letting me feel heard and vent on here you are all angels 😇 I might have worded it weird I’m not 30 yet I’m only 26 I still have a few years to go its mostly just a debate I have with myself and sorry for not commenting sooner I work night shift so I sleep all day and I just now woke up

"Ill try to tell all of this as fast as i can. I (20f) have been depressed most of my life due to the constant psychological abuse i received from my family (divorced parents, depressed mother, ausent father, problematic older brother) 

Worked hard and left home to study in another city at 15 and even tho i was always financially dependent of my mother i was happy in the sense i didnt have to see my family as much, even if i was still dealing with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts

At 16 i had a suicide attempt and ended up in the hospital, my mother was called as i was a minor and got put in psychiatric medication for the first time. My mother is mentally ill and hated the fact that i had medication so ended up taking it away from me without my or my doctors consent after some months

Since then, i knew i couldnt trust her for anything and continued being the perfect daughter (good grades, unproblematic) while studying away from home and dealing with my mental illness all alone

This year 2024 my mental health has rapidly declined and ended up going to the er for suicidal ideation 9 times total (3 of them for overdosing on my meds) and got put in a suicide prevention program. My mother didnt know any of this until on my third overdose in less than a month i got put in the psych ward and everything got uncovered

In her first visits to the psych ward all she did was scream at me and make me feel guilty and the nurses had to tell her to leave, and even though i told my psychiatrist everyday i wouldnt be able to live with her they wont allow me to live alone anymore and im now stuck in my house again

My mother wont let me have any freedom at all, cant see my friends, cant see my boyfriend as theyre all in the city. Im just stuck with her all day and if she sees me being sad shell just yell at me and make me feel guilty for not being ok

Only way i have to go back to my old life is by getting better and get off my meds but theres just no way i can do that while being here stuck and isolated i just dont know what to do and feel even more suicidal now than before. I even still have to go to the city to study and waste 3h everyday on transport

Just writing this to let it out dont know if someone will even read it i just feel so alone and ignored by my boyfriend and family and dont wanna bother my friends as everyone has better things to do than dealing with my shit life"
"Look in Albany news, you will see a car wreck into the side of a bridge tonight. Feels good to say something. I’ll see you soon hunter"
"I've made too many bad choices in life, Im 20 and i've set myself up poorly. I won't be able to live a good life. I think I need to die, too many of my bad choices are irreversible.

This terrifies me, I've not felt like this in a very long time but I honestly don't see another way out. The actual act itself is way too scary rn, but im fearful that I'm gonna end up doing it out of desperation."
