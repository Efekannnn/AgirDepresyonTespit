"Just fucking kill me. Shoot me. I wish I could go to bed and not fucking wake up anymore. I'm so tired. I'm so fucking tired of all the pain and suffering and I can't fucking escape it. Just take a knife and stab me to death already. Let me leave this place

Edit: I fell asleep shortly after making this post, and unfortunately I woke up. I ended up self harming, and I just feel worse. Some of you are very nonchalant about encouraging me to end it... but I am a coward. I can't even self harm enough to bleed all that much. I'm a total wimp. Literally not strong enough to do it of my own accord.

I could sit here and ramble about my fucking woes and horrible life circumstances, but I'm just... tired. Tired of explaining myself, tired of trying, tired of feeling like my heart is being ripped out of me.

To those of you who actually said something nice... thanks, but I've heard it all before. ""It could be worse"", ""I care about you"", ""It gets better""... It doesn't feel like it. Every time I end up feeling ""better"" my depression comes back worse and worse sooner or later. The self harming gets worse The thoughts of ending it all persist.

So.. what I'm trying to say is... I'm unfortunately still alive, and I still wish I wasn't.

Edit 2: I am alive. I've been on meds and I'm in therapy, but I'm looking into intensive outpatient care and will switch therapists once the evaluations I wanted to get done are done. I'm still holding on, somehow. Lots of you have helped. I still wish I didn't have so much pain and anxiety and sadness in my brain and body, but... some of you have inspired me to do something I hope will mean something to you. What that thing is, I'm not entirely sure yet, but it feels good to know people out here might actually want to see it.

Thanks."
And felt like that is the most apt description I've ever heard of what it feels like do you agree?
"This has destroyed me. I‚Äôve always thought maybe ‚Äúseverely depressed‚Äù like I‚Äôve always been told on tests and stuff was extreme. Like, surely I‚Äôm at most moderately, maybe just a little depressed, like everyone is, right?

But what the fuck? People get out of bed excited for the day? I thought hobbies were just finding a way to pass the time with something atleast somewhat bearable. I can‚Äôt believe people enjoy stuff.

Like, it sounds like people live their day to day life like I spend a night drunk."
"Is there anyone else in their 30‚Äôs who have been mentally unwell their whole life and have no job, resume, partner, kids, money, essentially dropped out of society and dependent on others to even drive places? Bonus points if your interests are ‚Äòyoung‚Äô ie anime, gaming, clinging to things from your childhood like Harry Potter and 90‚Äôs cartoons?

I really struggle to accept myself. Anxiety and OCD robbed me of hitting any adult milestones and I fear nobody my age will ever relate to me and I‚Äôm so sick of therapists trying to be a cheerleader and telling me how much I have to offer when I objectively don‚Äôt have anything to offer, cannot function and don‚Äôt even feel my age"
"Well, we try to. And guess what? No one cares. Everyone is busy with their own lives and problems. They don't want to hear about how you're severely depressed and think about killing yourself every day. It makes them uncomfortable. So in your hopes to receive some sort of support or connection, you just end up pushing people away, which makes you even more isolated and depressed. That is all. "
"I am quiet quitting life and nobody realizes that‚Äôs what it is. My friends think I‚Äôm just being a bad friend. My family just thinks I‚Äôm being a bad family member. I don‚Äôt want to die but I don‚Äôt want to live in the world any more. I just want to go to work and then come home and that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt want to go have dinner with people anymore. I don‚Äôt want to hang out and be made to feel obligated to stay until 11 pm before I can go home.  Nobody realizes that this is my way letting go of life, of escaping from the world.  I‚Äôm alone, I‚Äôm 30 years old and haven‚Äôt had an intimate partner for a decade. I love those in my life tremendously. But I just want to let go. When I‚Äôm home, I‚Äôm free to be who I want. To feel how I want, to look how I want. I can say what I want, my cat doesn‚Äôt mind. He doesn‚Äôt judge. He looks up to me and needs me and he‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs warm in my bed.  There‚Äôs nothing more signif√≠cate to write here. Just thank you for listening. "
"Came out looking like fucking megamind. Some babies get the umbilical cord wrapped around their neck on the exit, not me. I was clutching that motherfucker with all the newborn baby strength I had, completely blue according to my parents, but the determination to not come here was STRONG. The joke ive been running with is that I saw a peek into what my life would be and realized I had to do everything I could to stop it from happening. 

I was almost the second miscarriage, so fucking close boysü•≤ Now im stuck with all you beautiful assholes and my relationships tether me to the flesh prison. I knew what was up when i was being born, i knew that was my shot, n i blew it"
"I‚Äôm fucking disgusting. I have to shower with the lights off so I don‚Äôt have to look at my embarrassing body. Whenever I go into the bathroom I avoid looking into the mirror so I don‚Äôt vomit in my mouth. I‚Äôm so fucking hideous. I‚Äôm a monster. I‚Äôm short and unattractive and nothing will ever change that. I have no sense of a personality, I‚Äôm socially awkward, and have failed in every aspect of life. I have nothing going for me and never will. There is no part of me that is worth liking.

I will never get to experience how it feels to fall in love. I will never get to experience the touch of another person. I will never get to experience romance of any kind. I don‚Äôt deserve it anyway. I wish the world would kill me so no one ever has to look at me ever again."
"I'm 20 Female from the Philippines.
My Cousin attempted to raped me last month.
My Dad knew about it and kick him out of the house, But now my cousin is back and welcomed by my Dad with open arms.

They expect me to just forget about what happened just get on with life.

I can't sleep, I can barely eat, past rape trauma flooding my mind like a storm. How can I forget, how can I forget that easily when everyday I feel scared and disgusted about myself.

My Dad doesn't really care about me, He doesn't gave me allowance or support me in school. Can't even buy me clothes or other things I need all are hand me downs.

My phone recently broke it's a hand me down from my aunt 4 yrs ago, I tried to get it fixed but I was told by the technician that it's better the I buy a new one.

Asked my Dad if he could buy me one he scolded telling me how clumsy I am, ungrateful and doesn't settle on what was given to me, he even goes on to hit me.

I suffered a black eye but other than bruises I'm good. 

I'm doing my best to get to college and get a scholarship but with recent events it's getting harder and harder I can barely catch up with my online studies, because I need to ration the remaining allowance I have from being a part time Make up artist. And also I'm dealing with my trauma, depression and Anxiety.

I'm really really tired. I'm gonna be ending my life tonight when they go on vacation I will be left alone to watch over the house, so it's the perfect time. Thank you for reading my post and I hope you guys will have a good life than me. Bye.

Update:
Hello everyone. I don't know if everybody will receive a notification about this but I decided to not do it, A very kind person made me think otherwise. I promise to finish my studies and be a teacher and help children in need. It may not be now but someday I will pay all your kindness forward, Thank you so much for giving me these kind words to keep going. I love y'all!"
"

just as it states. im currently on my flat's rooftop, with pills in my hand. getting ready to say my goodbyes. i dont know why im writing this. maybe deep down i would like to be saved by someone. 

sorry

update: thank you all for your kind comments. i'm safe now. my dad has found me and stopped me in time. tomorrow im going to the hospital to get checked."
"I work out and I see zero benefits when it comes to my depression. If anything, working out makes me feel more exhausted and drained. I dread working out, but I still do it because I love being firm and toned, but no matter what type of exercise I do, my depression doesn't go away. AT ALL. 

I am angry at people who claim that depression can be cured with exercise. That is NOT real depression"
"I'm in therapy, I'm taking medications and I still think almost daily about suicide. Nothing makes me feel happy and my life feels meaningless.I made friends because I thought beign lonely made me suicidal, I made plans for the future so I can have something to look forward to, I clean my room and go outside because it's good for me but nothing is ever enough. I asked my therapist why he wants to be alive, but nothing he told me seemed so fulfilling that it makes sense to keep going. I don't understand why most people don't want to die when life objectively sucks so much"
"24F here. My life‚Äôs a depressing toxic dump and I‚Äôm lonely as hell. Sex is my only escape from this dumpster fire. Angry? Horny.numb? Horny. Sad? Horny. Busy? Horny , tired ? Horny. or just plain fed up? My room is my happy place because nothing else gives me that feels. 
Deleted social media to ‚Äòfocus on myself lol‚Äô but now all I do is think about sex  Feels good for a sec, then I‚Äôm just hollow. Am I broken or just craving love? This messed-up coping thing is starting to seem like my only option. 
And honestly im so over it lifes a mess . Lost my passion for gaming and all the fun stuff i used to do - so depressed bored and horny . Nothing really matters anymore "
"I went to check on my mother today when I thought she was taking a nap, to shockingly find she had passed away in her sleep. I completely relied on her to live. She was my everything. I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for her. I have no way of supporting or taking care of myself. I am riddled with suicidal thoughts and depression and she worked hard my entire life to support and take care of me. I have no job, I'll lose the house we rent, I can't afford anything myself. She did everything for me. I dont even know how to make a doctors appointment myself. I don't know what to do. I've always told myself that when she dies I'll just kill myself and thats all I can think of right now. My entire family was here all day and I had to pretend that I'll be okay, but I know I wont. Once everyone left I completely broke. I don't know what to do."
"I (34f) literally have not left my bed in a month other than to go to the bathroom or get food from the kitchen. I order groceries from Instacart and shop on amazon if I need something. I haven‚Äôt showered (I hate the idea of water touching my body) but I have done basic hygiene daily.
I don‚Äôt sleep all day, in fact I‚Äôm usually up by 8, but I‚Äôll spend my days reading(multiple books a day) , or watching tv on my iPad. 
I avoid calls and texts as much as I can, I just have no desire to interact, but I do respond occasionally.
I‚Äôm unemployed and live alone so I have no need to go anywhere or talk to someone during the day.
I have ADHD, depression, anxiety, OCD, excoriation (skin picking) and I take meds daily.

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm looking for help and advice or if I just needed to share with someone what I‚Äôm going through. But if anyone has advice, tips to help motivate me or even gone through something similar themselves, I would love to know. (Please be kind)"
"Nobody admits it but it's true. ""*Time heals all wounds*"". Year after year you just get numb, it gets easier to muster but its different. I have improved, become more numb to all of it. There's no hope with this sickness."
"I can‚Äôt even believe that this is it. My heart is pumping through my ears, it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm nervous but I‚Äôm ready. Me and my long term relationship broke up because I‚Äôm a toxic piece of shit and he would genuinely rather be dead than listen to what I have to say anymore. All my hobbies are dead, I have no friends, I hate school, and I don‚Äôt think I was supposed to be alive this long anyway.

I almost feel guilty, like I‚Äôm doing this for attention or something. Nobody is going to know, at least not for a couple days. I‚Äôm home alone, so it‚Äôs the perfect opportunity to do so without thinking about the consequences. My plan is to lay on the couch and hopefully OD while I‚Äôm sleeping so that whoever walks in (probably my older sister) doesn‚Äôt have to deal with the trauma of gore. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have a brain bleed or something going on in my skull from a nasty fall I took, so if that OD doesn‚Äôt work hopefully I just succumb to my injuries. I stole my mom‚Äôs opioids from her back injury a while ago and have been hiding them in the back of my closet.

I‚Äôm leaving my dog a lot of food and water just incase and a note saying that my mom can have him. He‚Äôd be happier with her anyway.

I just can‚Äôt believe this is my last day. I wish I would have done things differently. I wish I would have went to the mall one last time, or maybe the movies or something. I wish I would have gone to see my sister, and my mom, and tell my highschool bestfriend how much I miss her. I want my second oldest sister to know how much she ruined me as a person, and that this is 100000% her fault. I wish I got to eat my favorite food and watch my favorite TV show one last time. God, I wish I could convey to my dog how much I love him. I wish he could know that if I wanted my last breaths on earth to be with anyone, I would want it to be with him by my side. That I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm so selfish that I won‚Äôt be there by his side when it‚Äôs time to experience his.

No more fuck ups, no more being miserable and pathetic and a joke. No more never shutting up and making people hate the sound of my voice. No more not being pretty enough, or skinny enough, or sexy enough, or smart enough. Just eternal peace. I‚Äôm nervous but it‚Äôs time and it‚Äôs been time for a while.

Good luck to you, Reddit."
Yeah I‚Äôm done. She told me to go get help and figure it out myself. No real compassion at all from her at all. I really hate being a man. I know what I must do now. 
"I‚Äôve been depressed for a majority of my life now. I‚Äôve figured out how to manage and function despite wanting to just quit. 
On rare occasions I end up going to bed and just forgetting about it all to get away from responsibilities despite the consequences. 
I‚Äôm still alive. 
Whenever I vent my frustrations I‚Äôm told ‚Äúthat‚Äôs life‚Äù which to me sounds like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù 
Or that I‚Äôm too negative and that this is just a stage and things will get better. Or to change my perspective.
None of these have worked cause at the end of the day I‚Äôm still facing the same bullshit that is my life and struggling to catch a break. I work from the moment the sun comes up all the way into the night. School hasn‚Äôt done anything for me or propelled me forward in life. 

That‚Äôs life but I‚Äôm supposed to pretend it‚Äôs ok when I‚Äôm clearly not ok?? I‚Äôm stuck in this stupid cycle hoping something will come around just to be denied something good because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs life and the time will come eventually.‚Äù Eventually as in probably not within my life time. I feel so hopeless and it‚Äôs ridiculous to subject myself to these thoughts. I haven‚Äôt had a moment where I can just be without the day having the be in preparations for work and school. 

Recently I‚Äôve gotten a haircut which completely destroyed my self image. I‚Äôm such an idiot because I did it out of impulse and imagined that it would look good on me. 
I feel like people are lying when they say it looks good because I end up having to explain the whole reasoning behind cutting my hair with some made up bullshit like ‚Äúit was damaged and extremely unhealthy‚Äù then they give me unsolicited advice on what I should‚Äôve done with my hair. That just confirms they were lying because if it was truly fine then there shouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúwhat I should‚Äôve done instead.‚Äù 
I don‚Äôt want to go out any more or show my face to anyone that may know me because I already had this same stupid conversation about my new hair so many times as work already and a few acquaintances who clearly don‚Äôt look at me the same way anymore cause I look ugly now. 
I just wanted to look good for once but did something stupid. 
I don‚Äôt like looking at my reflection and I wake up disappointed because I look different and happier in my dreams. 

God. This sucks so much. I feel so alone and trapped. Don‚Äôt even want to go outside and my self esteem is in the basement under bedrock. So fucking stupid "
"My friend who has severe depression has been ignoring my messages for half a year. I sent him messages about once or twice per month. Sometimes I asked him if he is feeling OK, sometimes I shared the funny picture of my pet. I also shared with him some news that he might be interested in. I also told him it is OK if he just doesn't want to reply, I will be here whenever he wants to talk or needs any help. However, he never replied. Last month, I went to his city and asked him if he wants to hang out and he still didn't reply. I know he is alive but just didn't reply my messages. Is this really because of depression or he just don't want to be my friend anymore? Did I do anything wrong?"
"I think I'm gonna end it all in an hour or so. I already wrote a latter to all my friends and family, I think I'm actually gonna do it instead of going at work. I'm scared of failing to do so.

edit: I am still here, I actually was planning on doing it on my way to work, but while talking about it with some of you I got to work without doing it and I'm feeling better.
I will seek help and try to live longer, thanks to everyone, sorry for making you worry

edit 2: to anyone who thinks I did this for attention, I'm so sorry you think that, but I have friends and family, I just don't feel comfortable opening up about any of this with them, it's easier to do so here, even if it feels silly.

edit 3: thanks for all the kind comments, I read all of them, if I don't reply to some it's because I'm at work, but I see you all and I appreciate it a lot"
Nothing or anyone excites you anymore. Not one single person can turn you on. Music doesn‚Äôt mean anything at all. Food is all the same and places don‚Äôt make a difference. Too lazy to speak and too lazy to explain things. Your room starts to feel like a jail cell. You start to notice the same things happening over and over each year. Things will never be the same‚Ä¶ things will never change for you without some serious effort towards personal growth‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm starting to give up on standards and expectations. I‚Äôm just floating before I drown.
"Went to the dentist today for the normal checkup, I have 14 fucking cavities. I‚Äôm so tired of this shit. It‚Äôs so hard for me to take care of hygiene. Dental or not- i went all of last week without showering which I KNOW is disgusting. All I want to do is sleep, I‚Äôm tired of existing. I was sitting in the fucking dentist chair and going off about how I want to kill myself. People think I use depression as an excuse. I don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm literally having a breakdown rn."
"I actually feel like I'm going insane
Every single fucking day I lose more and more of myself. 

It's been 6 months since I lost the one I love

I've lost all my friends 

I have nothing

I feel dead and I'm not even dead 

I wish I died at birth 

I wish I was never born"
"In my case, it's been pointless. No one cares, or they're going through their own shit and don't have the capacity to take on my burdens mentally or emotionally. It may have actually hurt my relationships. I'm treated differently now, like I'm not cool anymore. I dropped the mask for a moment, and they learned more than they wanted to about me I guess.

I should have kept the mask on, saved up some money and went to a professional to start with."
"I've never been completely happy . From the time of consciousness, I've never been happy. As a matter of fact I've always been sad. Internally lonely. Delusioned. No mental peace. 

Each year as I got older, my depression would reach certain heights. Get more extreme. 

Around 19 years old, one morning, I woke up and decided I wanted to die. I chugged bunches of sleeping pills and some liquor I found in the kitchen cabinet. I then went back to sleep. I would've succeeded, honestly. My grandma and mom came back from the grocery store . My grandma had somehow made it into my room and accosted me into the bathroom tub . Threw me into some cold water. 

I threw up a bunch. That was the second time I had committed suicide. 

I'm 25 and it's not better. I have moments where I burst in tears. I also realized I'm truly alone. When you're a teenager, you attend school by force. You get to still have some interaction amongst people. Though when you get older, its not like that at all. You can go days and months without speaking to anyone and anyone speaking to you. People can ignore you. Not read your text. People can reject you. As you get older. So reaching out for help can absolutely be useless. 

I don't know what to think anymore. I don't know what to do. I'm kinda tired of it. Trying to find something to pull me out of my mental issues. They never last long. How can someone spend their entire life trying to convince themselves that they should keep living ? How do you convince someone of such a thing and continue to do it over and over and over again. Isn't it a tiresome thought. Who in all sanity should have to make themselves feel like life is worth it? 

That's a sick existence."
"Hi all so I switched anxiety meds a month back and dropped 40 pounds! Plus exercise I was really starting to gain body confidence.

Well im at work rn I've just been informed by a old coworker who really cares alot about me, older lady real sweet.that it's being spread around that I'm on crack now, and i shouldnt be doing that. I was like HUH!? I've confirmed with like 5 other ppl that this is what's being said about me..

I tried explaining best I could without giving away medical info cause I shouldn't need to and that i wasnt on drugs. But apparently folks that knew me when I was big have attributed my sudden weight loss to crack addiction and its spread around now..

Wtf man. Why are ppl like this, I got ppl that I've known since 9yo that recently ive noticed won't even come near me at work now (grocery store) and i find out its cause they think I'm some kinda tweaker now and that shit really hurts..

Has anyone else had this happen to them? And hope yall are having a better day than I am üôÇ"
"I am a 32yr old Korean dude, simply born due to my parents' selfishness to satisfy my dad's parents and to not to look as fallen behind within Korean society.

My mom married my dad to live better as her family was really poor. They had the first baby and it was a girl and my grandparents were not happy had as they needed a 'boy' to keep the bloodline and family going. So they had me 3yrs later.

Lol but guess what? That first girl, my older sis killed herself after severe depression throughout her life. And I am the only child now. The boy who was made due to necessity not because of love.

I don't even miss my sister that much to be honest. My family is just made as they needed one not they wanted it. Honestly I don't think there is 'love' in our family and look at the results - first girl died and the later boy is thinking about dying everyday.

I will never bring a child to this place solely because of my needs. Shame on you mom and dad honestly. You should have never ever met and bring me and my sis to this hell."
"I‚Äôm likely to be put in an inpatient ward next week but no one would expect it. I maintain my hygiene, I eat normally, and I hold down a 40hr a week in-office job. I have a roommate. By all accounts, I‚Äôm well adjusted and a ‚Äòfunctioning‚Äô member of society.

I‚Äôm so suicidal it‚Äôs crushing. I attempted to start therapy but have been told I am required to do a mental eval before they can consider me as I‚Äôm high risk, and they will be checking back into assure I do or I‚Äôll be involuntarily taken in. So‚Ä¶ yeah. It feels like everyone will say I‚Äôm faking it just because I can manage to do what‚Äôs expected rather than laying in bed and rotting (despite how badly I want to).

Anyone else deal with this? Or am I just fucked?"
"Life can be so unfair, many people use drugs recreationally but some people use it to coop w their miserable life's , when you grow up and spend decades of your life stuck in a life of hell, w screams and shouts and not being able to do nothing, even as hard as you try.... You need to find a way to escape when there's literally no way to escape, and th only way some some people is by using drugs... If you're a prisoner in your own house and you can't escape, how to you expect people to maintain some sanity? Only way is to use drugs in this case . If I can't physically leave the situation I'm in, at least my mind can, even if it's just for a few minutes"
"I have been fighting with depression since my childhood (my first thoughs about disappearing begun around 6-7 yo). And I have been suicidal since my 12yo. I tried so many things, at the beginning I thought I was just lazy, after a while I thought I was just strange and different, now I know it's depression, and I tried everything, from Catholicism to Buddhism, from drugs to lots of sports, from therapy to meds. I tried reading about, searching for something. Anything, that could explain why I can't be normal.
I at a low point again, and during all these years I always thought. ""It's okay, If it gets too much I can just go"". Thing is, it always is too much, I'm always stretched thin, I never had energy enough to finish anything, from college to any work project.
At this moment, while I write this, I'm still trying to find something, anything that would make this life worth it. I can't find it. I can't find it and it's just horrible. Because even so, even being a disgrace to my family, not being able to maintain any relationships, not being able to care for myself, behind dependent of my parents, not being able to be a normal, functional adult, I can't find courage enough to finish it.
I know, gods I know I should kill myself. Rationally thinking I know this won't end unless I do it. But I can't and it's like torture.
I'm so tired of existing."
"im 18. ive been doing this for years since i stopped going to school due to an incident. i know its unhealthy and i know it might kill me one day, but i cant stop.

im always too tired to leave bed, so i end up staying in bed for around 20 hours each day. i havent left my house in almost 2 weeks, and when i leave my bed its to play on my computer. i shower when i can. just the bare minimum of taking care of myself. i dont remember the last time i brushed my teeth, though. it was sometime this year.

i might die if i keep doing this, but it doesn't really bother me. its getting so boring.

edit: I've read nearly every single reply i got here. i never had people give me genuine advice like this. everyones telling me to brush my teeth, and i will. one of my biggest fears is my teeth falling out anyways. i don't have much energy to respond to everyone, its a little overwhelming to be honest. i just needed to vent, and ill take the advice i got here and I'll see if i can contact my doctor soon. ive been unmedicated since this january so i hope she gets back to me soon. for those asking what games I've been playing, its mostly been borderlands 2 and 3 with some portal 2 sprinkled in :)

again, thanks for the comments, who knew so many people related to my little problem"
"I am suffering too much to live, but loved just enough to stay. 

I dont know at this point, basically a ranting and yelling into the void. 

Probably no one would see this.

I just had a seizure caused from my anti depressants and anti psychotics. Bad day indeed. "
" been depressed ever since I can remember and it's only gotten worse with age. coming out of a bad break up ive come to realize how pointless life is. i have no hobbies, no passion, no friends, no energy to even exist. work and eating is a given but other than that I have no want or reason to get out of bed everyday. i just doom scroll on apps until it's time to sleep and then I rinse n repeat. 

im so tired of being alive, most days I wish I could just turn my brain off."
" My depression is because I fundamentally hate how the world works. I identify with my depressed qualities because it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever been and it‚Äôs all I know, that‚Äôs where all the profundity of character is and is what makes me me.

 Im attracted to people who are mentally healthy and caring but those people would be dragged down and exhausted by me and will cut me out of their life due to boundaries when I need them the most. The more suicidal and lonely you get, the closer to the truth of your reality that becomes. It spirals downward and all negative things attract to you and reaffirms your helplessness and all support systems will shut you down to preserve their own health. Fuc this place I want out 

 Nobody wants depressed people like you and me in their life, and not everyone has a mother figure that will stay with you through the thick of it, so if you can‚Äôt snap your fingers and poof it out of existence like Thanos himself than I guess we‚Äôre all hellbound "
"When my husband's asleep tonight, I'll take my life in the bathroom. I have to be at work by 6 am and I'm already marked for three tardies already and so close to losing my job because of it. It's my fault. Nobody cares about me. Nobody wants me around. I'm always yelled at.  I constantly let everyone down, I don't have friends. I'm just so tired. I fuck everything up. It's all my fault. I honestly can't wait to be free of this life.. I'm the problem. There's no changing my mind. We're running out of money and live in a tiny hotel room. Groceries are expensive.  I'm just so done. Nobody cares Nobody wants to help us. "
"I'm depressed and anxious constantly, I'm horribly agoraphobic meaning I don't and won't leave my house for weeks at a time, I can't IMAGINE holding down a job, just my whole life revolves around my depression. I will feel so horrible that I will just lay in bed all day and night sometimes because I have zero motivation to even get up or do anything. I can't survive with this, idk how others do it..."
"I tried to ignore politics for a few years but this year it just got too important. So many things are happening. Everyone treats each with so much cruelty. Countries killing innocent people, politicians taking rights away, making life so expensive for the majority of people as if you only deserve to live if you're lucky and rich. I feel like my depression and anxiety are completely due to the fact I notice all these atrocities, and since they're never-ending, so is my depression. Taking medicine can't help the world magically a better place. I just hate being here watching all of this happen, and just watching so many unregulated and mean people harming innocent people and animals and the environment. "
I think it‚Äôs a sign from god or the universe- I loaded the bullets in backwards. Its stuck. I‚Äôm too embarrassed to go to a gun shop and fix. Wow. I cannot believe it  
You see how depressed you look and when family show you pictures of your younger self it makes you feel terrible I used to be so happy 
Honestly I‚Äôm just ready to die. There‚Äôs no point of living when my soulmate is gone forever. I rot away in this bed everyday. Every morning I wake up dread weighs me down until it‚Äôs time to go to sleep again. What‚Äôs the point of living this miserable life. He died 1 month ago but I haven‚Äôt seen him in 7 because he was in the middle of deployment when he passed. So the next time I see my husband after 7 months he‚Äôll be in a casket‚Ä¶
"The gist of the matter is: I am depressed with no friends so I turned to excessive hentai to cope. Then it turned toxic and I'm a sex-obsessed perv in addition to my depression and socially-inept.

Don't misinterpret me, I wholeheartedly condone enjoying the pleasures of the flesh. I just wish that I found joy in literally anything else. I wish I had friends or hobbies or whatever, but I am too infatuated by the idea of fantasy. There's my rant, thank you for reading."
"i feel like im stupid or lost intelligence and depth ngl :( 

i can hardly focus on things anymore, even stuff i used to (and still do) love. i used to be able to read a whole book in one setting but i can hardly read a few pages or even finish an episode of a show now. ive tried to do these things but idk, it just doesn't work most of the time... even in a quiet environment i just cant focus on it. either i get distracted way too easily or im just reading and rereading words and not retaining any information. 

the only time i can actually sit down and focus is if ive procrastinated until the last minute and now have to rush to get stuff done. either that or im extremely interested in it and can binge it... i genuinely feel stupid üò≠ idk what to do. ive heard depression can give you brain fog so im just assuming its that... i miss my hobbies though..."
"I‚Äôm (29m) getting to the point where I‚Äôve googled the gun stores near me multiple times, looked through their 12-gauge collection online, and imagined myself driving there to purchase one. Unlike one of my countless impulsive food or beer trips, this destination will be the final one to numb the pain. Then I drive out to a field somewhere, put on my favorite song (Komm, Susser Tod) put the barrel in my mouth, and blow my brains out. 

My regrets are many, but chief among them are being found in such a state and the immense pain I would cause my family and few friends. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm necessarily beyond help, but the pain of sinking deeper into alcoholism and inability to provide for myself are becoming too much to bear. My parents now treat me like a dangerous time bomb with inflections of worry in their voice every time I go down the stairs from my childhood room. I feel like I don‚Äôt belong in this world anymore. "
"I finally caved. I was shaking going in to the store. As the guy was explaining guns to me at the counter- I just said it was for ‚Äúself protection.‚Äù I was shivering while talking but I played it off like I was cold. I put it on my credit card.

I have hid it in my room for now. I have my exit strategy. I was at an all time low yesterday, and I thought it would make me feel better to have a way out. 

I have recorded videos for my family, and written a note. I‚Äôm not sure when I will do it; but I really feel like I will. 

I just wanted to share. "
"I‚Äôm tired of people saying this to me. I‚Äôm tired of my therapist saying this to me because it fucking doesn‚Äôt.

College really kick started depression for me. I didn‚Äôt get on it or take it seriously in high school and let it fester, now I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôll be able to graduate before I kill myself. And I don‚Äôt have any support system, my friends look at me weirdly when I express anything other than my happy-jokey persona. My therapist and I don‚Äôt meet frequently enough to actually do something.

So no, it doesn‚Äôt get better. It‚Äôs been 3 years and not a damn thing has gotten better."
"My roommate ended up moving out today. Without any prior notice. She did it while i was napping and once I woke up she didnt speak to me about what was going on. She expressed that my depression amongst other things had made her feel uncomfortable in our shared space. Last semester I had a suicide attempt in our dorm and this semster I was drinking in the dorm and got in trouble for that. So I can see why she'd want to move out, but it rly fucking sucks knowing that my shitty mental health is affecting someone else's life. We were always just kind of 2 strangers living together but again it sucks knowing that I'm a problem person to be around."
"I was talking to a friend the other day and she kept going on about her future plans and how happy she is, I just thought wow some people genuinely enjoy their life, they don't *want* to die, they aren't looking for excuses to stay alive, they're just happy being alive"
"I've been depressed for 44 out of my 56 years.  I've been on at least six different types of SSRI.  I've  talked to therapists. 

Nothing works.   I sleep twenty-two hours out of every day.  Even now, sitting typing this, my body is saying, 'Go back to bed, man!'. 

Do I need to accept that this is it?  That I am never going to be well?  "
"She was so bubbly and running around bc it was busy, calling me sweetie and honey. I was kinda amazed at how happy someone could be working at a gas station. Keep in mind it was 9:30pm, but she gave me my card back and said, ‚ÄúI just have to ask, are you okay??‚Äù I was like oh shit, ‚Äúyeah I just got off work haha thank you!‚Äù ‚ÄúJust tired? Ok well have have a good night!‚Äù

During the ride home I was feeling such mixed emotions, feeling really heart warmed that someone cared like that while also wanting to die bc omfg I‚Äôm so embarrassed. I looked at myself in the mirror and tried to smile like I was doing before. I look so miserable, and I can‚Äôt even deny it bc I am miserable and trying to smile physically hurts at this point."
"I am 70 and want to die. My Social Security and savings won't keep me alive if I live too long and I'm so ashamed.

I am still working full-time but the pay is very bad and I'm too tired to keep on. If I weren't so old, I could get a job doing the same thing and be paid well, as I was in the past. I only have this job because it's remote and they don't know how old I am.

I lost my young adulthood to caring for my elderly parents without help and now I have no one to care for me.

I live in terror 24/7 and feel sick all the time.

I work alone in my apartment all day. I have no one to talk to or eat with except occasionally. I can't take it."
"It's like impostor syndrome, I feel my depression is fake because I never killed myself. It feels silly to talk about something for so long and never actually do it. I had planned to do it on my 20th birthday; I‚Äôm 21 now. It's like I have something to prove, like I‚Äôm not depressed enough to use the label. Like I‚Äôm all talk, and no action. Idk if any of you guys relate to this.

Edit: Wow this got a lot more responses than I was expecting. It's very overwhelming for me to try to read every single one and respond to it. Thank you to everyone who showed me support and empathy. To those wondering if I'm getting help, yes I am I have a support system, and have been getting treatment for some years now. And to the one guy who said I just need to toughen up and be more optimistic: fuck you, sincerely. "
"I‚Äôm 26 years old and I have lost 50k on gambling. I just got engaged in November and I‚Äôm going to tell her today that I have 5k left to my name. I‚Äôm going to inform her that I want to kill myself tomorrow. I‚Äôm a gym teacher at a school and it would take over a year to get that money back. I‚Äôve had bad depression my whole life and I today I realized that I have nothing left. I‚Äôve deleted all my gambling apps. I just don‚Äôt know what else I can do. If it goes bad then I will probably kill myself tomorrow morning. I‚Äôve tried to stop gambling and it‚Äôs been a couple of weeks since my last bet. I just don‚Äôt think I have a need to be on this earth any more.

Update:
Well I never expected so many people to read this. I‚Äôve talked to my fianc√© and my parents about this. This wasn‚Äôt just about the money, it was also about the trust I know that I lost. I‚Äôve lied to them for the past 6 months and that was the biggest thing that was eating me up. They were all supportive towards me and I am going to get some help. I really appreciate all of the positive posts and I understand some of the ugly posts as well. Suicide is selfish but it just felt like a better option than telling everyone about my problems. I am relieved that I got this off my chest and I‚Äôm now happy to get my life back on the right path!"
"I can barely understand things any more. I used to be really smart but I think I'm just so exhausted my brain can't comprehend things anymore. I don't know. 

Even shit like trying to fill out a form or make an appointment is just so difficult, it's like my eyes just float over the words without taking anything in. I can't read books anymore because I just zone out, I can hardly write, and I'm meant to start university soon and I've got no idea how I'm going to get through the workload. 

I just want to be like I used to again. I'm sick of my head being full of fog. "
"I'm sitting here depressed contemplating suicide (I won't because my dog needs me) but feeling sorry for myself nonetheless. My partner died unexpectedly just weeks ago. I have no one and nothing to live for and I don't like my job anymore. Yeah I know I'm a f'n crybaby whatever.

My neighbor doesn't work, doesn't pay their bills and is mooching off of me. My dumbass let them use my Wi-Fi. Not the first thing nor the first time. Yeah I know I'm a sucker.

I guess I'm just really pissed because I'm having a bad time and they are taking advantage, while blasting internet music from my Wi-Fi."
"Please, find a way to go on walks. Find a way to put a little bit of time towards learning something. Don't do nothing because it will compound. My brain feels atrophied. I'm clearly getting sick. Wounds aren't healing right. I have no job, no skills, nothing. I feel ashamed of my existence. Don't let this happen to you. You know which habits are good and which are bad. At the very least, pick up one good one and let your future self benefit from it."
"Everything is getting more and more expensive, basic necessities take almost all of my money and to make enough I have to work so much I have no life outside of it, why bother living like this"
"I‚Äôve been in a downward spiral for a few months but was treading water. The past few weeks have been really rough for me. I have never been as genuinely suicidal as I am right now. I‚Äôve always struggled with the motivation to get going and do things and be outgoing (I‚Äôm also just an introvert - social events usually drain me and that‚Äôs not a bad thing, it‚Äôs just who I am), but I don‚Äôt enjoy ANYTHING right now. When I go out and do things lately I just want to go back home and go back to sleep. 

Aside from just being an introvert naturally, I‚Äôm also dealing with a lot of social anxiety and pressure right now. It‚Äôs overwhelming feeling like everyone expects something from me but I feel like I can hardly take care of myself. I‚Äôve had some interpersonal issues lately that have been hard for me to process. I feel anxious and fearful in most social interactions lately. I just feel like a monster and like no one truly likes me. 

My boyfriend and I have a little bit of an emotional discussion about it, he tells me he‚Äôs here for me and that I‚Äôm important to him and everything. 

Two days later we have a FIGHT because he and a friend planned something and it was apparently not as optional as he made it seem to me. We went out the night before with a bunch of people he knows that I have never met before and we had also done something that morning.  I tell him to go without me. 

We then have an argument about how he‚Äôs putting in all of the effort and I never want to do anything, all I want to do is sleep. He feels 
like he has to keep it together for both of us. 

All of these things are very valid and I feel really bad but I don‚Äôt feel like I can give anymore right now and it the timing feels poor and unfair. Don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre here for me when you‚Äôre clearly not. 

Sorry for the long rant but any input is welcome "
"No matter what it is, drugs, alcohol, video games, nicotine. It seems like I‚Äôm drawn towards it and it just consumes me. I know doing these things is horrible for me but I almost find peace in saying ‚Äúfuck it, I don‚Äôt care‚Äù like there is almost a relief in just completely giving up. In the back of my mind I know it‚Äôs fuckin horrible for me and I‚Äôm just ruining my life but it‚Äôs so hard to give up all of these horrible habits I have. "
"One of the girls at my medical college whom I used to see most of the days of the week gradually started skipping classes. I asked her if everything was okay and she said she had some important bussiness to take care of and she'd be back soon. Most of us believed her. 

She hanged herself in her hostel room last morning and none of her closest friends could tell why she did it cause she looked completely fine this whole time. Her closest friends have been blaming themselves since and crying hysterically over how they never even suspected such a thing to happen. How could no one ever tell?
 
Now, most of my batchmates have been posting ""RIP"" or 'descriptions of how good she was as a person' over her pictures and I don't know how she would feel about it. What is it that goes on in the heads of suicidal people and why is it that we fail terribly at making them want to live? Do they think about friends and family before doing it or does it not matter at all in their moment of despair?"
"title pretty much says it all. when I say mean, I don‚Äôt mean like I‚Äôm actively bullying people or going out of my way to be a dick, but fuck. Strangers trying to do small talk, people smiling, jokes, these small things‚Ä¶ it just pisses me off. Like I mean more like getting irritated over stupid things, taking stuff overly personal, being cold‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs like the only emotion I feel besides numbness is intense annoyance and it just poisons everything. I‚Äôm so sick of it

There will be times at night when I‚Äôm reflecting on the past or things I said/did that day and I realize how needlessly standoffish, cold, snappy, passive aggressive, rude I‚Äôve been. Like everything irritates me in the moment and I can‚Äôt control and it just ends up making me more miserable because I realize this isn‚Äôt who I am

Has anyone dealt with this or experiences the same thing? I feel as if this is one of the uglier parts of depression that people (mainly those that don‚Äôt have it) don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm a complete shell of who I was and I know it‚Äôs wrong and fucked up but I can‚Äôt change anything so this anger and venom just grows"
"I lost my best friend, my wife. I have struggled with depression for a long time and I‚Äôm taking a overdose 

Edit: thank you to all who reached out to my brother but unfortunately he‚Äôs gone. It‚Äôs insane how many people messaged and replied."
"When is it supposed to turn into living? There's no sense of progress, of moving forward in any direction. It's like I'm stuck running in place. I have no feeling of the passage of time since life feels like one long blur that I'm watching through detached eyes."
"I was raped and I came here for advice. I‚Äôm a straight guy and I was raped by another guy, so I got a lot of jokes about my sexuality. They kept telling me I‚Äôm closeted and I wanted it. It destroyed my marriage and my wife ‚Äúouted‚Äù me to all our family and friends. And I‚Äôm not even gay. I don‚Äôt have anyone I can turn to. I feel alone. And I don‚Äôt know how to fix this. I‚Äôm not homophobic, but I‚Äôm not gay. And now the whole world thinks I am. It‚Äôll affect any future relationships I might have and I don‚Äôt know if anyone will believe I‚Äôm straight anymore. I‚Äôm a joke. And I feel ashamed and embarrassed. I am getting some support, but it‚Äôs 50/50 positive and negative responses. I guess I‚Äôm naive, but I thought people would be more sympathetic. I‚Äôm disappointed but not surprised. I knew I would get a handful of rude responses but I wasn‚Äôt expecting this. And I‚Äôm not sure how to deal with it."
"I don‚Äôt want to die. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm scared of dying, even. I don‚Äôt want to leave my parents behind, or my friend, or my boyfriend. I don‚Äôt want to hurt them or burden them with loss. I just want to have never existed at all. I want to disappear, to have never been there at all. No one remembers me, no one misses me, because I never existed in the first place. I don‚Äôt hurt anyone, I just fade out, and I never felt like this in the first place.

I am too much of a coward to kill myself, and I love the people around myself too much to do it. I just wish I wasn‚Äôt here."
I just don't understand how most people go about life with the most carefree outlook. Meds don't help and any type of caffeine just doesn't work for me.
"I don‚Äôt know why, but i‚Äôve recently gotten significantly worse. 

It‚Äôs never been this bad. I can‚Äôt bring myself to do anything, and I hate myself more than ever which I thought was literally impossible. It hurts. I‚Äôm so frustrated, upset, and feeling every negative feeling under the sun.

Hell, i‚Äôm not even taking my medication regularly, i‚Äôm not eating well and i‚Äôm just not looking after myself at all; I literally can‚Äôt deal with it anymore, everything hurts and I wish that I could just sleep forever or die in my sleep. None of this is worth it anymore, life isn‚Äôt worth it and my efforts never amount to anything. I don‚Äôt know why I try when nothing ever works out anyway.

I‚Äôm so done."
"I smile, I laugh. But I'm not happy. I've never felt excited for anything. I don't wake up to be awake, I wake to be in darkness again and sleep. Pushed all my friends away and had no family. Life is fucked."
"Does anyone feel the same way?

I feel absolutely no joy in anything. The world is such a dark place. Yet I‚Äôm overly anxious at night and struggle to follow a consistent sleeping schedule. Too tired to even shower regularly.

I just want to hide away from this meaningless and cruel world and find my peace of mind."
"You‚Äôre born into the world beyond your choice, and just have to accept it. You‚Äôre not guaranteed to have a good - or even decent - life, and will likely end up having the complete opposite. You‚Äôre essentially doomed to live miserably in third world countries.

From before you‚Äôre able to think for yourself, you‚Äôre fed a load of bullshit dogma about life &amp; morals in the hopes you‚Äôll become just another cog in the shitty systems that run the world.

You‚Äôll be heavily discriminated against for having traits that aren‚Äôt your choice. Every world leader is an egomaniac who puts their interests and beliefs above all else; billionaires who could actually do some good are just higher valued pawns to them.

Most of the world‚Äôs population are idiots (including you &amp; I) because we were made to be, growing up. People just swallow whatever their gods in office tell them; believing the lies and propaganda which just causes fallout between the masses, keeping us distracted as to not notice the real enemies.

So, you‚Äôre expected to live in a world like this until it kills you. Suicide is condemned yet it‚Äôs the only way out of this living hell, and if you do push through and live your life, you‚Äôll probably just die unsatisfied about it and with more regret than you would‚Äôve had.

Somebody tell me with a straight face this isn‚Äôt a dystopia. What‚Äôs even more depressing is that most are already aware of all of this but can‚Äôt do anything except accept it as it is. 

No, there isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù in the world. If there was any, it‚Äôs gone now.

Life is only worth living if it‚Äôs been tailored for you."
"She saw one person with severe depression, and  decided that it works like that for everyone, and that if I sometimes smile then I am just ""sad"" (sometimes) and not depressed. I have a lot on my head. Keeping my work, providing enough to take a credit for our own appartment, planning a baby... And after all of this worries, there is also a dream of having a steam deck to play at my (rare) free time. And yet I was said that I have nothing to worry about, and I should not say that I have a depression, because she wants to laugh at my face anytime I mention it. So just... Take more work (but also find time for wife), and shut up. No one cares about your emotions, especially if this person is not able to fix it with a simple ""you have no reason to be sad""."
"Some random shop owner? on the street yelled ""Hey! Hey, excuse me!"" at me yesterday as I was walking home from work. It was cold, so I was walking rather fast, and it had been a bad day. I turned around, confused, and he asked me kinda sneeringly, ""are you happy!?"" Stumped, I didn't know what to say and just stuttered for what felt like an eternity, then said ""uh, why are you asking?"" He just looked at me with this awful, degrading smile.

""Because one of the days, you looked - like - sick in the head, you know? eh? no? Yeah ok whatever"" then he just shrugged and waved me off. 

I felt so awful afterwards. Why did he verbally attack me on the street, a random stranger like that? Certainly not because he actually gave a shit about me. He didn't even seem concerned, just like annoyed that I was walking around depressed? 

It distressed me so much that I spiralled into a deep, dark hole and almost offed myself yesterday. Called in sick for work today. Can't ever go the same way to work anymore in fear of seeing him.

People fucking suck."
I just want to say am proud of y‚Äôall who CAN go to work/ and school. I can‚Äôt. I 24 f unemployed and the longest I have ever worked is 5 months. I have a high school degree and no energy to go to college. I have also no energy to work. Am lots of words to describe how drained I feel thinking of indulging in a regular people‚Äôs activities (work and school). But for those who can I am genuinely happy for you it MUST be nice.
"I'm 30 and as I've gotten older the more closed off I became, alone with no one. besides working a full time job, I play video games all day everyday. I pay rent for an overpriced small apartment but the cramped dull room in the back is where I've always dwelled. At first the depression was crippling that I couldn't function, but over the years I've become content since its been like this most of my life. The smallest boons like hearing the birds on a beautiful morning, or driving to the store on a sunny day has me tearing up with both joy and sadness, like my body is starved from any good feelings that come from life. "
"It sucks. Everywhere is a constant reminder of it too, doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs on the street or on social media ‚Äî I can‚Äôt escape the constant reminders of what having a normal life looks like when you aren‚Äôt mentally impaired.

I hate it here."
I feel ashamed of myself and hate getting attention from others.
"I posted here a few days ago, and i appreciate the kind hearted comments you guys sent me, but i‚Äôm tired. i can‚Äôt deal with this emotional pain anymore. it‚Äôs like suffocating. i tried my best to stay here, and help others, but i just can‚Äôt deal with this shit anymore. so many hopes, and dreams of helping others, like helping kids with cancer, helping homeless people, etc. All gone down the drain. I‚Äôve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for almost two years now. My whole chest physically hurts. I‚Äôm so fucking drained from life. I never did anything to anyone, so why do i have to suffer? I‚Äôve been nothing, but a kind, and empathetic person, only to end up living a shitty life? i really can‚Äôt do this shit anymore.

edit: i ended up taking a bunch of pills. it hasn‚Äôt kicked in yet though. "
"It's kind of funny cause I always thought that the awful urge to end it all was just the effect of several big problems or shortcomings in someone's life, and because of that I also thought that, with enough effort, everything could be fixed, but it goes way beyond that, and since a few months now I think I'm realising why, and how. 

An important piece of what I was is missing, and even if things around me are getting better, I can't enjoy it, not anymore...

I just don't know how to keep going."
"Don‚Äôt ever start with porn, It‚Äôs rotting your brain away.
I, 17m, started watching devil‚Äôs videos when I was about 12-13 years old. Back then, I didn‚Äôt watch any specific type of videos, just whatever popped up on the front page of ‚ÄúThe Hub‚Äù.  Over the time, I started to look into different categories and started looking for other websites that had more videos on them because I was bored of the same videos over and over.
Like a dark hole, I was dragged into an addiction which I can now, no longer quit myself. I usually jerk off every day for the past 5 years, sometimes 2 times a day, sometimes not at all for over a week but as time passed, I couldn‚Äôt bear stopping myself from touching myself. I watch really specific type of videos and sometimes even masturbate for over an hour. 
I am too afraid to talk to any of my closest friends about it because I‚Äôm too scared of getting rejected by them for being so fucking disgusting. 
I‚Äôm not even the type of guy, who couldn‚Äôt get a girlfriend because of my looks, I‚Äôd even say I‚Äôm pretty lucky for my genes but whatever happens, I always come back to porn.
I am not clinically depressed but this makes life increasingly tough for me.
"
"Wtf is the psychologist meant to do - wave a wand and say ‚Äúobliviate‚Äù? 

This is from someone who has been seeing someone for 5+ years too. Sometimes all I need is a hug and someone to care - not more medical attention."
"I get it. This is how people ""go bad."" This is how people become cruel and uncaring. This is how people do horrible things to themselves and others. 

They start off with ambitions, hopes, and dreams. They want to have good things, and believe they'll get them, if they work hard enough. They try. They fail. They try harder, only to fail harder, in multiple areas of their lives. Over and over again. 

Every failure makes them more bitter and hopeless. It gets worse every year. Each birthday is a self-check-in. ""What goals did I accomplish in the past 365 days?"" Not a single one. 

They see everyone around them doing better, or at least improving slowly. Meanwhile, they have no verifiable progress in anything, despite working hard. Still in a miserable job, despite sending out hundreds of applications and completing certifications to boost their resume. Still unhealthy and overweight, despite exercising -- probably picked up a new physical ailment in the process. (Diabetes, thyroid problems, back problems, etc.)

They're still single, or in a toxic/unfulfilling/dead relationship. All their friends are gone, whether they've moved away or not. Silence kills more friendships than distance ever has.

Every single dream is on its deathbed. Lack of time and skills, or just everything else in ""adulthood"" being ""more important."" Or, maybe they realized all the other things that go into their dream, and have concluded they simply aren't cut out for it. Too old to start. Too introverted. Too unsure. Too broke to invest in it.

When everything goes wrong in the exact wrong ways, despite best efforts, what else can anyone conclude? The universe/god/gods/whatever doesn't want you to succeed. You were put here to suffer and fail because you lack the fundamental elements of self to do better. No amount of therapy can fix that.

When everything is taken away, what's left? No hopes, no dreams, no light. There's no reason to be a better person if you get kicked down for it.

This is how villains are created. Negativity doesn't form in a vacuum. When the universe hates you, you hate it back. When I die, I hope I don't see ""god."" I don't want to meet my abuser. "
"Everything feels so tiring and too huge of a task. It takes me hours to actually start something and finish it. I have been brushing and having showers in the evening. I don't want to do anything. Even after my therapy sessions, I feel so drained and tired. I had taken some days off from work and days just passed by without much happening 

I want to get out this hellhole. I want to be Happy but I am struggling to break out from this low point."
"I‚Äôve been dealing with depression and OCD my entire life and have personally found that ‚Äústaying active and stimulated‚Äù has little correlation to how I feel. I‚Äôve been this way for as long as I can remember and I would have flare ups in symptoms randomly throughout my life independent to whether or not I was working, studying, exercising, doing stuff, etc."
"Had infinite potential, so bright and lively and grew up to be a disappointment. It's like looking at a different person entirely."
"If you see this I probably have already done it. My emotions are all over the place and I just cant deal with it. I wish everyone better luck than i had. Depression is a real problem and I wish I'd had more support in real life, but it is what it is.

Goodbye.


Edit - I am still here. It didnt work. I will try to respond to everyone. Honestly I am not ok mentally but thank you for the nice comments. "
"Hey im leaving this community and deleting this vent account, i have finally found my reason and happines 


Yo boy is starting pilot training soon 

  I hope that everyone here finds their way out but im happy its finally over again hope it doesent come back again  "
I thought life would get better. Once I was out of hs I thought I'd be free. Here I am at 25 feeling the same way. I have crippling social anxiety that has got me fired from my last 3 jobs. I don't want to find another one bc I know the outcome. My husband is stressed with bills and looks at me differently. I wish I killed myself when I was 16 I was wrong for having hope. I wasn't meant to be here. Medicine doesn't help. Therapy never lasts. I feel like a fly in a glue trap waiting to die.
"(Look at the bottom for the update) 
Yeah so i am gonna kill myself soon, i literally give up. I hate when people tell me to ""never give up"", like you havent been in my fucking shows man. Im actually sick of this generation and this social media shit. Im from the middle east and moved here (edit:Australia) when i was 7 and was bullied to now. I used to have friends but those turned against me and i was suicidal fron late 2020 to still now. My dad always said that death is the best thing because you dont have to worry about anything whenever. I dont think i care if i get hurt or shot or any of that. Yes ive also talked to my fucking close friend about this and i still remember him crying over disocrd call, begging me not to do it. I was quiet whike he was crying. I also talked tk the councillors and yeah parents got told, they got a shock and supprted me. After a few months I stopped being depressed and yeah and now after new years i feel depressed.

This time i just dont care anymore. Im literally not caring about school or anything i just want to be gone. I go to a fucking christian school, get told to read the bible everyday and i do but nothing happens. What a fucking waste of time "" read and he will guide you"" like bitch im about to kill myself and im not caring about school and you call that a "" god's plan for you"" fuck outra here bro. Im also fat and have literally given up losing weight. I look on yt and it never works. I have fucking ADD and take meds. I watch porn when its night and i play games instead of homework. My life is basically done woth this year 11 shit. 

Cya later might not be there to reply

(Edit: (this might be a whole essay)

Thank you guys so much for the support, to be honest i never thought people would actually respond and stuff. I an feeling better now and reading these comments just shows that there are people in the world who actually care. I over-exagerated some of the things I said here. Yes I was suicidal for a while and now that something happened at school and the support i got from my parents yesterday, I am doing alright. I have had friends who commited suicide because of what things you and I have gone through. To those people out there who have friends that are like sad or dont talk much or feeling down, talk to them. I also think that ending it all is just not the solution. Like I get it, I was suicidal and I also thought ending it was the only solution, but just do something productive yk. Go for a walk, swim, talk to parenrs or siblings or anyone. Walking is great in my opinion because you enjoy the scenery and it makes you forget about the depression stuff. 

If you also have watched tiktoks about ""real"" please fucking delete it. The thing is that when you look it at these slideshows, makes you get upset because you ""relate"" to it. Watching it more will get worse. 

I would love to one day make a discord server for the lonely people, no matter the age and gender and whatever, yk to talk and chat and make friends. 

And for the depressed/suicidal people out there, listen to me, just because you had a bad day today does not mean its always going to be bad. Yesterday i had a fucking rough day and now im feeling good and everything. Just imagine this, if you were dead you wouldnt be able to do the cool shit like drive a car, shoot a gun, kiss and have sex with a girl or boy, everything yk. Like if you feel/-are depressed/suicidal, just go outside wether its day or night and breathe in and out. Think as hard as you can the ways and solutions to your problems. Getting bullied? Hit em back or report it to the teacher. Abused by your parents? Tell a friend, teacher, anyone. Go to the gym, i just came back from school and signed up for the gym. Who cares if you dont know what to do at the gym, give everyrhing a try and see how it is. Try cool shit in your life yk. If your going through stuff then share it on reddit, the lads here are very supportive, my dms got flooded with requests. If you need anything comment and ill do everything to help you, just dont kill yourself.

Thank you.)

I wish I can reply to all the comments here and god bless you. I found christ aswell and now in good hands. I know its been less than 24 hours but ive been going through this for 5 years and im finally free. Im going to make a discord server soon so invite friends and if your lonely, join up so you and I can be friends. I will also make tickets for people who are asking for help and I will hear your story, and try to find a solution, ending it all is never a solution."
"I am a 30 year old male. Since i was a kid i have been very shy. growing up and at school i had no friends. so after school i would just stay home and watch tv or play video games. and besides school i really did not leave my house often. After high school is when i isolated myself for a long time. Around people i had very bad anxiety and instead of facing my fear i just hide and had no encouragment from family. Noone seemed to care. When i was 28 i got my first job and my anxiety is bad but i have to work to help with the finances. But still have bad social skills and do not talk unless i have to.   
Me living this reclusive life used to not bother me that bad until a few years ago. The realization hit me of how much behind i am in life. Also how boring my life has been. my grandparents who raised me did not have much money and we rarely went anywhere exciting or fun.  
So pretty much most of my life has been spent at home. I turned 30 months ago. And just can not believe how much i screwed up my life. Most of my coworkers are teenagers or young adults and seem to have fun lifes. They talk about plans after work or relationships or trips etc.  
I do have a few online friends that are also reclusives or former reclusives.  
When im at home i mostly just lay around and do nothing.  
I feel like quitting my job and just hiding like i used to. that i am too far gone.  
I have dreams but feel like they will never happen.   
lately i have just been feeling very depressed and hopeless. No moviation to do anything but sleep and nothing brings me joy.  
maybe someone will listen."
"I found a job. I go to gym. I always eat healthy
 I take supplements. I am not fighting with my family. I do my hobbies.

I have couple of friends. Last night I went out and it stuck me how good time we had, how beautiful the moment was.

I have plans. I want to travel. Learn a language. Play instrument. I want to write a book. I have notebook of ideas. I wish I was loveable and have relationship.

I still want to die. Most of the moments. I don't want to get up. I don't care about myself. I keep wishing I was never born. 

I think I will never change from this state."
"I tried every single thing for so many years. I became a runner. Got tons of sun. Had cold showers almost every day. Found purpose. Found meaning. Changed my thinking. Even CBT worksheets. Believed in the future. Find hope. All of it. 

At some point I finally realized none of it did shit. The moment it got quiet, how I truly felt would show up; deep sadness for no reason. It was all self-gaslighting and repressing. It took so many years but I finally realize I'm not creating the depression, it's not my fault, and it's so relieving to realize I'm not the one doing it.

I realized even the negative thoughts is a symptom of depression and you can't think different your way out of depression.

I'm now working on trauma healing. That's another possibility I will exhaust and I had some of the least depressed days of my life. Its like I could taste the weather. My self-blame or internal shame for no reason is gone. If a hurtful thing happens I'll quickly be back to being emotionally regulated again. Sad for no reason and emptiness? it is also lower. 

I work on creating feelings of safety and body scan/awareness. It creates weird shaking releases in my body and I believe it's either fight or flight energy releases or trauma release. Anyone has experience with this? "
"Every day, I must imagine some scenarios and delusional fantasies. I'll think, ""Well, In the future, I might experience this (visiting places, finding love, etc), so I should try and continue living."" Is this a normal way to cope with suicidal thoughts? I wouldn't say I live in them completely. But it's become the only thing I can cling to when feeling down. "

If your reading this I am so sorry that I've done this to you I just can't bare with this life anymore, none of you are at fault really. everyday is become repetitive even if i try change things up  school is making me so much worse I wish they could just understand me, there's so many people out there that hate me for no reason when I've never done anything to them. I'm sorry for being alive honestly I'm shocked I'm still here. I love you all I swear you guys are the reason I made it this far. i just feel so drained I don't feel like I'm gonna make it in life, clearly I wasn't made for this world anyway. everyone hates me for no reason they turned me into this when I haven't done shit to them. fuck I wanna be the old me so bad even if I still went thru bad times when I was younger I didn't feel as bad as this. I feel like no one truly loves me except my family. I'm so fucking ugly omd. I love summer but I hate the short clothes that come with it and my eczema gets so much more worse I feel like nothing can help it. I hate my fucking hands.

Note for mom (translate to romainian for her)
mom I love you so much you've always treated me so well every time something went wrong you were always there to comfort me, even if sometimes we argue we always turn fine in the end. this is not your fault at all you've done your best to help me. I love you so much and nothing would ever change that. I hope you recover from this and succeed in life. I'm sorry I'm dead I know you tried your best to get me help and I know your going to go through hard times when u read this (when I'm dead) school and people are too much for me to handle. I love you so much

Note to dad (translate)

Dad you were always there making jokes and making everyone laugh,I'm sorry I don't talk to you that much I really hope you can forgive me. I'm just too tired to go on living this life I don't even want. I'm so sorry and I love you so much. I hope you succeed in life

Note to isabella.

you were always there for me making me smile, everytime you knew I was sad you would always help me. thank you so much for being my sister your so awesome and you were always kind to me even if we argued we forgot about the arguement like 2 hours later and would go on walks. I'm so sorry one of your sisters is dead but I can't go on I've been trying for too long. you were such a big part of my life in the best way possible. thank you so much. I love you don't forget to stay strong make sure no one tells u nothing that make u feel down and If they do go sort them out because they are all insecure little bitches who are so bored with their life that they make someone else feel bad about their life because they just can't stand seeing someone happy, but honestly stay strong don't let this bring you down. i hope you succeed in life

Note to sister

You were nothing but funny and calm, everytime I was mad or sad you would always make me feel better, youd always argue for me with no hesitation, like I wrote about isabella, don't let this bring you down, you guys have eachother and that should help, please don't let me bring you down stay strong and tell rude people to fuck off because they aren't worth your precious time. I love you so much. i hope you succeed in life. you went through so much yet your still alive, your a true survivor. I'm so sorry I really hope you can recover from this I never meant to hurt anyone.

note to Zara 

I'm sorry for everything you've been through, I can't believe how much a person could understand me and I thought you should know that you mean so much to me and you should never feel bad because of someone. if anyone makes you feel down it's because their so depressed about their own life's that they try to bring someone down with them. honestly I feel like your the only person I can talk to without being scared that you would leak it. I'm so glad your still here and you got the help you needed, even if you have some bad times it's just a natural part of life, shit happens but you just gotta make it through to prove all them people wrong. ilysm and thank you for being here, I swear I tried my best.

You were the best cousin I could ever have. even if we had some ups and downs we always found our way back to eachother. I'll miss playing Roblox and calling for 3 hours straight. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. you were so kind, I hope you succeed in life.dont let anyone bring you down. Ur the sweetest soul I ever met and I love you so much your so beautiful don't let anyone tell you otherwise I'm sorry sometimes I don't have time to call sometimes but you still accept my apologies. your so sweet don't let anyone bring you down and if they do ignore them because they are all too insecure about themselves that they have to bring someone else down with them.

boyfriend

you were the best boyfriend I could ever imagine. you understood me really well even if we had some arguements we still talked it out and stayed together in the end. I'm sorry we couldn't grow up together and I'm sorry I have to leave you this way. I love you so much and I'm so sorry please don't let this bring you down my love.

12/2/24 11:10

i wanna kms so bad rn, it's getting worse I can't help myself, schools making me feel so depressed all my friends are leaving me out even if I try include myself, I don't feel like I belong here. they always ignore what I say and I have to go by myself everywhere and they don't wanna walk me to the toilet because apparently I'm too ""bossy"" but I don't think I am. they my only friends I have other then my fr friends aqsa and omaima. sometimes I can't find them though so I'm stuck by myself or with my other ""friends"" we used to be the best friend group but now they only care about radiyah. I clearly don't mean much to them anymore. I wanna hang myself so bad rn but I don't want to leave my family, they are the only ones who understand me. I don't want my mom to cry neither my sisters or my dad or anyone else, I'm trying for them. I'm gonna try win this battle I've been fighting for years. I wanna selfharm so hard but I can't because I don't wanna get caught. they thought I'm better and they probably think I'm just making jokes out of school and taking the Mick out of them but I'm trying, this school is filled with awful people that don't care a single bit about what your feeling as long as they get popular or attention, I've been trying to hold myself together forever but I've been getting worse in school. I want to have a future but part of me thinks I won't make it that far. What has happened to me. I just wanna be normal. I miss the girl I was before school. please help me Im so ugly. I wanna slit my throat open. there's no end to the pain bruh. it's gonna continue until I die. life can come with ups and downs but it's been down for too long. why am I still living. why am I not hanging myself right now. please. I'm so sorry if I ruined anyone's life, I'm just a bitch that ruins people lives. I feel so bad for being annoying.I'm sorry for being alive but imma think of changing that soon. Hopefully some day I just jump off a bridge. people at school keep insulting me yet they expect me to ignore it when I'm so sensitive? JUST FUCKING LISTEN TO ME. STOP MAKING EXCUSES FOR MY EMOTIONS ACTING LIKE THEIR YOURS!? fuck. school has drained me so fucking much and I just wanna slit my wrists and bleed out. people keep telling me these feelings are temporary but they feel like an eternity. i should of been murdered the day I was born. I didn't mean to be annoying or anything. everyone just ignoring that I'm obviously not okay.  my phone dry asf even when it's not on dnd mode.
nobody ever understands me, please just kill me. I keep imagining myself dying soon anyway. I don't wanna hurt people. why do they always hurt me. I'm sorry for coming into your life, clearly I didn't belong there, I don't wanna see my mom cry or worry but I always end up making her worry. I'm such a bad child. my hearts so heavy

26/2/24 12:19

the cycle starts again in a few hours, I don't want to do this anymore, my WiFi always gets cut off at 11 now and it's so annoying because I can't go sleep before 11 even if I try force myself or even relax myself, I'm just gonna be stuck in an endless loop of my thoughts and this note, schools making me so depressed right now. my bffs have their own bffs that obviously mean so much more to them, my friendgroup cares about radiyah more then me now even though she just joined it, so much for inviting her in because she was being left out of her other friend group. now I'm the one getting left out. our trio was perfect until she joined and made it four people. three people now. they replaced me, I feel so empty bro. all I do is start arguements for no reason man. I wanna kill myself but I don't want people to feel bad.I can't stop crying my heart hurts. 3 year friendship gone down for a 3 month friendship. I feel so unloved. I love too hard man, I don't feel like anyone understands me. I saved someone like me though, she's getting the help she needs now. she said that she couldn't of done it without me and that makes me feel better but I still feel like shit. damn people really hate me huh. I love my family so much, I think they love me too. I enjoy playing with Isabella but at night when she leaves the thoughts just come back. I think I have depression. I can't go a day without thinking of killing myself. there is no end to the pain.
I hate school so much it's 6 hours of expericing hell. no one understands me there even though they all think they do. I wish someone understands me. is this world even real. the only thing getting me through life is music and my family. without them I woulda been dead rn. I keep trying to starve myself but I can't turn down food. I'm scared people won't like me because of my body and my hipdips. this world is shit. it's all gonna go down one day. I'm so happy our lives are temporary. people with perfect life's make me jealous.  why can't someone truly care for me. every night, every time I'm alone, every time it goes quiet, before I'm about to sleep all I can think about is ways to kill myself. I'm only 12. please stop my pain. I just want to have a fun happy life like the other people, I wanna be skinny,pretty, funny and all that. I feel so fucking ugly. I love my boyfriend even though I get obsessive over him he still calms me down and stays with me. he's someone other then my family that understands my feelings. I think he's the person that knows the most about my life.


26/2/24 11:19

I don't have anywhere to put my feelings except for this note. I don't think anyone understands how bad I've been getting. it's been like this for over 1 year, thinking about suicide everyday, selfharming, getting angry for no reason, I just want it to stop. I just wanna feel like a normal person. these teachers are making me feel like shit even when I'm trying my best. ""(name) what is this , this isn't enough"" clearly plastic surgery won't be enough for you. fuck. stop making me feel like this. I feel like a shadow everyone ignores. I lost all my friends. I hate my life, why does it have to be this hard. why can they have the perfect life and be happy after they destroyed mine. why aren't they getting karma. fucking dipshits. I just wanna cut myself untill I bleed out but it's not like I can because wtf am I gonna do if it doesn't work? go around walking looking like I'm some zebra? no thanks. fuck I just wanna kill myself. but I don't wanna leave my family behind me. they care about me so I don't know why I feel like this. I ordered stuff online for 10 quid so atleast I have something to look forward to. I barely made it through today, everyone's just messing about and talking to me like I'm some type of animal. I've done nothing wrong I don't understand why they keep doing this, they know how it makes me feel yet they keep fucking doing it. what are these heartless dogs doing in school ""this school will help you with bullying and mental health"" clearly fucking not because I'm getting bullied Infront of you and your choosing to ignore it. my eyes for school just fucking worsened I don't think I'm making it far in life. at this point not even music can help me get through lessons, I hate everyone here. please just stop hating me I don't know you. parents need to learn how to raise their children because clearly this world is going to shit.  I always end up setting a date for my death but I never go through with it because I'm such a pussy. I just wanna feel alive again. I fucking miss my old self when I didn't care how I looked, what people were saying to me. I just wanna escape this life.  no one will ever understand me even if they think they Do. no one knows me more then this note knows me. ""give me Ur phone"" ""no"" ""are u hiding something?"" yes this fucking note since everyone wanna be such a bitch to people who haven't even done shit. I just want someone to notice how unstable I am and not make fun of it. I miss how fresh cuts looked on my wrists but I can't do it  again because I'm in forced recovery. cutting my internet at 11pm isn't gonna do shit with me being late for school. it's my desire to die when I wake up making me late. ""Ur too young to feel like this it's just a phase"" clearly it fucking isn't because I've been in this phase for so long I feel like I'm never getting out.

7/3/24 11:04pm

I fucking hate school so much, I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone. all the teachers think they understand me and that I'm just a bad person but I swear I'm not. I'm not trying to be late or have an attitude i cant fucking help it. they texted my dad about how im being late too many times like wtf atleast I actually came to your lesson instead of not coming. ""wheres your homework"" idfk bro I was tryna kill myself the other night because of this shit hole. they all want me to do better but they don't understand that I'm trying. this world is so fucked up bro I feel so bad and stupid. I don't think I'm gonna make it far in life. I literally hate myself. I hate my thoughts. I hate my mind. why am I like this. I just wanna be happy please I've done nothing wrong. I wanna become the best version of me but obviously I can't. this life feels impossible. I already settled on my decision to kill myself soon. even if I don't want to I know its for the better to just leave my family alone, even if it will make them feel bad soon they will realise I was a problem. I walked home from school crying and atleast someone asked me if I was okay. this world is such a fucked up place. what did I do to deserve this. I seriously hate my life. I'm gonna kill myself but I just dont know when. no one understands me. their all fooled by the fake version of me that I put on. I'm nothing better then a freak. I just want to be a child again.

"Everything feels fake. Christmas especially just makes me feel so so much worse about myself, I'm so lonely during these days and it's hard knowing that everyone else is having fun and being with their family and things like that when I'm alone sleeping on someones couch, I haven't gotten gifts since I was 12, and my family is the absolute worst. I just want the holidays to be over, I know that this will be my last Christmas so I guess that's a nice thing to know but I just want to go to sleep and sleep through the holidays, you know?? Does anyone else get 1000x during this season? "

"I've been planning this for a long time. I don't care if  I'm 'too young' to be thinking like this. If you were in my situation you'd consider suicide too. Being born worthless, HIDEOUS and UGLY, dumb, lonely and mentally ill is a curse. I don't know what I did to have this life, I'm kind to my abusive parents and I tolerate the nasty comments I recieve on a daily basis about the way I look. God must hate me for making me a black ugly woman that looks and speaks like a man. At this point why didn't he just make me a boy.

Kids stats: 12 years old. Social Anxiety. Depression. Cutting. Suicidal. Numb-  Is scared of expressing or acknowling any feelings beyond annoyance. Tries not to cry over her Dad or anything. Doesn't like physical touch since the funeral as everyone had to hug her repeatedly and she hates being touched since then. She was molested around 7 years old by her female cousin who was probably about 12 when she did it. .  She has been  bullied by kids at school and the girlfriend of her late father., my kid also became a bully until we moved &amp; changed schools. 

My daughters is 12 years old.  Both sides of her family have a strong history of mental disorders, depression, suicide, etc. She's been in therapy for 2 years, even before her Father killed himself last March. He wrote a Facebook goodbye that she read and he texted us both as well. She lost her 7 year old half brother at the same time as the mom of her little brother  makes awful decisions like separating grieving kids from their only siblings 

She showed me she cutting her.arm &amp; she told her therapist as well. She says she wants to be dead already, but she says she doesn't want to make herself die as that's scary and painful- she wants to not exist but supposedly doesn't plan on killing herself even though she says she's suicidal. 

I'm her single mom, it's just the 2 of us in a house I own in the west. It's a nice home and a typical if not a bit above typical childhood if you dont count her suicidal dad, his awful damaged girlfriend &amp; the molester girl cousin from being counted in the judgement
 Those are bad things though, and both sides of the family are heavily with mental health issues. She has love and support from good people-  she does orchestra, a after school math club, jujitsu and cosplays on ticktock really well. Those were by her choice. I did not pressure her Into anything like some parents do. She taught herself cursive and learns foreign languages for FUN!

She did say that because of me she tries so hard to always do the adult thing and not be childish and is not experiencing her childhood as she should. And I can see how I inadvertently did cause that with my actions and how I talk with her and explain everything to her in depth with my best attempts give her all the shortcuts to be able to thrive and flourish. I didnt see how I was hurting the childlike little kid part of her childhood at all until she informed me of her experience and shared her point of view on the affects of my actions. I see it now though.

Yes I will keep her in therapy and I will keep my patience and keep talking to her the right amount, and I'll keep our daily life healthy and involved the right amount as best I can. - PLEASE LETS HAVE A DISCUSSION, ABOUT WHATEVER OTHER ADVICE THAT IS NOT THE EXACT SAME LIST COPY AND PASTED ON ALL THE WEBSITES. 

(except for the therapy part- that list could just have as easily been written guide to keep your 1995 tamogatchi keyfob techno monster pet heathy and growing as it is for advising the scared parents of depressed &amp; suicidally at risk children &amp; teens.)

Please. I need your help, guidance, anything that can help me think or see or react better is precious to me. Thank you."
"Everything is made up and most people forget to think about it. Gender roles are made up, our clothing and gender expression is made up, social rules/etiquette are made up. School is made up, grades are made up, the system is made up. The little tasks we do every single day are mostly repetitive: shower, go to school/work, chores, walk your dog, eat, sleep. Why does any this matter? In my opinion we‚Äôre just making time here. We‚Äôre just animals. Life is about keeping yourself busy until you die. Even the stuff that‚Äôs ‚Äòexciting‚Äô and differs from your routine is still repetitive, when you get together with your friends what do you guys talk about? Same things, work, school, plans for the future, trivial shit, etc. How many more times am I gonna go to the cinema to watch a new movie before I die? How many more Christmas do I have left?

Plus I think life is so long, sometimes people make videos about that one calendar someone made that‚Äôs like ‚ÄòYour life in weeks‚Äô and when I look at that shit I can‚Äôt help but think wow, that‚Äôs a lot of time. It‚Äôs like wohooo I‚Äôm 18 now, 70 more years (if I‚Äôm lucky) to go until I can naturally die. Why is any of this meaningful? People be like life is too short but it‚Äôs too damn long. Yeah, a year goes by fast, but 70 years? I don‚Äôt think so. I just wish I could speed up the process, I wish I got cancer or something or that I died in a car accident, but I think those things only happen to people who really wanna be alive. Idk why these things don‚Äôt usually happen to suicidal people haha"
I'm not suicidal but I just can't wait to go to sleep again. To get unconscious. Mute the world and my thoughts. It's peaceful. It feels like living is the bad dream and sleeping is my way out. Small doses of death. 
"How am I supposed to get myself dressed and out of the house when I can't even get myself to shower or brush my teeth most days? I don't understand. I genuinely love walking but I struggle with getting myself to do it, just as I struggle with getting myself to do any of my hobbies."
"Honestly, nothing manages to shatter my mood quicker than this. 

Seeing someone with the same level of education (hell, sometimes even less), someone that faced similar financial issues, someone with similar hobbies, or someone with similar family problems. Hell, I remember once seeing someone on TV that even *looked* a lot like me, had a similar background, but ended up with a far more accomplished life. And, obviously, I'm also talking similar age range, too. 

Nothing hurts more than this, because it really displays how much of a lottery life is. *Ultimately,* this really showcases that no matter how fucked up you are, or how far behind you start, things *can* turn around. But, often times, the way they turn around is outside of your control. 

Parenting is the major factor, imo. Couple shit parents with a shitty situation, and your chances of making it drop exponentially. Things like the entourage you have, place of birth, year of birth, hell, pretty much anything to do with health, too... None of these are things ultimately within our control, but they're also crucial if you want to overcome certain issues. 

And seeing someone overcome problems similar to yours simply because, by chance, they had that one good friend, or that one good coach, or that one good *anything...* It's horrible. It's horrible because it's pure luck, and it shows you that, with even some minimal help, you could have really turned your life around, too. 

And then you look around, see the shithole excuse of a life you have, and can't help but think to yourself... 'damn, I didn't need one billion dollars, or superpowers... I just needed one mature person to rely on, back when I was a kid.' Horrible feeling."
I am too fragile. I'm triggered by everything. This makes living life and doing what I need to do to survive extremely exhausting. I'm losing empathy for other people after being disappointed by them too much.
Everyone‚Äôs gonna die eventually many people get sick and they start rotting even before dying. I wish I wasn‚Äôt born everything seems so disgusting. The nastiness of this world. What we say what we do where we end up. What is this life. How do I live without thinking about nasty things without experiencing them 
"(Probably gonna delete this cause everyone's gonna remind me how much worse women have it, but I just need to rant quickly)

[Edit: not deleting yet, but asking everyone to ignore or take what I said with a grain of salt. People have made it clear to me how women have it worse in all of these factors of life, and I do not want to take that away]

[Edit #2: We're done here, I'm sorry to everyone I offended, I'll try to keep to myself next time]

~~I hate having to just ""suck it up"", and ""be a man"" about everything~~

~~I hate being expected to help everyone else with anything they need at a moments notice, but never receiving the same help~~

~~I hate having to wash my sisters car all the time because it's a ""man's job"", but I also have to do all the housework every night cause it's ""sexist"" otherwise~~

"The feeling of waking everyday hoping today is the day you‚Äôll find a reason to do more than the bare minimum: 

The feeling of waking up after not showering for 3 days and you are dirty. 

The feeling of the house being a mess. 

The feeling of an empty bank account. 

The feeling of everyone around you looking at you wondering if you‚Äôll ever ‚Äù figure it out ‚Äú

The feeling of losing friends. 

The feeling of losing weight. 

The feeling of losing opportunities. 

The feeling in your chest that hurts everyday and runs down to your stomach. 

The feeling of having 100 pounds on your shoulders all the time. 

The feeling of simple tasks in life being extremely difficult to do. 

The feeling of having no meaning in life. 

The feeling of losing control. 

The feeling of losing every bit of hope you once had. 

I fucking hate depression and wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone. I just want to be happy and be myself again.

"idk if he was right but i was at my therapist earlier today and he kept asking me questions i didn‚Äôt know the answer to so i responded with ‚Äòi don‚Äôt know‚Äô and after some awkward pauses he told me that i was a waste of his time after which i got up and left, now my mums mad at me for it, am i over reacting?"
"I wasted my best years because of depression. Growing up, unlike all my friends, I never wanted to ""be"" anything, dentist, lawyer, you name it. I basically faked it so hard and went to university, but I eventually dropped out.
I've always been an introvert but in these times I became more and more lonely. Now I literally don't have any friends. I try to avoid all my problems with playing guitar and listening to music in my room. I'm tired of faking my smile.

So yeah here we are, at 26 years old I have nothing to my name. Still don't know what to do with my life. Probably in the near future I will work 6 days a week in a job that I absolutely hate and try to survive with the lowest salary. Even the possibility of doing this for the rest of my life is enough to make me sick. 

Yeah, I guess I'm too weak for this world.
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

"Anhedonia is a symptom of depression, the lack or reduced ability to feel pleasure. I think it's the worse part of depression, we all experience sadness at some point, but when coping mechanism don't work how can someone realistically function in society. Is the entirety of adult life just coping or is that just the people like me. I couldn't imagine growing old and feeling this way.

Some people say they love life and are rarely depressed. The last time I felt thay way I was a child. I haven't felt like that for at least 7 years. I really do think I'm screwed. When you have depression for a while it really becomes painful. The anxiety too. I don't function like a healthy person. I'm always tired. Even when I'm thinking of nothing. I feel empty. I think much of it comes from childhood neglect. I don't think I'll ever feel safe or loved. I don't even know what it feels like. Being  around people gives me anxiety. 

When I try to be a normal person with healthy habits. I have mental breakdowns. Doing anything consistently even eating or sleeping normally is so tiring. If I do one productive thing, I'm drained. I feel nauseous often lately.

I don't know what it feels like to want anything. If I could sleep forever I would. 

I wonder how many people feel this way. I must sound insane to most."
"I never fit in with other kids growing up and never really did much of anything, I just went to school, did homework, and hung out by myself around town and I never managed to really make friends or get involved in any activities or build a sense of identity, and now looking back on those years it makes me really angry to realize that most people get to enjoy those years because they're normal enough to make friends easily. I hate that no one bothered to notice that I needed help or reached out to me because I could have been saved if someone had cared. Everyone says your coming-of-age years are critical to your development and you have all these movies and television shows that idealize those years and make it seem like a magical time in your life that you'll never get back, and I hate that I'll never know what it feels like to have friends to grow up with. I never got to have fun at summer camp with friends, I never had friends to go to the mall or the movies with, I never dated in high school or went to the prom or had anyone to celebrate with when I graduated, and it makes me hate anyone who did get to do those things because they're part of a society that hates people like me. 

 I think I might be screwed up for life because I never really learned how to be independent from my family and I don't have any sense of what I'm good at, and I don't really want to move forward with my life knowing that all these other people get to feel so happy and accepted during their teens and 20s. It's partly my family's fault because they think autistics have no future so they forced me to keep living with them and move with them to an isolated neighborhood where there's mostly just a bunch of old people around, and I have no hope of getting a job out here. I'm 33 now and still feel like a teenager on the inside because I never got to be one in the first place. The only thing I want now is to go back in time, to wake up and find that I'm still 15 and just starting high school or something, and I'm seriously thinking of hurting myself or other people if I can't have that."
"I struggle to spend money usually. Today I brought, without a second thought, a specific tool that will make my method work for absolute certain. I brought a setup to do a trial run as well to make sure it's going to work. If it doesn't, I'll have to source a plan B.

Then all I'll need to get is a bottle of wine and possibly some weed or benzos to numb myself on the day.

Every single moment of today I was on the edge of tears. I was constantly fantasizing about death, of the absence of pain, of existing (sort of, i believe in the continuation of the energy of our soul after we die, i just believe our conciousness ceases to exist in the same form) of the feeling of dying and it finally being over. Its gotten too hard to accomplish even simple tasks. I feel exhausted. I'm weak. I can no longer hold on.

It's going to end anyway, at some point. It's scary but less scary than living."
"I‚Äôm 20m, I don‚Äôt have irl friends and I‚Äôm almost glad I don‚Äôt.

I‚Äôve been depressed/suicidal for roughly 6-7 years. My evergoing struggle to become happier and enjoy life more has only made me more bitter and resentful. I often get jealous of the lives of others and I hate myself for not being able to make it like they did. I hate myself because I‚Äôm not good at anything, I have no interests and I can‚Äôt do anything right. I‚Äôm always negative I never believe positive feedback. I‚Äôm developing anger issues and I often damage my own property on a bad day. I don‚Äôt want to socialise with anyone, even my own family because I don‚Äôt want to deal with their expectations and the responsibility of being close to them.

I know deep down I still care about people and want to enjoy things but I can‚Äôt show it anymore. I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing anymore, I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm still here."
"It‚Äôs pretty self explanatory. I could give you a rundown on how I feel and why. I could go back to my childhood and tell you my story. But I am so tired. I am 20 and I feel more than ready. Something has given me the final push. I have planned it for tonight. I am scared. But I am ready. I have no one to tell or say goodbye to who would want to hear it. 

I want to put it down somewhere so if it works, I can be remembered for what I‚Äôm about to say. 

I tried to be kind. 
I love my animals. 
I love humans, but they were just too much for me. 
I was strong. 
I was polite. 
I was full of love. Too much love. 
I was full of dreams. 
My biggest fear was being a monster.

"My friend tried to kill himself beside me while I was asleep beside him.

I felt him shake. I felt him shake and convulsed, silently gasp for air. I paused and, thought, let him die. How dare he put this in me. I don't deserve this memory, this baggage on my life. For a second I thought I should let him suffocate to death for putting me in this situation. But then I saved his life.

I am forever scared from this memory.
But I feel guilty for pausing."
"i dont think people realize how much being financially unstable takes a toll on your mental health , im broke constantly worrying about money having anxiety over money i cant live how i want to im always worried about bills etc‚Ä¶ i cant be happy because im always worrying about paying for something .

"I've been thinking a lot about how exactly those around me would change in the event I dissappear. Pretty sure everyone at work hates me so no trouble on that front. I don't think my family would care much either. I mean, what exactly do I bring to the table for my family? Self esteem issues and depressing thought. 

I've learned to power through my negative thoughts and make it to the end of the day, but I don't think I can keep it up much anymore. 

In short, I don't think anybody would care if I were to off myself anymore. Nobody cares about me now. What would change given the circumstances? Besides what utility do I serve? I'm pretty much useless at any task. I still have no idea what I want to do with my life because I have excelled at nothing I've tried in life. As a matter of fact, I'm surprised I can get dressed in the morning. "

"My best friend passed away in a horrific car accident back in October, and I heard it happen as we'd just been together at my house, but I'd left a few minutes prior. I even drove past it on my way back from my errands, not realizing from the damage it was their vehicle (I think maybe my brain didn't want to realize it was them); since the accident, I've had a tough time, especially since we are only in our early 20s. I still find myself crying a lot three months later, and I carry a lot of guilt for reasons that led up to the crash, but since the accident, l've found it hard to leave my house besides going to work and find it hard to be around my other friends as it's just a constant reminder my best friend is dead. The few times I do hang out with my friends when they leave, I have horrible anxiety over it, and if I feel like the goodbye isn't good enough, I get scared because my goodbye to my best friend was very carefree. Even tonight, when one of my friends left, I broke down and cried. I've never handled a loss like this, and I want to feel semi-normal like my other friends do now, but I have a hard time moving past it and would like some advice. (I was diagnosed with depression in my
late teens but it‚Äôs the worse it‚Äôs ever been and even the medication isn‚Äôt working)"
"So, despite what it felt like at times, I made it through 2023 alive.

Just seeing everyone else's life being better than yours sucks. I don't do anything I'm always in the house and have no friends to hangout with. I just wish I was dead sometimes.

"On top of all the other issues I'm facing, I'm just feeling so tired with life itself. I'm so tired of the routine of going to work every day just to pay the bills. I mean, just look at how the average day goes in the average person's life. We get up, we go to work, we watch some TV or whatever, go to sleep and then do the same again the following day. We typically do this around five days a week, with a couple of days to enjoy ourselves then repeat the cycle week in and week out. We do this for decades of our lives and for what? We tell ourselves that it gives our lives purpose, but it's bullshit. It's a lie that we tell ourselves to make ourselves feel better.

I'm so done with this endless cycle. I don't want to do this for another 30 years. Any pleasure I get from life is short lived and it's really not worth the drudgery of everyday life. 

We don't even get to choose life. We are essentially forced into it, but we are expected to be thankful for it. I'm just thankful that one day I'll be dead, that there is an end to it all. I'm so done with life."

Aren't we a resilient bunch?"
I have no friends. I'm a very introverted person so I thought it would be ok. I've always had trouble making friends. Not talking to people for so long really changes your perspective on life and the world. It all feels so pointless now. No one to check who you are as a person. No one to exchange ideas with. No one to joke around with and laugh with. Now that I'm 29 I'm really looking back and thinking I made my bad situation worse. Since I haven't talked to people in so long I've realized that it feels impossible to make friends. I'm also ashamed of myself and who I am as a person. I feel very pathetic. I have a bad memory and in a lot of areas it feels like I have low intelligence. I feel like I will never understand math or economics for example. It feels like anxiety and depression has stolen my life from me.
"Maybe I won't kill myself today. But I will definitely do it one day. My parents are literally the only reason why I cannot kill myself because it will permanently scar them. I am thinking of waiting for a few decades, eventually when they will pass on from this world, then I can kill myself without worry. But I will most definitely kill myself, I am not going to live a natural life and going to die a natural death, that simply won't happen. The reason is that I really don't see the point of anything at all. There is absolutely nothing in life which excites me in any way. I don't have any dreams or ambitions for the future. There is absolutely nothing that I want to do in life. I just want to not exist, that's all."
"As a child i always looked at adults and got mad whenever i saw them zone out and just look depressed. It pissed me off. I would ask my relatives to laugh and be happy, i swore to them that when i grow up i would be the fun adult. 

Now that I am an adult, i am no different. In fact, I‚Äôm worse. I fucked my life. Everyone is disappointed. Nobody wants to look at my face. I am repeatedly told that i am a disgrace. They are ashamed of me. They are done with me and i am done with myself too atp. It‚Äôs hard living like this. Even if i go somewhere else i know the damage has been done and it will follow me. I can‚Äôt make friends, i can‚Äôt look at people in the eyes and overall I‚Äôm always scared. Everything that i touch gets ruined. I fucked up life. My parents are the smartest people i‚Äôve ever met and a daughter like me is a disappointment. They deserve better. Everyday i think of ending it. I wish i could disappear or combust. Why is life such a race? Why can‚Äôt we enjoy the little things? Why am i made feel guilty for doing the small things that i like? 

There aren‚Äôt many good things about me. I am honestly such a waste. My dad said investing in me is a lost cause. On a daily basis i wonder how death would feel. The idea is an escape from reality but the other side doesn‚Äôt look that bright either. I am a sunk cost and the thing about sunk cost is that they should be cut off asap. "
"My 18 year old daughter has depression/anxiety. She moved to the dorms in August but hated it so much she came home. Luckily we are only 10 miles from the university. She finished her courses and passed them with As and Bs.  But since her last final she has pretty much gone to bed and won‚Äôt get up unless she has an appointment.   She has a counselor and a psychiatrist and they just upped her anti depressant. 

I have today and tomorrow off work. It‚Äôs already almost 10. Should I drag her out of bed, shove breakfast down her throat and make her do SOMETHING?  (Bake cookies work on a hobby put up Xmas lights, anything?)"
There was this girl in my school who committed suicide after scoring perfect in exams and projects and coming to school everyday. I've also known people who say they've been in depression but they have succeeded very well in life without any gaps in their career or any noticeable absences. How does that even happen? And here I can't even get out of bed.
"It‚Äôs recently come to my attention that the current insurance covers suicide. My partner and I have struggled so much with bills lately that its send me spiraling hard the last couple of weeks, the straw that broke the camels back was hearing my partner sob when they thought I was asleep. I have never done anything worthy of recognition in my 29 years of pathetic existence but just this once I can do something that matters for someone I love so much and be free from all the bills and the hatred of the world, it‚Äôs a win win."
I genuinely don't remember the last time I did and I don't even do it at least once a month. It's really embarrassing to admit but I think my teeth are genuinely rotting away but I'm so young and don't wanna lose them or be made fun of for it. I have no idea how to want to brush them daily.

One morning after working 12am-8am I came home and gave my mom insulin but it was the wrong one. She died the next day. I was so scared I took her to the hospital, I never told my family what happened only that she just went down hill. I couldn‚Äôt admit I killed her. I can‚Äôt live with myself, I miss her so much and I wish I could change it all but I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve told no one that I killed her and since then I‚Äôm on a downward spiral, I do drugs to make the pain go away. I‚Äôm in so much debt, I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed ever. Honestly I wish it was me and not her. The world is empty without her. I don‚Äôt deserve to be here."
"I'm 25 and my friends are working and getting married and getting kids and having ambitions. They are being loved and I feel like they know exactly what they are supposed to do. 

I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I've always been depressed, I can't find a job, I never had a boyfriend, I never felt love, I never felt being enough. 

I'm not sure about my identity, about how I should talk, how I should dress. I don't know what I like and what I don't like. I feel like an empty shell. 

Am I doing something wrong?"
"I wake up every day and regret my life. I have so much misery. I'm still in college instead of graduating at 22 like I should have been. I'm not currently married to the girl I want to be married to, and I'm not having non-stop sex every morning and night before waking up to go to my six-figure top job, which so many people my age at 25 have and are doing. I won't be buying my nice big house at 26 or having kids before 30 at the rate I'm going. What's the point of even getting up every day and continuing life? Can anyone else relate?

I don't want to finally be 35 and married and have kids before 40. That's not life, and that's too late. Your 20s is the time to marry, have kids, see six figures, buy a house, and everything.

I know so many people I‚Äôve met that are friends and family and just people who are 24-29 and have everything I stated above what did they do right that I did wrong and maybe I should just accept that I‚Äôll never have a good life or success or wealth‚Ä¶. 

Fuck my life‚Ä¶"
"By the time you read this, I will be dead. I don't think anyone will be surprised that I finally did it. Maybe that's the worst part of it all. I have made people so worried, but they won't have be worried that it will happen- because it with certainty did. I'm tired of being in pain all of the time, and I'm tired of being so lonely. People tell me that I am not alone, but I have been alone for a long time. 

  I have loved and will miss everyone that I have ever had in my life, but I am not sorry that I did this. I hope you will understand, but no one has really understood me in the first place, so it wouldn't be the first time.

  The funniest part of it all- is that I deserve this. I wish things would have ended up differently, but there's got to be a reason why I failed. I'm tired of distracting myself with video games, music, or some other thing. I'm tired of having to talk myself off the edge every time I feel like killing myself. I am a terrible person. Don't feel sad for me, because it's either live a long life of feeling like shit or cutting it short. 

  My therapist told me that I should be nicer to myself and be curious about life, but I can't do it it anymore. I deserve suicide. My mental health has already caused pain for the ones that left, but mostly for the ones that stayed to see me slowing die. And don't even get me started on all of the hospital bills- and I don't even feel any better. 

The fact is I'm sick of watching everyone have fun with their friends, spending weekends having fun, complaining about stupid shit like guys that don't love them or tests being hard. I used to be like that, and the pain of losing it all it too much to bare. I don't want to live a life as the ghost of the person I used to be. I'm terrified of spending my 21st birthday alone. I would rather be dead.

Don't say you didn't see this coming, because if you didn't, then you truly didn't know me at all. Donate my body to science. Peace out.

With love

Edit: It's been a few days since I posted this. I'm thankful for all of the comments and DMs. To give an answer to a few questions, I am in therapy, did reaching out (as I hinted,  reaching out made me lose a lot of people and one person told me I was over sharing), and I am on meds. Nothing in life seems worth it or interesting to me. I sometimes feel okay, but it is overweighted by emptiness, loneliness, and depression. Today was my stepdad's birthday, and I didn't want to ruin his birthday with my death, but it has passed. I still think I'm going to do it. I picked the building, and now it's just a waiting game. Or maybe I will buy a gun.

Edit: 2 months have passed. I am doing a lot better. My birthday passed and it was a great amount of fun. I'm not perfectly mentally healthy, but we are starting to want to live again.

Edit: 3 months have passed. I graduated college!! I also started Prozac in addition to my other meds, and that was really helpful. I reconnected with one of my best friends from high school, and it has been really nice to talk to her. I also tried animal crossing, so that's been my hyperfixation. Overall, I am doing a lot better, but there are still some rough spots.

Edit: 4 months have passed. I guess I might do this as kind of a journal. It's been helping me out- coming back to it and reading it. It's crazy because I read what I wrote 4 months ago, and I feel like I don't know that person anymore. I understand who she is and how much pain she was in, but I feel so far removed from that and it's amazing. I don't want this to sound like a success story because I still have really hard days and nobody's success story is going to help. But I digress. I still struggle with self-harm but I don't feel suicidal everyday like I used to. I am really doing well because it's the summer but also I have plans with new friends that I made. We plan on going on a camping trip in a couple of weeks so I'm super excited about that. I was hyperfixated on Animal Crossing for a little bit but I found two horror games that I really really like. I'm applying to jobs. I still haven't found one, but I hope that I'll find one eventually. I also met this guy right after I posted my last update. He is really cool, and he lives far away, but I'm going to meet him at the end of this month. I'm super excited! I don't want to rush into anything though obviously because I still have a long way to go with my health. I have been doing better in therapy and it's been helping me a lot more than it has been in a couple of years. Anyways that's all I have for today.

Edit: 5 months have passed. Hey guys, it is time to give another update. Thank you everyone for the continued kind messages. And for those who commented cruel things, I hope the best fot you as well. I found a good job that I am going to start in a few weeks; I am going to be working with children with special needs. I am nervous, but I am also excited! I never saw myself working with kids, but this is not what I want to do long term. I really want to get my PhD; it is my dream. I lost that dream before all this... I want to make it a reality. I am still struggling with self harm and big emotions, but I am doing good. You know that guy I talked about? Well... he is going to be here today! I am so excited to meet him in person! Welp.. anyways... I hope you guys are doing well... Much love &lt;3"
I am bedrotting since my early teenage years. Honestly I thought it's normal or at least something that a lot of introverted people do. Am I wrong?
"I am exhausted. I have pushed through many difficulties, including the suicide of my brother 20 years ago, and I am about to get fired. I don't have a retirement fund, I have a new grandson, and if I check out, I know how my family will feel, having experienced my brother's suicide. He was miserable. I don't blame him one bit. I am having suicidal ideations constantly. I will be a burden to my family once I lose the job. I feel the burden of my suicide would be an easier burden than having to support me for the next 20 years, which my family can't do -- no money.

Thanks for listening."
"I've considered killing myself a lot recently. But I've never really got to even attempt it, not because I'm scared. But because everytime I wanted to try it wasn't possible without hurting others in the process. Why does it have to be so hard to actually do it?"
"Above actually killing myself, I wish I was never born. Does anyone else relate? Killing myself would mean hurting my family and friends, as well as giving up on the chance of me actually being happy one day. All of this could‚Äôve been avoided if my parents never brought me into this world.

I wish I could just disappear. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up. I wish someone would hit me with their car while I‚Äôm driving and I‚Äôll die on impact."
"My brain ruined my entire life. I am stuck watching everything from the outside. I never felt a sense of belonging or home anywhere and god knows I have LOOKED for it. I made terrible choices based on my poor understanding of the world.

I live every day with a brain that feels like a prison. I feel like I'm already dead a long time ago. I am not a person. I'm a void. I lack something others have. At 27, I'm stuck watching life pass by. 

I am literally trying every possible remedy you can think of to get a chance to live, but the more things I try which are ineffective, the deeper I sink. 

It's like this list of all the things to try, and the last thing on the list is ""end your life"". And the list is becoming shorter. 

I hate autism. "
"Back in March of this year I almost attempted suicide. The only thing that stopped me from killing myself was one of my friends. The thought of them finding out I killed myself made me not want to really do it anymore. I wanted to stay alive for them because of how good of a friend they were. Now almost three months later I feel alone, worthless, useless, and I feel like no one really cares. The person who I wanted to live for doesn't really want to talk to me much and it seems like they don't want to care about me because they're dating someone now. They think that other people thinking that we're dating is weird now that they have a boyfriend thus they turned off alerts from me so no one knows that I text them often. I feel alone because of that, it feels like they don't want to talk to me now. They're the only person who I enjoy talking to and now they don't even want to talk to me. Life is just doing the same things over and over again maybe finding some happy moments in between but I don't want to live through that any longer. I wish I took the chance to kill myself but now here I am pretending to be happy wishing to be dead every single day. I don't enjoy anything anymore, I can't sleep very well, and my luck is so fucking bad. I don't fucking know what to do and idk how much longer I can go on."
"Alone.  Isolated.  No one talks to me.  Social phobia.  ocd.  I don't like happiness (I love sadness). Do you know what the problem is??  All of this is because of depression. I was born with it and I do not want to treat it. I am in love with depression. Do not be surprised by my words, but I want to commit suicide. My mind is confused and I cannot think. How am I like this?  I hope no one is cruel to me, but I want help. I want to hate depression so I can get treatment 
I fear change because of  ocd because it is linked to depression and they have made my life a curse
How can a girl like me bear all this??  I want to cry, but I can't anymore
Please talk to me. I haven't talked to anyone in years (except my family).

"23F 

All I do and all I want to do is lie in bed or on the couch and get engulfed in blankets while I watch or rewatch TV. I have no job, no motivation, no post secondary education and now no friends.

I have family that loves me and I‚Äôm grateful for it, and I stay for them. I think about giving up a lot and the only reason I don‚Äôt commit is because of my parents. 

I compare myself to other people my age with careers and degrees. I feel like a waste of space and piece of crap. I feel so unaccomplished. I tried uni but had extreme anxiety and panic attacks along with OCD, depression bipolar, PTSD and insomnia. I started having stress seizures and dropped out.

The thought of going back to try college makes me so nervous but I feel like I have to or I‚Äôll end up homeless. I don‚Äôt know. Life is just so overwhelming and adulting is terrible, I can‚Äôt do it right now. Thank god for my parents or Id be living on the streets right now. "

I grew up a very kind person but now that I‚Äôm older I realized that people really don‚Äôt care about you, unless you are affecting them personally they really are fine with throwing your entire life in the trash. People have let me down over and over again and now that I‚Äôm depressed people want nothing to do with me because I bum them out. Does anyone else feel this way. "
"I‚Äôve always been too much of a p*ssy to actually commit suicide in any way, but the idea of it is always a comfort. For the last few years I‚Äôve watched the world move past me and my therapist always tells me that people may not be as happy as they seem, but I know it‚Äôs BS. I like the idea that I can just pull out of life and that nothing will matter to me anymore. I tried to explain this to my therapist once, but started back tracking out of fear I might be sent back to another psych ward. Anyone else feel like this though?"
"The little things that used to excite me. The road trips, the wind blowing my hair, the smell of old forgotten books. 

I miss being excited to watch a movie or listen to a new song. I miss being passionate about that one niche topic, or reading wiki pages for fun. My mind has become completely numb since 2020, I am turning 22 in a few weeks, and I'm scared that this might be my life from now on. "

"16/yo guy here. I‚Äôve recently been abandoned by almost all my friends for being a trans guy. ( I haven‚Äôt actually transitioned or anything, they just found my old Reddit account) 

I have close to 0 real friends, am one failed class away from not graduating, I‚Äôm ugly as fuck, my girlfriend broke up with me and I‚Äôve been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety as well as adhd. I fucking hate school.

I want to kill myself legitimately every day except weekends where I can rot in bed and forget about everything, only to almost routinely break down every Sunday night with dread. I run into the bathrooms and cry every other class , it‚Äôs so fucking lonely now.  I miss my friends.

I don‚Äôt care about my family missing me because frankly I‚Äôll be dead so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôll actually feel incredibly guilty about it. Every time I talk to my psychiatrist or the counselor abi it suicide my parents are immediately notified and scream at me for hours about how ungrateful I am.

I‚Äôm so fucking miserable everyday except for when I binge eat and make up shitty little comics about teenage guys who are childhood friends because I so desperately want that for myself.

I want to kill myself. but there‚Äôs no guns in this damn country and I‚Äôm scared of heights.

I‚Äôm so done. I‚Äôve given up on life. I don‚Äôt sleep well, I rarely shower, I don‚Äôt bother trying to make friends, I have 42 missing assignments, my lunch has been a pint of Icecream for the last 2 weeks.

All those social media  comments are right, I‚Äôm a tranny faggot and I should kill myself."
"I always feel on the outside looking in, and my depression and anxiety made me have doormat personality traits for most of my life, thinking people would not like me inherently unless I made myself a complete doormat for them. I listen to others and be kind to them hoping that maybe some day I may be afforded the same treatment. But when you‚Äôre a doormat no one does that for you, obviously. I passed my teen years and up to my mid-20s now, with literally no one who even checks in on me. I‚Äôm happy for my friends because they all have really functional, full and happy lives. But it does make me sad that I‚Äôm not really part of it. 

Recently I‚Äôve had a very weird feeling of almost not feeling like I‚Äôm inside my body anymore. Like I can‚Äôt feel my body anymore when I get so sad? I‚Äôm very alone, and I‚Äôm just angry that depression moulds you into this person who cannot have the energy to put yourself out there, and even sometimes I feel put off by the thought of being around people, so of course I ended up alone. This illness is so isolating and tiring. How long must I carry on just because I‚Äôm too scared of the consequences of failing suicide?

I dont know what to do anymore. The only thing that kept me from commuting is not wanting to hurt others. But it's just getting worse. Nothing is helping anymore. I dont want this. I can't anymore.
"I got raped earlier this year, and it has completely destroyed me

I can barely sleep, hate being touched by anyone, even just a handshake, cuddle, anything, I despise being touched. Have to shower way more than normal because i feel disgusting after what happened

And I feel so lonely, I hate it"
"A week ago while I was at work I had noticed my husband is not answering my messages or calls. I was at work and had tried to call him many times. We have location tracker and I noticed he was at home which was unusual. I got this bitter feeling and decided to go home early. The commute is about an hour and I could not shake the feeling. When I got home I found he was locked in the bathroom. I knocked and called his name and heard him grunt from inside I started to become frantic hitting the door until finally he opened it. He was drunk, he had a wound on his head, there were knives, alcohol, and pills on the floor. He was not speaking clearly but talking about how he couldn't live anymore. I can't really repeat everything without crying. I called an ambulance and they took him to the hospital. He has been hospitalized since. We live in Europe in a country where I don't speak the language fluently. Calling emergency services, finding the hospital, and even where he was was so difficult. But our healthcare is covered. I cannot sleep in our room, I work from home and somehow I am managing. I visit him everyday and see the man I love a shell of his former self. We have been together for over a decade. We are still young. I just did not see this coming and I am terrified. I don't know what to expect. I myself have anxiety and I feel like the adrenaline and shock is what is keeping me going. I keep praying for him to come home but I don't know when he will be able to. I am eternally grateful he is still here and I am so scared. I dont know anybody here, he is my everything. I don't know how I missed the signs. 

I don't even know why I'm herenin this thread. I suppose I have nobody to talk to about this in my real life. "
"
25F

I am so sick of this life. Like literal life. I am a Christian so I believe in God and positive thinking but I'm literally giving all this shit up. 

I wanted to kill myself at 18 but somehow ended up at college. I graduated in 2020 so that tells you everything you need to know. I didn‚Äôt think I would make it past 18 so being here now is like what the fuck.

God isn't doing anything in my life. My positive thoughts aren't materializing. I don't even feel connection to the shit I believe in and am wishing for. My mind is literally turned off. I made muliple vision boards, read affirmations everyday, and do all the shit you're suppose to do. I can't do it anymore. 

I've been praying for a job that I can start and get into and that will pay me all the money I need and more. I've been battling unemployment and under paying jobs for damn a year and some change. I am beyond that. 

I am suppose to be a rich ass artist and had to take jobs at a gym wearing business casual making $15 an hour. $500 A WEEK. I FUCKING HATE IT. Haven't had a job all year. My heat is off now because I'm literally not making any money. 

I HATE GOD AND ALL OF THIS POSITIVE THINKING SHIT, BECAUSE WHY IS IT NOT WORKING. 

WHAT THE HELL.

I'm late on my rent this month, my parents have been supporting me but I'm tired of it. I want my own money. I want a life I love. I hate where I live even though it was my dream at one point. I might have to move back into my parents tiny disgusting home. I HATE THIS SHIT. I'm behind on so many bills. 

I got a call for a job making $17-$19 but I had to pay $140 for a background check and license in a field that is not the one I set out to pursue. I DON'T HAVE $140 TO GIVE TO A JOB BEFORE I START WORKING IT. On top of that, it could take up to a month to get the license. So I'm out $140 and have to wait a month to even start working. BULLSHIT

I literally don't know what to do. What's the point of all that believing and shit if it don't work. I apply to so many jobs every day. I even made multiple resumes and shit. I literally don't know what to do.

I need money RIGHT NOW and a whole lot of it. Money that's sustainable so I can actually live and enjoy my life, go on vacations and shit. I grew up lower middle class and I hate that's it's following me in my adult life. 

I HAVE NO MORE TIME TO WAIT ON ALL THE POSITIVE SHIT I WANT. I NEED IT TODAY. 

I would rather kill myself then go through all these downs. I've been more down than up and I'm sick of this shit. FUCK THE WORLD. I RATHER NOT BE ON IT IF IT'S GOING TO BE THIS DEPRESSING. 

I've only had one dream my whole life, be a wealthy and succesful tv and film writer, director, and producer. My whole life I've never dreamed of anything else. I started my career as a production assistant and don't even know what else to do with my life after that. I got out that role because iI hated the politics and dynamics of it and was getting severly underpaid, and since I'm a PA, nobody gives a fuck. 

I've had one dream and one dream only. I don't even know what to do with my life. Even if I did move back in, I would just lay down and mope. I feel dead inside. I hate life. I'd rather it be over than feel this way."
"I feel so powerless, and I don‚Äôt understand how people just live their lives, they travel, they date, they move to different countries, they get new jobs and start new lives, and I just don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm expecting a plane ticket to book itself, but I feel so defeated, specially being unemployed for almost a year, just applying to jobs again and again and nothing, one application after the other, and being completely alone doesn‚Äôt help either.
Even small day to day things feel like so much work, so I can‚Äôt imagine doing anything bigger than small routine activities.
I see people doing the most amazing things, making their dreams come true, and it‚Äôs so wild to me, to have the motivation, the drive, to even have a dream at all, to be passionate enough about something to fight for it regardless of how challenging it may be, to keep fighting even when you fail because you‚Äôre so determined to make it a reality, to live your dream life, and all of it just seems so unattainable to me, truly impossible like nothing good will ever happen to me no matter how hard I try, and I just don‚Äôt see the point in trying anymore."
"On Valentine's Day I (21F)had a surprise for my boyfriend(20M) but he lied to me about where he was.I waited for about an hour waiting to surprise him until he told me that he had lied to me and that he was not where he had told me. 

He told me that he had a reason why he did that And he wanted to explain to me.
He told me that for some time he had relapsed into depression and that he was missing college classes for a couple of weeks, and that he didn't want to tell me anything because he was embarrassed of having depression and missing class.
He didn't want me to see him differently because of that problem and that he wasn't good with himself these last few months.

I told him that I was not going to judge him for anything, that I was going to help him to find professional help and try to overcome all of this, but I honestly don't know what to do. What happened that day still hurts me.
And I really don't know to what extent I can trust him, which is obviously what I would like. 

I just want to know what you think, or what your point of view is. 
I love him very much, and I would like to support him and see him improve as much as possible despite everything, but honestly I don't know what to do"
"im not suicidal but Its not just depression, i dont like life or living. Its all too much work. Things to get, relationships. They all are too much work for me to invest in them. All the work for things that make me happy makes me unhappy. I‚Äôm kinda just existing. Realistically not staying alive would be a better option but i dont want to ruin my moms life by it so im trapped existing like a prison sentence. Ive never enjoyed life much except the rare times i have no work to do. I dont want anything from life tbh. Im over life. I have not lived long but i have seen enough already.

"I'm so fucking close to just saying fuck it and figuring out a real way to die. The intensive outpatient care place doesn't take my fucking insurance. If you're disabled and in need of care, nobody gives a single fuck. I can't control that. Fuck you.

"I just need to know if im overreacting. 

So two months into my therapy and my therapist asked me what my goals are, i said getting over my health anxiety and stayin fit. She proceeded to say i have 0 enthusiasm about anything, and i am very dull and listless. And have no motivation to do anything. Just 3 years until 30 and i havent done anything etc etc etc. 

Anyway she followed that up later with me needing to stick to a schedule even if its 30 minutes of work per day blahblah.

I just wanna know if its normal for therapists to point out that you're listless and you should look up to other women and work etc. idk. Maybe im overreacting but i felt really bad. "
"Sometimes it‚Äôs too hard to brush my teeth or my hair and it‚Äôs very often too hard to shower. I‚Äôll go days, sometimes a week without it. I swim 6/7 days a week and according to my friends and family I just always smell a little chlorinated, but not bad, and that honestly makes it harder to shower cuz there‚Äôs no motivation. It feels disgusting that I can‚Äôt take care of myself. 

Related rant- no one understands this part of depression. I‚Äôm not just sad all the time I literally cannot function. It takes everything in me to go to work, which I have to do, leaving no energy to do anything else. My friends are generally supportive but I‚Äôll say I haven‚Äôt washed my hair in a week and they get icked out.

Ugh. I did shower yesterday and have brushed my teeth for a week straight now. Go me."
I know it sounds confusing but I spend every day wanting to stop living and death seems like the best way to do that so I think about suicide every single day. But for some reason i could never convince myself to act on it so its just a repetitive cycle of hating being alive. I sometimes wish I could just disappear from the world without actually killing myself. Anyone else feel this way?
"I am tired of going to work. Tired of hobbies. Tired of people. Tired of socializing. Tired of everything. What's even a point in anything? I try hard to get out of depression. Meds, therapy, working out, socializing. I feel like there is no relief."
I havent left my bed in weeks. I only leave to go to the washroom and once in a while I eat and drink every few or so days. How deep have i fallen?
"I have no friends because they put in no effort or abandoned me, found other better friends. I have no one. I've never had a boyfriend or girlfriend before because im ugly. I'm nearly 24f. I have no one in my life except my immediate family and my pets but I know they don't really love me. Everyone has hurt me or left me and no one wants to hang out with me or be my friend. It's proven time and time again that literally no one likes me. I haven't made a new friend since I left high school, over 6 years ago despite socialising and putting in effort. But no one wants me. 

No one understands how this feels. I have no one. Everyone has left me and no one wants to be around me. I've been used and abused by so many people around me. I'm ignored and treated like shit. I fucking hate myself and my life and im going to kill myself. I have no reason to be alive. I'm a defect, im unlovable. My life is completely over and i never thought it would get this bad. I'm fucking done"
"Can't even pick up my controller to play games anymore. I dread eating or drinking water because I don't want to leave my room for my family to see me in this state. Things I used to do to cope with my chronic illnesses and boredom don't work anymore. Thank goodness I still love music.

I broke a promise to my mother that I won't harm myself anymore. I hate that she cares about me. She lost her own mother that way. She found her body. How the fuck do I end this nightmare without ruining her life even more.

I researched ways to go and I think this time I'd be successful with not much pain. Wish I could just run with it. That's all I could think about recently. My body is giving up on me, the person I loved moved on the moment he was in a better place. Everything feels like one huge prank.

Just 10 minutes and all the torture would end forever. No more false hopes, no more lies, no more struggle breathing and walking and pain, no more gaslighting from condescending doctors, no more analysing and ruminating, no more heartbreak over people that made you believe it's true love, no more tears and bounds of rage, disappointment and self hate. I don't think I'd bother leaving a message. I cried and yelled too much already. Said enough already. Everything has been settled. Just wanna go. I love you mom."
"I can‚Äôt handle anything anymore. Not even the slightest disappointments, criticisms, or disapprovals from anyone. I prefer being isolated. I can‚Äôt even tell a slight joke to someone I‚Äôm close to anymore for fear of the person not reacting the way I want them to. It seems this subreddit gets way less interaction than the suicide watch subreddit, maybe because nobody cares if you‚Äôre depressed, it‚Äôs not as urgent, important, or interesting as someone suicidal. People are only interested in ‚Äúsaving‚Äù someone from dying, they don‚Äôt actually care about anything else otherwise, just as long as you stay in this prison like everyone else."
"By the time you have read this, i have planned to end my life on July 28, 2024 at exactly 9pm. I plan to hung myself in our apartment.

I have also laid this out as kind of a revenge to the person i love, who only treats me like shit.

We‚Äôve never been together, but we saw each other sometimes every month. He celebrated my birthday with me last July 10th. He didn‚Äôt with me when it was his last 15th. But he saw my message to him.

When I tried to give him an advice because the last time he laughed about my previous slight accident, he said that I should not tell him how to act. Then I knew that after all the things I did for him, I didn‚Äôt matter to him.

As of this time, he still hasn‚Äôt seen my message to him about sorry I am when I said that he should refrain from laughing at someone else‚Äôs condition.

Of course, he is not the only reason why I‚Äôm doing this. I have been failing lately at my work. I can only do some mediocre work. I don‚Äôt do that much meaningful stuff. I am also exhausted.

I know that when I do this, I would fail my family especially my brother. But I just couldn‚Äôt keep living anymore.

It‚Äôs going to be my last day on earth at 28th. But I have few things to do. I will say my last words, then I will hung myself.

Edit: I saw all your messages. I will reply to all of them later.

Edit 2: You guys make me feel good now. There is 50% chance I won‚Äôt do it.

Edit 3: It feels like i only have 25% chance to do it. I did my groceries a while ago too.

Edit 4: It‚Äôs already 9pm. Yet I‚Äôm still here.

Edit 5: I couldn't say that I'm happy again, and stopped thinking about it, but at least I am here. And I really appreciate all of the strangers who are checking out on me. I also have made some friends. Thank you for extending my life.

Edit 6 (08-06) Still here. Got busy a bit due to work and some stuff. Been busy also doing some work around the house, and i got to read books again. Thanks guys for being around."
"Today's life feels so purposeless to me. The consumeristic and materialistic society is disgusting and I hate the thought that I'm going to have to work my ass off every day until I'm 70 for some shitty company just to barely afford groceries while the big guys just keep getting richer. It's crushing me. I wish we would go back to a society where people grow their own food, and barter and trade with each other. My ultimate dream is to move out onto some land and raise and grow my own food, to be healthy and connected with nature. But nowadays, that is a privilege. 

I know in the past, when life was like that, people died young, and things were not sunshine and rainbows, but it's got to be better than this soul sucking shit we all have to deal with. Can't afford a house, can't afford a car, food is so packed full of shit that I'm unhealthy and depressed, our government is full of fucking morons only concerned for themselves and their wealth, same with all the corporations all they care about is keeping us fat, depressed, and submissive to their systems. And as an individual, there is no escape from it unless everyone wakes up tomorrow and decides they're done and want to make the same change.

I don't feel free, I don't feel alive, I just wish there was an escape from this hell. But there isn't. I'm so tired. I have been fighting with depression my whole life. I thought these last couple years things were getting better, after 15 years of constant struggle, but turning 18 and having to think about the future has brought it back in full force. I'm scared, I'm exhausted, I'm hopeless. "
"On Tuesday night my friend committed suicide and I feel so guilty. 
My friend has always suffered with mental health problems , she suffered from anxiety and depression, she often self - harmed and I was the one she usually come to when it happened, I helped instruct her on how to clean it and bandage it up, this went on for a couple of years. However about half way through last year, she stopped and in PE I saw that her arms are clean, I assumed she had gotten better but I see now that I was clearly wrong, I should have asked her. 
Now that I deeply think about it, it was around this time she gained this obsession with calories and becoming skinny, she dropped 20kg in about 4 months and I don't think that is healthy. She stopped eat as much and was excessively counting calories . I tried multiple times to convince her that she should talk to the school or seek professional help. But she kept on denying, saying that her parents wouldn't be happy if she did that. Her parents I suspect also played a large part in her mental health problem, she grew up in a strict Asian household and she often talked about how her mom was always telling her off and one time when  we went out together, apparently when she got home her mom got angry at her for being happy. She often described her mom as toxic. All of this with what people also said at school about her, often referring to her as ""weird"" and ""disgusting"", must have gotten to her. 

The night she took her life, she texted me at 6pm , asking for help, however I was taking a nap. Which I promised myself I wouldn't do anymore and I regret it so much, I should have been awake, I know napping messes with my sleeping schedule but I was so tired and I just feel asleep. 
This meant by the time I replied to her messages it had been 3 hours. 3 hours too late. And I can't stop thinking about all the what if's. What if I had been awake? Would it have changed anything if I had been? 

I regret not telling the school about what was going on, it felt like I was betraying her trust by going against her. I knew what was going on, so I am not an assistance in her taking her life? 
When she bragged about her collar bones or ribs sticking out , why didn't I say anything? I knew she would be unhappy with me if I did. But if it had saved her, if I knew this was going to happen, I would have done it without question. She always said I was one of the good ones, one of the only people nice to her and that i was a great friend. But honestly I feel like shit. 
If I could turn back time I wouldn't make the same mistakes, if I could have replied to her messages, I am the one she normally asked to talk about her feelings too or for help. And the one time she really needed it, I was comfy and asleep, while she was dying in pain. 
I feel horrible and I wish I could see her again. 
"
"Everyday is a repeat of the same stuff. I get up, scroll on my phone, I don‚Äôt leave my bed. My room is disgusting. I haven‚Äôt cleaned it in a month, nearing two. there‚Äôs fruit flies everywhere. I haven‚Äôt showered in, god I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I showered. Must have been a month ago. I deprive myself of sleep all the time. There‚Äôs rotten food in my room. Rotten milk. I just got out of an abusive relationship (online) and somehow stuck in another. 

My mood swings are terrible. I‚Äôm suffering from other mental illnesses i won‚Äôt disclose. I feel empty. I barely eat. And when I do, it‚Äôs junk. I have no clean dishes. I get irritated so easily. I don‚Äôt feel like living. Staying alive is a struggle. I‚Äôve made two attempts on my life this month. Nobody notices and nobody has asked about my feelings or how I am unless they think I‚Äôm angry with them, or they‚Äôre nosy. 

I‚Äôm tired. "
"It‚Äôs a terrible, complicated feeling to have. Or maybe it‚Äôs not a feeling. Maybe it a recognition of the way things are. Maybe it‚Äôs a recognition of the fact that as long as I am even a bit conscious, I am in pain. I am suffering. As long as I am not unconscious, I will suffer."
"I've been reading other people's threads for the last hour or so, they all have their own struggles in life, or things that have happened in their past and so on. They have real struggles, they have valid reasons to hate life, to not find any will to live.

It bothers me, I'm ashamed of myself. I have zero reasons to be unhappy. I have amazing friends, I have a very supportive and loving family. I have a great job, a great home, a great life. And I hate it. I hate everyday of my life. It's getting harder and harder to maintain this fake wall I have Infront of me that everything is fine. I don't know how to explain it... This is the first time I've said this ""out loud"". I'm lost, lost in myself. Am I alone? Having the perfect life, and at the same time wishing you never were born, every single day?

  
EDIT: Thanks for all the reply guys and girls:) read through them all, and I'm kind of relieved in some way that I'm not alone in feeling this way. I will probably seek out some sort of help in the near future, as some of you have done.

Wishing you all a happy new year, take care of your loved ones and don't forget yourself."
"How do normal people do it? Day in, day out‚Ä¶ waking up, going to work, coming back home, 3 hours of chores/leisure later and then back to bed to repeat the same day you lived yesterday. 

I hate it. How do billions of people do it everyday?"
"Today I sat on the edge of my bed for an hour while my daughters napped.  My wife was out getting her hair done.  I checked to see if she made it to her salon and she‚Äôs at my best friends apartment.  I called him to see what he‚Äôs up to.  He said he couldn‚Äôt talk long as he had a hook up in his room but he didn‚Äôt want to ignore me in case something was wrong.  I wonder if they‚Äôre laughing at me.  I finally put my wife‚Äôs revolver back in the gun safe to write this.  I don‚Äôt think today‚Äôs the day I give up, but it was very close.  Now I have to decide if I give up on my marriage or pretend I don‚Äôt know."
I get jealous when people die young wishing it was me. And the crazy part is that the people that die young are usually people that enjoy life. I wish I could make a trade with them and I take their death and they can live their life.
"This crypto crash, my finance is fucked. I'm bankrupt and lost all my savings. I can't earn my 8k dollars again and that's all what I had. 
I hanged myself using my belt. I was hanged there for a moment and my belt broke. I fell on the floor and was almost unconscious. 
I'm not sure if God gave me a second chance but I'm gonna attempt again because I can't pay me bills, rent etc..

"it‚Äôs always shocking to me when i find out other people live without depression. like i was explaining to the person i‚Äôm seeing rn that i go through ups and downs and my lows tend to hit hard and i end up in bed for days, not cleaning up, really just not doing anything. she was shocked and asked me how this is possible like, ‚Äúhow do you just not do anything, can‚Äôt you just make yourself?‚Äù god i wish i lived that life lol "
I purposely OD'ed after a very heated argument because I thought I would be better off dead. I went to sleep. My husband heard me making choking noises and failing around like a frantic fish. I was not responsive and he called 911. I was strapped down for nearly two days with a coma-like state. He saved me.
"I'm 33 years old. I live with my parents on a rundown decrepit farm my mother inherited even though she doesn't want it and constantly has panic attacks over it. My family is dirt poor. My father is the poster child for undiagnosed adhd/autism and has severe anger management issues. I have a bachelors in theater which is fucking worthless. I have no ambitions, no interests, no prospects, no reason to even get out of bed. I'm on medication but it does pretty much nothing. All I want to do is escape from my life into another reality. Usually via games. I used to be idealistic, I used to dream and hope and wonder. All that is left of me now is the shadow of myself burned into the wall like Hiroshima. My internal landscape is a barren ashen wasteland. I'd say no matter how hard I try I fail but that's not really true. I bring the majority of my woes on myself. 

All of nature exists as a spectrum. There are no absolutes. This is also true of success. There is a genetic spectrum of success. Some people are born with the luck, skills, personality, etc. To be a success. Others are like me. No luck, no drives, just one disappointment after another. A loser born. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is that I don't want to hurt my mother. I could give 2 shits about anybody else. I despise my dad so I legit hope my death would destroy him. He fucked my childhood up and was the driving negative force in my life from the start. I hate my sister too. She's a self absorbed kooky ""pagan"" who drags her kids to drum circles and lives in a ramshackle compound that looks like a settlers home in Fallout. I have told myself that once my mom dies I will go ahead and off myself. Yes I'm fully aware I'm a pathetic parasite. I hate myself too. Just wanted to say that not everyone gets a good life. Humanity is a virus. Consciousness is a curse. There's no hope. No meaning. No point to any of it. "
"It was the most scariest thing that happened to me. i puked at least 30 or more times last night. I was scared to die even though it was supposed to be a suicide attempt. I just felt very suicidal yesterday people are right overdosing is a bad way to go out I just need a hug right now I took 30,000 of pain reliever that's 50 pills I must be very strong to survive that. Am I going to die? My stomach feels a bit sick right now. And I work an 8 hour shift today. And I cut my wrist yesterday, too. I'm going to have a bad day today. "
"I look forward to sleeping at night the most..every single day.

It feels so good to be in a coma-like state for 8 hours, and not be thinking of a SINGLE thing.

Anyone else feel like this?

I‚Äôm honestly so tired of feeling like absolute dogshit. I wish I could fix my goddamn brain.

I tried so many antidepressants and only 1 worked on me in 2020 (lexapro). I got off it for a while then went on it, didn‚Äôt work. Tried so many diff ones, also didn‚Äôt work.

I fucking wanna feel relief for once man"

"I‚Äôm tired, I don‚Äôt have anything that brings me joy any more.  I used to work on home projects, cars, all sorts of things.  Now I just get frustrated and angry.  I used to read all the time, now I get ten pages in and just feel like fuck this.  Work is just going through the paces, I feel like I‚Äôm not even there even when I am.  I really want to die, I would kill myself if not for my wife and kids.  I won‚Äôt kill myself until they‚Äôre out of college and my wife is passed (she will probably outlive me though, so I have to keep getting up every damn day).  My wife doesn‚Äôt want sex anymore, I don‚Äôt know.  I have guns, I can easily kill myself, a .40 caliber round through the brain stem.  I just can‚Äôt do it because I have all these people to support.

I‚Äôm looking for new jobs.  I don‚Äôt seem to be in demand as a senior hardware engineer, or at least I don‚Äôt get calls back.  I‚Äôm taking drugs to make me feel happy.  They kill the anxiety but not the perpetual sadness.  That‚Äôs another thing I can‚Äôt fucking control, I cry all the damn time.  I try to stop, shove push pins in my thighs, nothing works.  Not very manly for damn sure.  I can usually control it in public but my kids see it sometimes and that just makes me feel worse.

Counselors are too damn expensive, though I am taking prescription drugs that help.  Sorry, this is too long, you get the picture.  Ahhh I just wish I would die quickly from something.

EDIT:  Thank you everyone for your support, it means a lot.  I have no friends so it‚Äôs good to know that other people at least have some empathy for what I‚Äôm feeling.  I‚Äôm trying, and I‚Äôll keep getting up and working for my family.  Deep down, though, I‚Äôm hoping a bus hits me or someone randomly decides to kill me.  Not very likely, but I can dream, lol."
"Well 2023 was the pit of hell for me so there's no way to go but up (I hope). 

I lost a cousin that I loved, got my visa denied and had to cancel my dream trip (and lost a lot of money), my pet died, got rejected by the guy I was seeing (he started dating someone else soon after), had to adjust to new medication, lost a job that I liked and the boss at the new one was a nightmare and I'm still hurting for the guy that doesn't even remember my name........ not to mention all the shit going on in the world that leaves me with no hope for the future 

If 2024 is worse I give up"

"I find no pleasure in life anymore. The only thing that gives me any satisfaction is food, but it's all junk‚Äîburgers and pizzas. As a result, I‚Äôm gaining weight.

Sometimes it feels like I'm just a shell of who I used to be, moving forward but already dead inside."
"I‚Äôve decided if I‚Äôm still single at 34, I will kill myself. I cannot take it anymore.

In top of that, I‚Äôm back to square one. Nothing. Single for years. It kills me all day, everyday. I‚Äôve decided I will give it 2/3 more years, and if I‚Äôm still single on my 34th birthday I will kill myself. Has anyone felt this way and decided a date they will end it all?"
"That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the post, I‚Äôve lived the same way in my head with the same ‚Äúroutine‚Äù and way of thinking with the same problems and I‚Äôm tired. 

That probably made no sense but it makes sense to me.

Being in college has only made these problems worse, I hate the assignments, I hate the stress and worry, I hate the pressure to ‚Äúpower through it‚Äù from family members otherwise ‚Äúyou‚Äôll work in a factory for the rest of your life‚Äù or whatever bullshit that I‚Äôve been told my entire life.

So here I am, ‚Äúpowering through it‚Äù, now with passive suicidal ideation on top of depression and severe anxiety.

This isn‚Äôt it man, it can‚Äôt be, this isn‚Äôt what being alive is. I‚Äôm tired of it all."

"Why are interests and hobbies only tiring anymore?

Why is hanging out with friends stressful?

Why does everyone seem to have more charisma, friends, and reasons to exist?

Why is sleeping so hard?

Why won't thoughts go at a normal pace instead of panic or turned off?

Why is getting out of bed so hard?

Why does no one else seem to get it or care?

Why doesn't it go away after so much trying?

Why couldn't I be born normal?

I‚Äôm not actually planning on doing it, I just think about it. I‚Äôm not super depressed but I‚Äôm also not happy either. Life stuff, relationships, etc.

"As the title says, my friend jumped from the 7th floor of his building and now he can't walk. I visited him in the hospital and he is completely broken, he told me how much he regrets doing that and we both broke down crying. 

I've had maybe 15 suicide attempts and somehow didn't face that many consequences besides being commited to a psychward. Most of my attempts were through OD but instead of doing Tylenol or some dumb shit like that, i did actual drugs like opioids and benzos to stop breathing. I did try to hang myself once but the ceiling fan just fell and hit my head which was pretty funny.

I was going to do it again this week but now i just can't, i can't leave him alone like this, i have lost many friends to suicide, friends that if they were here my life would just be better. I am 21 and it is brutal out there for young people, it's so hopeless. Everyone is coping by doing hard drugs and engaging in reckless behaviour, we can't stand ourselves and reality at all."

"25M, just recently diagnosed with chronic depression and severe insomnia. I've always had depression since i was 13 when i entered high school due to no friends and to make it worse i got bullied entire high school years. With me, being a man, no one in my family really understands how depression stuff works, they just assume that i am lazy. Hence, no support from anyone whatsoever. Until this past few years, i noticed that my memory has became bad, mental fog, can't think straight or use brain function properly anymore. Though, i've been working on bettering myself and combatting this but seems like the damage is irreversible. Anyone can relate or got anything to share?"

Now I've lost all that faith. I don't see myself fitting into the big picture. In a box of puzzle, I'm a spare piece. My disappearance would make no difference. 

I'm not spectacular, I'm not smart, I'm not needed, I'm not good at anything, I'm not specifical in any way or for any one. I'm just an average person. And this struggle is not worth going through to keep one ordinary person alive. What to do?"

Just practice good sleep hygiene, it‚Äôs easy!   Yeah, I‚Äôve been falling in and out of sleep, all I need to do is go to sleep and problem solved, right?   Yes, I‚Äôm sorry you are angry at me for not getting to sleep that makes you feel that way - I‚Äôm just doing it by choice right?

Yeah, tearing up here because it‚Äôs SO easy to just go to sleep‚Ä¶.  Never mind I‚Äôve averaged less than 5 hours of sleep for the last year.  Nevermind that I am up despite taking trazadone, remeron and Ambien.  Just close my eyes and I‚Äôll fall asleep directly.   It‚Äôs easy, right?   Right?!!!

You know, Ive just been faking it - never mind the scars on my arms or the suicide attempts, I just need to go to sleep.  FUCK YOU."
"I'm a 33 year old female still living with my parents. I dont make enough to move out as a single woman in this shitty economy. I have a stable somewhat decent job (for now) and pay my own bills. I've never loved or been in love despite multiple talking stages to no avail. I've never had true friends except one childhood friend but she's got a big house with husband and kid now and I'm not worth much to her no more so she dont even see me as an equal. 
Everyday is the fucking same and I'm always alone with nobody to talk to. I have social anxiety and clinical depression that I've had since I was 16 despite taking medication and supplements to help but I'm always stuck with it despite it all. I feel ugly and rejected by society especially in my own small town where people judge you for not moving out of your parents house. I feel like I have no character or support system and just surviving and that alone makes me anxious. I don't know how much more I can take. I'm trying my best to be positive but it's hard. I feel like people reject me or forget about me all the time like I'm never important enough or validated enough to be acknowledged or remembered. I feel like I don't have a purpose. I feel like the combination of the corrupted economy and government with my mental illness is my ultimate failure of a life. So I don't think my life is making a difference or is meaningful in anyway and I wish something will give because I'm at my breaking point."
"I hate having a body, I despise almost every one of its functions. I hate almost all physical sensations, even the pleasant ones are overshadowed by how limited I feel by having a body. I feel perpetually cramped by just existing. I hate eating, drinking, shitting, pissing, breathing, hearing my blood pump when it's quiet, hearing my heart beat. It's all so disgusting to me, how could anyone like any of this? I often feel very detached from my body due to how much I wish I wasn't trapped in one. There is almost no sensations that I enjoy so it is extremely easy for me to become tired with something physically as I just cannot bring myself to care enough. I eat less, drink less. My body doesn't even really tell me when I'm hungry anymore I am just hit with sudden waves of fatigue and think ""oh I must not have eaten or drank in a while. Now I have to."" I despise it. I feel like nothing in this world was meant for me. How do all of you feel about having a body? For those of you who enjoy having a body, what do you enjoy about it? "
I dont know if this is the right sub to post about this but the title is self explanatory but I recently just turned 20 and I feel like my life I just over. I never cared about how old i was or how old i was turning until i hit 20. Maybe im just complaining for no reason but I never had such a big life crisis or identity crisis before it‚Äôs eating me alive. Maybe im just in denial about growing old but I feel like my youth has slipped away and the fun days are over now. I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest to hopefully feel better. Its been stuck in my head everyday and night and idk how to stop it. 
"It's not as if I wanted to be poor, I just am. I mean, ofc I try to improve but it's way easier said than done, it's hard. But people like to make fun of me, how I can't afford expensive things or food, how I can't buy an expensive house or car , etc. I was humiliated in NYE, during the new year, and now I was humiliated like four times already this year. I feel so ashamed that I'm already 25 and I'm poor. Fml. I'm also suffering with depression for years, but it's been extremely bad for the past couple of years, and this ""poor thing"" is being a huge trigger for me. I mean, I was already dealing with suicide ideation, but now I wanna kill myself so bad, like fuck, I don't want to be humiliated for the rest of my life by the fact I'm not rich, so better to just end my life now than spend more time suffering.

"WHY THE FUCK DO PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY THAT IT GETS BETTER? Cause honestly it feels like it‚Äôs only been getting worse. But why the fuck do you say it gets better, like I‚Äôve tried everything, I‚Äôve tried therapy, talking with people about my feelings etc, it never fucking works, in fact I had a depressive episode last week and I actually tried to kill myself but failed. People understand how I feel but they always say shit like it gets better, WELL THAN, HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE A TRIP INSIDE MY MIND AND SEE HOW I FEEL FOR ONCE! Because I fucking wanna die so badly, and when I finally talk about my feelings people always say, it will get better, AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I AM SICK AND TIRED OF PEOPLE ALWAYS SAYING THAT IT WILL GET BETTER! So I‚Äôm done with this pointless life and I‚Äôll probably try and kill myself again, and I fail again and my body gets hurt, who cares about that because my mind is already broken, so why would I give a shit if my body gets hurt?"
"'ve been experiencing so many breakdowns lately, and I can't quite understand why I'm crying despite my efforts to hold it together. This overwhelming sadness just won't lift. I worry that I'm burdening my loved ones, and it feels like everyone is looking at me with pity. I have no motivation to do anything; all I want to do is lie in bed all day. I don't feel like eating or engaging in any activities. I really hate feeling this way."
I think I'd welcome it at this point. I feel pathetic for even thinking this but I'd do anything to hold someone for awhile. What good is all the time in the world if you have to spend it talking to yourself..
"2023 has been the worst year, it‚Äôs been worse than all the previous years, life just keeps getting worse and worse it‚Äôs a downward spiral, everyone keeps saying it‚Äôll get better and it never does, i was told if i open up it‚Äôll get better but it just got worse and now everyone knows about my problems, i wish i kept it to myself, why does everyone lie and give false hope?"
"I want to be able to just, go somewhere. I want to jump off or even just hang myself. But theres not a place I can think of to do so. I don‚Äôt want my family to see my body. I don‚Äôt want anyone to see me or even remember me after I die. I want my friends to forget and my family to just,,, never have to see it. Why is that so difficult? "
"I'm actually gonna commit. I've worked out a date and time and plan. My entire life I've been ignored and overlooked and I've felt nothing but alone and hopeless, and this subreddit helped solidify my decision. I've made two posts prior and have received nothing. No one cared. Just like real life. I fit no where else in life so maybe it's just time to fully fade into the background. Three days after my 18th birthday I will overdose and die in my childhood home, in my childhood room. Depression has taken everything from me, and now it will finally take my life. Thanks to everyone who never cared, it made leaving that much easier.

EDIT: First off I wanna thank everyone for leaving nice messages both in my inbox and on this thread. Second, I'm not dead yet. I spent the last 2 or 3 days in bed sleeping, I'm not joking. I would wake up and then immediately go back to sleep so I haven't seen the notifications until today. I thought that I should come on here and explain a few things about myself. For everyone who thought my depression was circumstantial that is incorrect, I struggle with clinical depression which basically means that all the sadness is mainly cause by a chemical imbalancein my head. I should also preface that I am a drug addict, I do both coke and heroin semi-regularly and have been for months as a way to cope with everything going on. And lastly I cannot be saved. I feel bad and guilty basically telling everyone that I'm still going through with it cause now I feel as though I've wasted everyone's time that they spent writing out those nice messages. I especially feel bad for all of the people who told me about their own personal experiences in an attempt to help me. I'm still going to go through with my original plan and if I live then I live and if I die then ig that's it. I'm going to refrain from giving any kind of time frame as to when my birthday is to try and stop people from stopping me. I hope everyone can understand and won't be angry with me."
"I‚Äôm so done. I‚Äôm so tired. I don‚Äôt feel like pretending anymore

Edit:
I have to say, I wasn‚Äôt really expecting any engagement on this post. Just reading all your comments made me feel a lot less alone. Thank you. "
It's like I have no soul. I have no interest in anything and can't bring myself to do anything. Everything feels like too much work. I can't think straight and feel like I'm going crazy half the time. Not sure if this aligns with depression or not anymore. I'm starting to think my brain is lowering its intelligence as time goes by.
"There‚Äôs something about knowing I used to be a lot happier than now, that makes me feel even worse‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm losing motivation and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll never truly get better, that I will never have that light to my eyes again after consuming so much hatred towards myself and so much hopelessness towards everything"
"Overall I have done pretty well in life, really nothing major to complain about for most of the time. There's just this overwhelming feeling of everything being so utterly purposeless. I just can't motivate myself anymore, or find joy, satisfaction. With reaching middle age, I feel as if the best part of my life is gone. I don't have kids, did most things on my bucket list... I'm just wasting the days now.

Edit: thank you so much for all your comments. It's good to know I'm not alone."
"39f here, severely depressed and in trying to cope/heal, everybody always says ""you have to love yourself"" and I just don't understand that.

If you're somebody who was never shown real love as a child, and you've never known it as an adult, all you know is people treating you like garbage, like you don't matter... how are you supposed to love yourself? How are you supposed to show yourself what love is when you don't even know what it looks like?"
"16M. Apologies for the long read. My life sucks. Always has. I'm an incredibly short skinny ugly boy. I hate the way I look, and how I talk because I'm socially inept and awkward. I hate the generation we live in. I'm so hideous that I've been called ""failed abortion"" my whole life. I'm really stupid too, like really really stupid. However, others get the impression that I'm ""smart"" because I look like a nerd. I'm not. My entire life has been upside down, I've always thought about suicide even from a young age. I remember being so lonely and alone in kindergarten and I promised myself I would kill myself when I reached fifth grade. I didn't. I carried on. ""things will get better"" I said. I kept saying that to myself and look where I ended up. I've been bullied both physically and mentally for a good portion of my life for reasons I couldn't control, (example my weight, height and face). Everything I seem to do I mess up. I really feel like the most unlucky person there is in the world, I always screw things up. I get horrible grades even though I work really hard.  I stay up every night reviewing shit but nothing works.  It's infuriating when I put in all this work and random drug addicts don't even try in school and get way better marks than me. I'm an academic failure. I tried tutors, but they can't help me with the exams. Why is my dream job locked behind good grades? I just want to help people, help those who cannot help themselves like me. I don't want to give up on that dream but my marks say otherwise. Why does school have to be so hard? It's my final year in highschool and my marks are absolute shit, I don't understand anything and no one is willing to help. I try my best in sports but I suck at every single of them, I'm a really skinny toothpick-built guy and I have no strength. I looked and attempted to find something I was good at, but no, it doesn't exist. I used to have hobbies until I realized I was always the one who came in last place. I tried improving my physique. I've been going to the gym every single day for the past 6 months and yet I feel no difference. Either that or progress is really slow. I can't take creatine or any protein shakes because it really messes up my stomach. I'm cancelling my membership next month because I will probably be dead by then. I have really bad stomach issues. The pain is unbearable. I've been going to so many different doctors and all of their ""methods"" aren't working for me; nothing seems to work. I've been trying to hold in my emotions but after a certain point I just exploded which was my biggest mistake yet. I told my family doctor how I really felt and he diagnosed me with severe depression, anxiety, and OCD. My parents got really mad at me, telling me I'm being ungrateful and that there's ""nothing to be sad about"". I hate that so much. Ever since then they hated me too, thinking that I'm trying to get them arrested or something but all I really need is some help.   I was prescribed medication for my illnesses but they didn't even last a week in my household. I threw them out due to the constant slander; my parents would think I would get addicted. My sister hates me with all her gut. She has no more love left in her for me. She's very ageist against teens and thinks I'm being a typical teenager but I've felt depressed for a long time. I can't remember when I last experienced real emotion. I feel cold all the time even though my body temperature is normal. My mother is really scary. She always thinks the worst of me and threatens to self harm herself in front of me. I understand her pain though, but she never understands me. My dad was recently diagnosed with cancer, my younger brother passed away recently too. I have other really unfortunate events that happened in my family but I can't list them all here. I should feel sad but I can't. I feel like I reached maximum sadness. I feel guilty that I'm not sad but everything hurts so much. I have no friends, at least genuine ones. I've been used all my life for other people's benefits. I never had a friend who stuck around with me for a long time. Not only that but I was put in this ""academic school"" for ""gifted people"" in elementary. It's just a lie. My childhood friends were all suicidal and had abusive alcoholic parents. I'm at least grateful I didn't go through the abusive parent part. At the same time, as a result of this, many of them have resorted to self harm, drinking, smoking/vaping. I have never done any of those except for self harm. I don't know what I did to deserve this, all I ever wanted in life is to be normal, to be at least good at something and enjoy it. Instead I got the opposite. I've been holding on to live for so long but I finally settled on suicide. My university application is in 7 days and if I don't get accepted I think I'm going to end it all.  I really want a painless way to go. I'm a pussy, that's why. I thought about overdosing on pills but that has a low success rate. I can't hang myself because I'm too weak to tie a noose. I can't jump off a building because I'm afraid I will survive the height. Please, someone help me get out of this nightmarish hell. I don't know what I did to deserve this. I tried making changes, I told myself at the lowest point you can only go up. I can't. I'm still down here. I really want a gun to my head, everything hurts, I'm tired and exhausted and I've been pushing myself. Sorry for the long read. No one will read this anyways because it's too long. Someone help me, please. If I get rejected from my university I think I will really kill myself."
"As soon as you reached 18, people will start to expect that you act like an adult, don't be too expressive, or ""act like a kid"", I wanna die, so I can at least be out of everyone's hair, I don't care if I went to hell, at least I can finally just get rid of that problem"
"I recall having something similar not that long ago. Depression hit me so hard my head started to hurt, and i had to lay down for a while. Im not sure if it's even possible, hence why im asking. Anyone recall similar disturbance?"
"I'm 17, turning 18. I've been isolated at home for 4 year being ""homeschooled"" but that consists of me sitting on my ass being a fucking degenerate, playing video games, jerking off and smoking. Nothing feels real anymore, everything feels flat and foggy.

I have no social life outside my family because I've been a weird asshole and ghosted everybody in my life, even when they've tried reaching out to me. Talking to people is hard and taking care of myself has been a struggle my whole life, my teeth have decayed so much that I look like a crackhead and can't find dental work because nobody accepts the freeloaders state healthcare.

Therapy and meds started about 4 months ago with 30 min sessions every two weeks and having my mother drive me 3 hours into the city to see a psychiatrist for another 30 min appointment. It's helped a little, but not enough to feel a change for the better. I have one more appointment before I turn 18 and my Healthcare is over.

My mom and stepfather are getting sick of me being a useless peice of garbage and are forcing me to find work, or they will find it for me. All I ever hear is people complain how fucking awful life is and how shitty it is having to work. The thought having to commit the rest of my fucking life to someone elses time, just to make a shitty wage that will barely keep me alive is terrifying and stresses me out. Having to find a house and keeping a car intact with all of the paperwork, insurance and other bullshit scares the fuck out of me, I can't handle that much shit. How am I supposed to support myself if I can't work for more than an hour without wanting to off myself?

It's embarrassing to even post this, but I just need something to complain at it guess. I'm sorry."
I hate working and when I‚Äôm home I have no energy to do anything and I don‚Äôt have any friends and I hate my body and I will never be able to transition and I get so jealous of people on testosterone and I miss my parents even though they‚Äôre shit to me and I want to have some friends in real life but I can‚Äôt because I freeze in social situations and I‚Äôm already 25 and I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything right . Just inject some arsenic in my vein FUCK
I can see a lot of pretty girls outside but I am unattractive and boring. It'll make me go crazy
"
My mother died last night. I'm in shock, minds racing, I don't know what to do. I can't believe this happened, I never will, not like this.
I'm not sure if I used the right flair, but I have to be there for my father who is pretty ill himself. He has sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, heart disease, lung disease, a back implant for chronic horrible back pain, knee problems, had a bypass heart surgery in 2003, he's been through hell. I just don't know what to do, I feel I have to be the rock in, cause after walking into the house and see my dad cry whomever never seen cry, say ""she passed, the coroner came to get her earlier"" which was. This morning, I just need help from good hearted people cause idk how ima get through this."
"I tried to kill myself by OD ing and i regret surviving so much.  Every day is a mightmare and its not going to get better for a long time.  I have no job, and i dont have an education outside of highschool.  I want to really bad but im too broke. My roomate keeps me from eating because i dont buy any of the food. Im only alive because my boyfriend buys me food every other day. It would be better for everyone if i just droped dead, like my roomate suggested.  But there is a tiny voice in my head saying ""it wouldn't be fair to your boyfriend"". "
"I was at the store the early today. While shopping, I (23M) saw this cute Asian woman. The thought to ask her for her # crossed my mind, then I thought of every reason not to. Every reason I'd fail. I kept it moving. It's fine, I think I'll just go bang a hooker. Kill myself. I wish I wasn't born, I really fucking mean it. FUCKING KILL ME. I JUST WANT THE PAIN TO STOP. I am a waste of space and air"
"Whenever I feel moments of extreme anxiety usually brought on by the plethora of traumatic and straight up cripplingly humbling memories of moments of embarrassment I've experienced during my chaotic existance, I literally almost involuntarily say out loud to myself, ""I'm gunna kill myself"" or ""I'm gunna kill myself tomorrow"" even though I don't want to do it at all.

It's like a verbal tick triggered by anxiety inducing memories or thoughts and it's something I have very little control over.

Anyone else?"
"Is there a point you know it‚Äôs forever? Can someone with years of depression actually ‚Äúheal‚Äù and never experience depression symptoms again? 
I am fucked forever?
I‚Äôve been diagnosed 5+ years ago and tried different medications and therapists for long periods of time, they help temporarily but I feel like depression overall just becomes worse over time. It never goes away. What the fuck am I signed for?"
I can‚Äôt take it anymore. The loneliness. The sleepless nights. The crying. The vomiting. The living situation. The physical pain. The emotional pain. I can‚Äôt eat. I can‚Äôt find a job. I can‚Äôt afford therapy. I can‚Äôt afford to move. I don‚Äôt want to be here. No one else wants me here either. What‚Äôs the point of struggling every single fucking day???
"I died 12 years ago. But here I am, just drifting. I don't feel anything. No joy, no happiness. But even looking back now I don't think I have ever truly been happy. And yet here I am. I just keep getting older and older. I'm gonna be 19 soon. 19 years of this shit. Nothing to show for it, never had a job, a relationship, real friends. Nothing. At. All. The spark went out ages ago, I'm just here to fuel others, while I'm left here to drift for eternity."
"The hardest part about depression is that you're supposed to get yourself out of your own predicament whilst starting each day with 0 energy, motivation, or desire to live. If you can't find or muster the non-existent energy, people will watch you rot and die. None will go out of their way to help you. Some of them will even be glad because it will make them feel better about their own lives. They love the moment they get to tell someone ""Oh have you seen so and so, yeah, he's not doing that great, I heard he tried killing himself"".

People are always like ""There are so many resources out there, you don't need to suffer in silence!"". It's bullshit. The majority of people don't give a shit about your suffering. Humans are interested in self-preservation. None of the healthcare professionals I have seen have remotely cared about my situation or even believed the severity of it. I constantly have to go out of my way to harass them for certain results on tests, or to ask what the next steps are even though I barely have enough energy to get out of bed.

The only way out of depression is through yourself and your efforts, even though yourself wants to kill itself and you have 0 energy for efforts."
"i am exhausted 24/7. it feels like i‚Äôve got 100lb dumbbells attached to all of my limbs. if i sit down for 5 minutes i will go to sleep. i hardly eat anymore or take care of myself. and yet somehow everyone in my life notices this, and no one cares. if i were to kill myself, people would care. it‚Äôs always when it‚Äôs too late.

edit: i don‚Äôt want advice, this is just a vent post. stop fucking kicking me when i‚Äôm already down."
"its 6am. or, 7am now. sunday.

dad came in my room around 6;50, drunk and shit.

i was about to go to sleep as i have a fucked up sleep schedule. (been like this for 4 weeks. my pet of 13 years passed 3 months ago, still coping, grieving. depression worsened. u know how it goes.)

anyway, he came in my room and told me stay put and listen for 5 minutes, 'no anger' 'no lies'.

i recorded the audio coz i have a horrible memory and thought it was something important.

he yapped away, mostly focusing on himself, his feelings and needs. yapping away that 'im killing him', not the 'alcohol'. repeated that shit couple of times.

mostly yapped about the past. himself. with little regard of my own being and feelings, like he always have done since my 25 years of living in this shitty earth. since hes the emotionally unavailable father.

but anyway, in the yapping, i didnt want to listen at all coz i hate drunk people and was very uncomfortable, and 'froze', brain went blank. (suffered child abuse whenever alcohol was involved). but while he was talking away for 10 minutes, what caught my attention was this,

""when we lived at our old street in this town before we moved to this current street, your mother was pregnant with you. i had to stay put in town and take care of your brother, she had to go to the city to deliver you, alone.""

he yapped more other unimportant parts of the story. but what sticks with me the most, and probably forever, until i die, was this;

""when she arrived back to town, when i went to come see you... **i wanted TO BEAT YOU.**""

let me repeat.

**""while you were just a baby.... i wanted TO BEAT YOU.""**

i just looked at him when he said that. and had the fucking audacity to shrug it off. 'no, no no. its not like that now. i love you, etc'

then he said other shit to backpeddle that phrase, 'but when i saw you for the first time, i fell in love.' u know how it goes. since im his daughter. first daughter, only daughter.

u know how i felt? right there?

u dont. u dont know me. i still dont even know how to describe what im feeling about that phrase. that came out of his own mouth.

my own father.

after that, this also will stick with me until i die.

imagine its 6am, you're about to go to sleep, ur whole week was fine, even on this fine sunday weekend...and you hear this, from your dad, after 25 years of living, while you've been suffering with depression since 2012 and he knows u tried to 'unsubscribe' off this earth back in 2015, holding a knife, in ur room,

""when we made it back home, your mother called you **a mistake.**""

like, she just said it in a nonchalant way. 'a little mistake'. he phrased it the way she told it. so playfully, nonchalantly, like it didnt matter.

haha

.

so funny.

then he just dipped, after his 'talk'. left me alone with just that.

and then theres me, alone in my room. tired, needing to sleep yet processing what he just told me.

then i just almost had a mental breakdown right there.

my s---cde ideations have come back strong. cried a bit. laughed a bit i had to bury my head into my blanket

i was born with two demons.

two demons.

and i was just a baby.

only a baby.

haha

first, right off the bat,

i was a mistake. then a man wanted to beat me up. just because i was born.

haha...haha

i thought i was fine. its been great, these past 2 months, was just battling with depression the whole time.

but this, all of it just fueled the danger within me.

god created me, summoned me on this earth,

only to have two shitty parents say that i was a mistake, and the other, wanting to beat me up.

i still laugh at this.

theres literally no real love. on this earth.

there never was.

how can i 'just go to college', 'HELP MYSELF' after THIS?

how do u expect me to 'just help yourself, shape ur life, get a jojb, college, money' after this?

i dont know how to deal with this. this new information. it just made me lose faith in humanity even more.

im numb. yet hurt.

you people, on this earth, with good parents.......so lucky.

.

.

my father failed me.

my mother left me.

.

but, ill try to live. either way. even if i know i wont last. 

a new puppy of mine is gonna arrive tomorrow. is it stupid that im living for her? because of her? my puppy? to watch her grow?

without this puppy, if they hadnt found her on kiji, and after hearing what my dad just said,

i wouldnt be alive right now. that would've been the final straw. 25 years would've seemed like the perfect age.

anyway...

my brain, my mind fucking hurts. i suddenly have a headache.

gooodnight."
"Sleeping is truly fantastic.  While you‚Äôre asleep, you‚Äôre free. People say it‚Äôs like simulate death, but I think of it more like, a pause on life. Just a break. A moment where nothing can hurt you and you‚Äôre free."
" Never would I want anyone to go through the torture the mental health hell that I do. I seriously don‚Äôt know how or why I‚Äôm so still alive. I would think anyone who has gone through what I‚Äôve been through would be dead. If you are still alive after all this hell, please how do you do it? What keeps you going? Thank you"
"Recently after joining this sub, I‚Äôve realized that i have a functional depression. I still need meds and help and so on, but i can relatively function normally. Most people i know dont know about my depression. My question is why is it that way? Some people can barley get out of bed (which is me sometimes) while others continue to go on with their lives. Idc if this is dumb but im curious"
"My boyfriend (24) is all I ever wanted. Smart, caring, funny, understanding, gentle, knows what he wants to do in the future. I always prayed to meet a loving man like him. But now I understand how selfish it was to wish for someone I will never deserve.

I (20) am his complete opposite. Struggling with depression for 7 years, loser, no job and starting uni (my second time) soon. I have no money, I am getting further and further away from my friends, I am anxious and clingy. Not really good at anything because I spent my teenage years thinking of the best way to unalive myself.

No matter how hard I try, I will never be able to make up for those 7 years. 

And thinking logically, loving me brings him nothing. It doesn't matter that I take care of him and love him with my whole heart if there are days when I can't even get up from my bed.

I think that everything would be better if I killed myself at 13. Now, seven years later, everyone would already live their lives and forget about what happened. My friends wouldn't be sad because I ignore them. And my boyfriend would have someone better to love, someone who he truly deserves. Everyone would remember me as an innocent child without all those mistakes which I made later.

EDIT: Thank you for all the support. There's too much comments to be able to respond to every single one of you, but I read everything and feel really greatful. I'm better now. Thanks üíò"
I didn't ask to be born in the first place. l 
"I am really depressed to the point I feel physical pain.
I see my bed as a way to escape, 
I lay on the bed, I cuddle and cry to make myself feel better, but I have my tests. 
Everytime I tries to learn I just want to go to my bed.
I waste days without doing a thing except training in the morning, eating and reading book before go to sleep.

Any tip how can I deal with it

Thanks

Edit: I passed my test successfully, I am feeling much better now"
"Everything has gotten too expensive to live off of. Jobs underpay or just straight up don't hire no matter how much experience you have. Politicians screwing everyone over in every way. As someone eith depression, anxiety, autism and ADHD, I just don't see what's the point in trying to trying to live happily anymore."

"I was diagnosed with mild depression. I told my husband of 6 years (but known him for 12 years altogether) and his response was ""you should talk to your friends. I'm not great in giving pep talks. Understand that I can't help you."" 

I have no idea how to respond to that. I am a little bit upset. Is it a guy thing? Are they unable to handle big feelings of others?"
"A therapist told me during a very bad depressive episode that lasted about a year ""you can't be that bad if you're showering every day."" I was talking about how I was spending all day in bed only getting up to shower then crawl back to bed. I explained that I also have OCD and literally feel like I'm saturated in filth if I don't shower at least once a day (down from 3 times a day when it was really bad) It was the worst I'd ever felt in my life, I didn't want to be here, I totally lost my sense of self and was signed off work for 6 months but it couldn't have been that bad right? I was showering after all üôÑ Are these people actually qualified in what they do? or do they just do a two day course and go for it? "
"Genuine thing I can never understand. Everyone can live the same day and have no issue with it. They can live just fine doing absolutely nothing all day, everyday. People still have meaning in their existence just by sitting on their ass and doing nothing. I don't understand it.

Meanwhile I'm hoping a fucking plane crashes into my house and fantasize blowing my brains out through the top of the back of my skull. I feel like a shark, if 8m not constantly moving I feel dead. And currently I'm constantly doing nothing. I dread waking up and take melatonin during the day just so I don't have to be conscious. 

Someone end me. End my suffering "
"I kept looking around wondering why I'm the only one alone in the bar. How I get these people in my life and lose them like that. Each time they leave, it's a different excuse, but the truth is it's me. I'm just an unhappy person, a lonely person, to the point where you can smell it on me. You can see all the soft spots like some kind of disease. I stay quiet. I mind my business. I try to make friends without being noticed. It doesn't work. Now I'd rather just not be noticed. I'd rather be somewhere on the mountains soaked in quiet and cold. I could just stay there and shut up and no one would bother me. And more importantly, I wouldn't bother people. I hurt too much to have anyone more than me anymore."
"

I am depressed. And people around me are noticing it as well.

If I am honest about why I am depressed I know the answer. It is mainly because I lack sex and intimacy. 


I am not successful at dating. I tried dating apps it never works out. At the same time I don't feel like dating but I do feel like having sex. I thought about it but a prostitute would not give me the intimacy I want.

I am wondering if anyone feels depressed about lack of sex and intimacy as well?

"I (32F), feel like nothing makes sense. I have a failed marriage (he cheated with my friend) no kids, not good at my new job and will probably get fired too. I spend all my money just to survive despite getting an education and doing everything on the book. I have no energy and lost all my motivation, I keep seeing only wars, criminals, struggle, greediness, selfishness. I do love kids and would have loved to be a mother, but not in this world where I‚Äôm afraid he/she would suffer a lot. Not a question, just need some motivation. Is life good?"
"Honestly. I am a burden. When I reach out to you and tell you I'm depressed and you say, ""again?!"" and sound sick of me, yes I am a burden. And you are showing me that I am. "
"I know many people overcome depression by finding a hobby or an activity they enjoy but I don‚Äôt like anything. Not only because I‚Äôm depressed right now, but I‚Äôve been trying different hobbies through all my life and nothing appeals to me. Not even watching TV shows, nothing. So when someone suggests finding an activity I like to clear my mind, I just can‚Äôt. Plus, I‚Äôm at a point I can‚Äôt stand living. I hate everything, I hate talking, I hate listening, I hate going out, I hate laying in bed. I hate being here. It‚Äôs unbearable."
"This post is going to seem very self-centred and ungrateful because, ultimately, it is but I feel like I have to rip this off.

I have a great family and a wonderful set of friends but I feel like it's holding me hostage. I want to die the idea of being unshackled from this world to me feels like the ultimate form of freedom. This isn't a world I feel like I should be a part of. I offer it nothing of value as I simply have no value, and the world in its infinite cruelty has nothing to offer me either. A hundred years ago, natural selection would have taken me out long ago, but in the modern world I am forced to endure it. 

I can't end my own life because the negative impact it will leave on others who have foolishly developed an attachment to me will suffer, and I can't bear that thought. I know, however, I die will always have a negative impact on others, but I just wish I could die in a way that feels like it was inevitable. As if there was nothing anyone could have done to stop it. Unfortunately, that's just not how things work, and I must continue to suffer. Will this ever end?! I want out!"
"i guess I‚Äôm not actively suicidal since I haven‚Äôt made a plan, but i really want to be dead. i keep hoping something will kill me soon and all my pain can be over but it never happens. people keep telling me it gets better, like every day of my life since I was born hasn‚Äôt been an endless barrage of abuse and mental illness. autism and ADHD have no cure, only the latter has treatment, and they make my life so hard i don‚Äôt even want to keep trying anymore.

nobody would miss me if i were gone. i genuinely believe my best friend (the only person of note in my life) could just move on without me and find someone better. he‚Äôs going to university this September and he doesn‚Äôt need me and my problems holding him back from succeeding like i know he can. all I do is hold him back because he‚Äôs good at everything and i‚Äôm good at nothing (not an exaggeration, I burnt out academically and am a consistently average student, I have no hobbies, talents, or interests, i have no friends other than him) and i don‚Äôt want to be leeching off of him for the rest of his life. he has a brighter future and all i‚Äôm doing is ruining it. if i die he‚Äôll grieve for a while and move on and he‚Äôll be better off for it.

nothing in my life brings me joy so i just stopped doing everything altogether. i withdrew from my hobbies because they became chores (i didn‚Äôt even really have anything to begin with) and now I spend all day in my room, only leaving to eat and shower. the only thing that brings me any degree of happiness is alcohol but  1. i‚Äôm 15 so it isn‚Äôt like I can openly succumb to my alcohol problem and 2. I know my best friend hates when I drink so I try not to so he doesn‚Äôt feel upset about it. and self harm i guess but i have to stay clean for summer and it just makes me more miserable. 

right now he just texted me that he didn‚Äôt even notice i left the game server I was playing with him in before I wrote this. i really wish it‚Äôd be the same way if i just died altogether"
"I actually keep getting sadder as time goes on.

3 years ago I used to collapse randomly from depression and a lack of energy/willingness to keep standing.

It's started happening again."
"Wars waging everywhere, evil politicians, heartless billionaires, inexplicably getting rejected from every job you apply to as a degree holder when you‚Äôre trying your best... So can someone tell me why is this bullshit existence worth it?"
"I was fine before this relationship although I had a suicide attempt during my first abusive relationship.  there are times when my SO just makes me feel so awful about myself, and he wears me down bit by bit, it‚Äôs not even hitting or physical abuse, just little remarks here and there, and him constantly scrolling through models on facebook despite me asking him to stop.  I support him and his kids financially and I take care of his kids when he works, I just am so depressed and feel trapped and cannot get out of this relationship because of the obligation i feel towards supporting then.  I feel like killing myself is the only way out."
"""What are you depressed about?""

Stop. Asking. 

I don't know.

My brain is just fucked up, stop fucking asking me. I don't fucking know, and maybe I'll be dead before I find out."
"I've (F28) never had any relationship in my entire life.

 In fact, I've suffered from depression for several years and it's possible that I will kill myself in a few years.

 But I would like to be able to experience what it feels like to be with someone, and experience sex at least once in my life.

 But I know my condition will only push people away.  But I would like to know that to finally know a little about life.

 But to meet someone, you have to get better.  But no matter how much I go to therapy, it absolutely doesn't work.  And as long as I am not cured, I cannot begin this discovery.

 Since I have no future, I know I will never have a chance of experiencing that."
"I don‚Äôt even where to start, it‚Äôs 6 in the morning and I‚Äôve been crying for hours almost chock myself.
It‚Äôs all my fault if I have a daughter like myself i will also hate her. I used to be a no.1 honor student get all the A+ and now I don‚Äôt have any diploma and also not working. I got depression during university, failing all the classes and finally dropped out. The only thing i do is rotting in bed and listen to music. I want to change but didn‚Äôt know what to do, I am afraid if I fail again. I waste time and my parents‚Äô money. I really want to end my life‚Ä¶Dad I am so sorry your life will be better without me."
"Hello. I live in Japan and my father and mother are Japanese. My father and mother divorced when I was very young and I was raised by my father and grandmother. I am 18 years old and a senior in high school and will graduate from high school in March! I am currently receiving medication for depression with the help of a lawyer and living alone on the rental income from the hospital my father left me. In Japan, most young people go to college, and the university rank system is quite strict... I frequently think about death due to the pressure of exams. I am very worried that because I am ugly, I will not be able to make friends or be taken seriously because of my low academic background. But that's the case everywhere, isn't it...?
I am very afraid to live. Ever since I was little, my life has been a battle against bullies and school caste. I have had rarefied thoughts since the eighth grade and transferred to a high school that allowed home schooling during my freshman year of high school.
I feel like I am going crazy when I see sns. Many young people in Japan worry about their faces and consider plastic surgery from a young age. Too often we are judged by our education and appearance, but ironically, we are so lucky to be able to worry about every single thing like that.
I wonder if I should be living so idly on the inheritance my parents left me. I don't... Really... Afraid to live... I don't even know what I'm afraid of anymore.
I'm sorry that I'm having these shitty worries because I'm weak and only care about what people think of me, while there are so many people who are struggling to live their day."
"my sister was hanging out with me and my friend, and she brought up how she‚Äôs going to get a tattoo relating to depression. then my friend started saying ‚Äúdepression isn‚Äôt real, it‚Äôs just something people think they have when they have a bad life. all you need to do when you think you have depression is go to the gym, and when you start seeing results and get jacked, you won‚Äôt have depression anymore because you will see progress and that will make you happy and then you won‚Äôt have depression anymore‚Äù and said a bunch of shit that just pissed me off and i just didn‚Äôt say anything the whole time. then at the end he said ‚Äúso do you agree with me?‚Äù and i said ‚Äúno i don‚Äôt actually.‚Äù and he said ‚Äúwell what don‚Äôt you agree about? tell me what your personal definition of depression is. it‚Äôs just long term sadness right? so all you need to do is do things that make you happy. and if anxiety is causing depression, all you need to do is find out what‚Äôs making you anxious, and that‚Äôs it.‚Äù and i just said i don‚Äôt want to talk about this right now. and he still tried pressing me about it. so i said no im not fucking talking about this. and he stopped. but fuck i was so ready to kick his ass out of my house. telling a person with depression and terrible anxiety this bullshit. like do you think if it was that easy i would be struggling with this shit for years? you think this is my fucking choice? i fucking hate people. so fucking done. cant even talk to my own friend about my issues or he brushes it off saying it‚Äôs my fault.

"Amidst all the chaos and sorrow and suffering, looking around and seeing how alone you really are in the circumstances that you are in has got to be the worst feeling ever, it shatters my heart and it makes me incapable to do anything throughout the day."
"I feel like this for all my adult life, and every year it becomes worse. Basically I have nothing to live for, plain and simple.

No family, failed to start one.

Hobbies only help to pass time, not to make it meaningful. And trust me, I tried lots, and for a long time. 

Never found any meaning in all 20+ paid jobs I had, only a paycheck.

Volunteerings, same, still do but it never brought me satisfaction and happiness. When I'll stop, nobody even notices anyway.

Didn't find solution in religion either.

By now I mostly think that I'm just not suited for living, and mostly just hoping to due sooner. Such a waste ü§¢"
"I think that committing suicide would be the kindest thing I could do for myself. No more pain. No more thoughts. No more feelings. Just peace. It kind of feels like a dream to me. 
I used to believe in an afterlife, but this thought scares me now. What if there‚Äôs something after we die where our inner pain still carries onto? What if it doesn‚Äôt end with our death on Earth? I truly hope that‚Äôs not true. I truly hope that we‚Äôre just animals who will die and that will be that.
Killing myself would be the greatest act of self-love I could ever perform. The greatest form of protection for myself. If I die, nothing could hurt me ever again, and that‚Äôs something that nothing else can live up to; not any form or isolation, running away, or anything. 
One could call it selfish, but isn‚Äôt all self-love selfish? Is it really better to keep yourself alive solely for the people around you - usually the same ones that don‚Äôt make it a whole lot easier? 
Everyone speaks about self-love, being kind to yourself, protecting one‚Äôs peace. Well what if it means killing myself for me? That would be kindest thing I could ever, ever do for myself. "
"Went to a doctor appointment for depression and anxiety, basically called me a retard and said I can probably barely spell my name. And then I started crying and he said ‚Äútears get you nowhere‚Äù, yeah thanks, I forgot crying is something you just consciously decide to do. Basically called me a leech and a good for nothing bc I‚Äôm not working, and I‚Äôm a shitty person for depending on my family. So anyway, I relapsed hard. Would it be petty to attempt out of anger?

I‚Äôm so pissed, I‚Äôm literally one of the most intelligent people I know, just because I sucked at high school doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm a fucking idiot. And he basically treated me like nothing, I‚Äôm officially over trusting people ever. I said I wanted a stable job, and he basically just laughed at me. I‚Äôm so close to just killing myself since all my dreams and passions are apparently unreachable "
"I have been suffering from severe depression and anxiety for a couple of years now (26F). It is a struggle for me to do anything. I have been thinking of dying every single day of my episodes. I just cannot take the pain. 

And then when I meet my friends and hear about their lives, it just seems so unfair to me. I feel so dejected. It feels so fucking unfair that their problems are so ""normal"" and I have to struggle so much. 

I need a new outlook on this. the way I'm thinking isn't helping me. Is it even true? People say that everyone struggles but it just doesn't seem true anymore.

"Honestly I feel as though the emotions I feel are less so depression, but pure hate or spitefulness for just how genuinely awful both my circumstances and the world are. Ignorance must be a hell of a drug for people to blissfully ignore what is happening currently, and still believing it's moral to commit the atrocity of bringing new beings into this hell. How people manage to live out the most mindlessly repetitive tasks until one day they can't is beyond me.

It feels like an endless ocean with waves 10 feet high. Can't really blame people for being put into the same position and deciding it's easier to suffocate."

"F 27, felt like every day for the last 5 years has been the same and I don‚Äôt want to live anymore. I don‚Äôt want to have to work every day or keep up my appearance that I despise, I don‚Äôt want to have to go to therapy to get over years of trauma, I don‚Äôt want to have to put on this front to all my friends and family that everything is fine and they don‚Äôt have to worry. 

I daydream all the time of just taking every pill I have in my house, and then a ton of melatonin, and just putting on a nice playlist to fall asleep to. Id lock my bedroom door and by the time my day off was over and I didn‚Äôt show up for my next shift it would be too late.

I have talked to professionals, and will be starting my healing journey with a psychiatrist soon. I was told that there is a cure for suicidal thoughts, and can live my life free from them through intervention. I will update this sub in a few months about what I learned during this process to maybe give hope to anyone out there struggling like me.

"Everything keeps getting more expensive. The pizza I used to get last month for $13.99 now costs $16.99, so now just outside my price range. I don't care what anyone says. You need money to live in today's world. In some cases life truly sucks when you don't have enough. It especially sucks when you've been f'd in the pocketbook by greedy people. Can't eat anything. Can't do anything with my life and I no longer have the energy to change jobs."
"The hardest are the mornings. When I wake up, I‚Äôm like: OMG, not this sh1t again. It‚Äôs really debilitating.

"My chances of living a normal, healthy, happy, and loved life were ruined from my very birth. I wanted to do so much here. I wanted to see how breathtaking the earth is, travel around, get new hobbies, meet new people. And finally be the person I've always wanted to be. Someone who could prove the world wrong ‚Äî and heal from such a traumatic and empty childhood. Live a comfortable, happy life with a loving spouse.

And it's never going to happen. You can't live life when you're this.. broken.

This cruel cycle of biology truly just depends on your parents, or in my case, my single mother. Everything, down to the way you'd be raised, your living conditions, to how much their abusive behavior would affect you life long.

I hope some day I finally gain the courage to end all of this, there's really nothing and no one worth sticking around for. To be honest I've never really truly loved anything or anyone. It's inhumane. The more I stay here, the more it'll get worse. I'll soon take back what my mother couldn't."
"When I was a teenager, I had a traumatic experience that destroyed me. I went from being super motivated and ambitious to struggling to do anything. I had to repeat a year of high school because of it. College was a nightmare. Throughout those years, I made multiple attempts on my life. I got into a relationship that turned toxic which didn't help either.

And I feel like I'm floundering, because I feel like your teens and twenties are such crucial parts of your life - but throughout these crucial parts of my life, I was so depressed I could barely do anything. I didn't make any plans for the future, didn't do anything that could help my future self out, nothing. 

I've been doing better over the past year, but now the main source of my depression is what being so depressed during those formative years has resulted in. Everyone else my age is getting married, making good money, etc, and I'm living with my parents with no friends and am generally the family disappointment. That's not me beating myself up either. 

And I just don't know what to do. I've tried meds many times, but I always get weird side effects or they just don't work. I've tried so many different therapists, but therapy is so expensive and it's so hard to find someone you click with, so it just feels like throwing money down the drain. I keep trying to make my life better, and then I'm reminded of all I didn't do because I was too depressed to, and I fall into this trap of getting depressed about having been too depressed to help my current/future self out, if that makes sense. 

I keep trying to remind myself that during that time, I was just trying to stay alive when my brain didn't want to be around, but... during that time is when everyone else was taking internships and starting retirement accounts and making investments and generally planning for the future. So, now, their hard work is paying off for them, which is great. But it's just another reminder that I didn't do any of that, and sure, better late than never, but... it's just hard to not be angry at my younger self, even though she was just trying to stay alive.

How do you forgive yourself for all the time lost to depression? How do you forgive yourself for all it kept you from? This has become another source of depression, and I wish I knew how to handle it, but I don't."
"Just bought my first apartment. I never thought I will be able to afford one, I should be happy. I'm not, it feels like buying groceries."
"
The only con for this scenario would be that my family would miss me and y know be traumatised, and i would miss some of the very few nice moments in life, but those are clearly rare anyway and brief and almost always cost money which we get by doing stuff we hate, so its pointless? 

I also dont understand why people like life and take it so
seriously, its ridiculous man. Isnt this why we sugarcoat it all with religion to cope? I've had this forced down my throat. anyway, the pros to this scenario are that i get to skip a whole lifetime work, pain and suffering, and being in peace. 

 And always hear the same bullshit ""you have so much to live for"" or ""you've barely even lived"" or ""you have so much to experience"" like seriously? Experience what? More work? Worrying about money? Relationships? More stress and misery? At the age of 4 youve pretty much experienced all the good things in life atleast once so i think thats all bullshit, not to mention fun experiences im yet to have just cost money, especially nowadays things are getting more and more expensive, and that means getting your ass back to work monday to Friday, just to get that sweet relief on the weekend, only for it to just end again.

meanwhile some of us are out their not working at all and are chilling on their yachts, travelling the world, and doing whatever, that alone proofs we are all little wage slaves for the rich,  honestly its like revolves around work and im pretty sure it does.

i wish suicide could be socially accepted, ik that definitely isnt possible or realistic but i wish i could talk about my desire of it and not be treated like theres something wrong with me, like there isnt, i  just am able to see life for what it truly is, its ridiculous how people just crack on with ur and dont question shit.

"Ideally in high school, but I didn't have the willpower until college. I should've done it, 9 years ago. Nothing got better and I don't believe it ever will. At least back then I would've been a loss of potential. Now I'm in the world and everyone knows I never had any potential. A waste of money and effort. There's no point to my existence and every moment I'm alive I only waste more. My only regret is choosing life."

"28, unemployed, no meaningful current or past relationships to speak of, bad childhood, bad school experience, no fond memories to look back on, therapy doesn't work, I'm never gonna do what I want to do, what's the point? The only reason I'm still around is because I'm too afraid to kill myself. And as bad as not having a future is I'm more upset that my past has been shitty and there's no fixing that. I'm literally just a waste of space who keeps diluting myself into thinking maybe I'll do something someday and be successful even though that looks increasingly unlikely (also if my art fails I couldn't handle it.)

And I still find it hard to open up to ppl but I finally did to a friend and I feel a little better. I‚Äòll be honest, I still don‚Äôt like myself and I feel behind in life, but I‚Äôm gonna take this one step at a time. Again, thank you all for the love &amp; support üôè‚ù§Ô∏è"
"It truly is the toughest part depression. I don't recognize who I am anymore.

When I look in the mirror anymore I can see the physical changes that come from neglecting self care, but just don't care. Don't have the energy to care anymore. It seems depression took that too

Lost my ability to be empathetic and compassionate, so I'm just bitter about anything anymore. Anyone who tries to get close I end up lashing out at, whether I want to or not. People in my life are nice and don't deserve any of this. I have just degraded into and emotionless toxic person who is just awful to be around most of the time. I genuinely feel like death is the way to stop this downward spiral I've gotten twisted up in.

It's just an constant loop that feeds into itself and takes everything you love with it. It's left me as a husk of who I was."
"Saying that is wasting MY time and THEIR time.  Everybody knows it is bullshit and yet they say it anyways.  What is wrong with people?  It hasn‚Äôt gotten better for 11 years, so why would it now?  Nothing works, no matter how hard I try.  It is like they want people to feel worse.  Why lie straight to someone‚Äôs face?  Just shows how disrespectful and shitty someone is.  "
i don‚Äôt want to kill myself like how i used to want to kill myself because i simultaneously want to live it‚Äôs just that life is impossible. i can‚Äôt seem to fit in anywhere.
"Really makes me feel like such a loser, I don't have a partner not that I particularly want the romance part but it definitely doesn't make me feel any better about myself. I swear when I'm sad it's either, eat sleep or watch porn, and I'm sad alot. Really failing and just giving in to vices even though I know it's unhealthy. Wish I could just stop."
"I have 3 older brother who are all married with children. One got higher education and is traveling the world and making money. I was the last born and feel I didn‚Äôt get any support from anyone. 45 now, no kids, a marriage to someone who I think just married me for a green card, too late to meet someone and get pregnant. I only managed to get a 2 year degree. Family doesn‚Äôt respect me much. Had 1 abusive older brother, the one now who is super successful. Why life leaves me on the wayside? "
"It has become so common for people to say they‚Äôre depressed and want to die, that it just isn‚Äôt taken seriously anymore because most people who say that arent seriously depressed.

I am afraid to open up to people about my depression because I don‚Äôt want to be made fun of and accused of trying to seek attention or being edgy.
"
"I know depression might not make everyone clingy but I realize might did. Anyway, I was going through a rough time and that day I wanted to end it. Literally. That day, I was looking for a reason to live and my friend ignored me. I came up to him and ask him for reassurance that he cared about me. I was looking for a reason to keep going. But instead of reassuring me, he said that he will ignore me forever just to teach me a lesson??? Anyway, I had an emotional outburst after bc my distress was so great. It sucks. 

I miss you Vincent "
"I hate this life so much, I hate everything and everyone. We are being led by crappy lying leaders and we are seeing innocent people die the most tragic deaths for absolutely no reason. I myself am a failure, I‚Äôm just a burden on my family and I don‚Äôt bring anyone happiness. I try too hard prioritising others and I lose a piece of myself in the process. If I continue living, I‚Äôm just gonna be even more sad, even more in debt and even more of my relationships are going to break. I don‚Äôt want to live, but I don‚Äôt want to die. People say that ‚Äúit will get better‚Äù, but it just got worse? The hole is deeper than what it started as. I just want to live in peace and quiet, where I don‚Äôt have to worry. Just want to lie on the grass whilst it‚Äôs raining, and sleep. 

Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not going to take my life, but I‚Äôm just so sick of everything."
Every time I fap it‚Äôs all fun and games but the moment that I actually cum it makes me feel like such a big loser in life. Wasting time masturbating to the most weirdest shit. I even bought some photos from some random guy online just to fap to them. It seem harmless at the time but now I realize how stupid and ridiculous it was to buy something just to fap. Now I feel so empty after this relapse. I feel like a failure and it feels like despite this terrible feeling I‚Äôll always go back. But I just don‚Äôt want to anymore. I‚Äôm tired of being horny and watching porn all day consuming my entire life. To the point where I‚Äôd rather just stay in and fap the days away. But I always end up at the same spot. This feeling of dread and misery. I feel so disgusted with myself. I really want to stop this because this feeling is just so unbearable. It legit feels like I‚Äôm dead inside. I want to stop so bad I freaking hate masturbating it just kills my self esteem and self worth and reminds me how miserable and lonely I am. But I got nothing else going on in my life so stopping is even harder. I just don‚Äôt know what to do at this point I‚Äôm starting to think that maybe I‚Äôm just some special case and will never be able to stop.
"No one ever seems to understand or care that depression makes different activities difficult or impossible. If someone walks with a cane or has a bad back or diabetes or whatever people will cut them some slack when they don't feel up to something. Just because you can't see my depression (and actually you kinda can because it impacts how I care for myself and carry myself) doesn't mean I can just muscle through it all the time. I have a lot of physical issues too, but they are all minor...the thing is they kinda add up. For example I have arthritis. Not exactly a life threatening issue but when your hands and hips and jaw and elbows ache all the time it's hard to ignore. Combine that with major depressive disorder and anxiety and it's a lot. I have a demanding job and sometimes that is about all I can handle. People think i'm lazy or antisocial/rude because I often don't want to do social things. Even if I feel lonely sometimes I can't bring myself to be around people. I don't want to be this way. I am taking medication and the treatment has helped (it was life threatening bad years ago) but it is still significant. If you read this, thank you for listening. I needed to get this out and didn't feel ok talking IRL about it. "
"I don't wish to kill myself. 
I just wish I would fall asleep and never wake up. 
I've been through a lot. I'm 40 years old. I've failed at almost everything. 
I just wish to sleep and never wake up."
"I really do. After all being gay and as average in things that matter is so depressing. I am guaranteed I'm going to be forever alone - socially, romantically and literally my whole life. If I could wish I was different Id come up with many things and what I could have done differently, Id choose those moments when I've only met the failure of my decision making. But out of all things being gay hits the hardest. I very much know I am going to have nearly no friends for long time after I move from school. I'm going to never find any love, never I am going to love even myself. Even IF Id try my hardest and do everything in my power to be what Id really want to be. Id face the fact Id be 60 years old by that time. The time for person bored with life already is speed up. Life is short even without being bored. Once I blink one minute already passes. I'm going to never get familiar with other places other than my room and schools I've been in. I'm going to forever want to kms. I wished euthanasia would be legal. People would finally help me and support my wellbeing. I wish. But still it's a wish, not reality where everything and everyone is praying on weak. Jungle we know we are in that devours everything we love. We never changed a bit when humanity came from the trees and started to walk. It never changed."
"It's Sunday, the 5th of May 2024; 
the 15th and hopefully the last year of my pathetic life.  
  
I've been suffering since my childhood. My mother abused me mentally and my stepfather physically. I was always bullied in school for my weird behavior. I'm diagnosed with ADHD and Asperger's and can't talk to people at all. I felt like I was the whole world's laughing stock.  
  
I went to a lot of therapies for my social and emotional problems. Nothing ever helped. I was somehow always able to argue against everything that I was told to do. I already gave up by that point. I knew that I could never be fixed. And even if I got better, I wouldn't want to live in a world like this. Everywhere I look, I see nothing but misery. I've been told so many times how beautiful life can be if I just learned to see the positives in everything. It's like telling a colorblind person to ""just see the colors"". They don't exist for me.  
  
It's always been this way and I know that it always will be. I have no reason to put myself through this anymore. I'm not chasing any dreams, I lost my shot a long time ago. I'm not looking for love, I know that I don't deserve it. And I'm not looking for answers, they'll only hurt me. 
  
All I ever did was run. Run from the people, from my problems, from myself, from everything. And I'm tired. I got away from my family, but it changed nothing. I got addicted to weed and alcohol since then.  
  
I don't know why I'm even doing this right now. I'm just so fucking sick and tired of everything. 
I'm not doing this shit anymore.


 
  
Don't bother commenting. I'm only posting this to get a sense of closure. It just felt right to write everything down one last time. "
"I lived after I pulled the trigger. I don't know why, but it's probably a malfunction in the gun I used. (cap and ball colt) Just a click and a sec later went off and blew a hole in the roof and missed my head due to me being scared. I dident press hard and quick enough. I couldn't get myself to try again. I'm alive, and now I just sleep and smoke all day. I'm just waiting until I'm on my own so I can enjoy freedom. 6-8 months il be able move out, thats when I reach 18. I feel empty, lonely, and have nothing to love right now. I have no desire other than to live life in spite and be as unconscious of everything as possible. I just lie on the basement floor and smoke and loathe... regret... sadness. Even after working. It Dosent matter. 

I just cant wait to restart my life and finally be free for the rest of my young &amp; old life. But still more.... waiting. Many months of miserable waiting. Alone."
"I had a noose hanging in my closet since April. Today an amalgamation of emotions built up. I saw everyone talk about how happy their 2023 was while mine was filled with horror. I locked two of my social media accounts and I put the noose around my neck. The moment even the slightest bit of pressure was applied... I stopped and slowly took it off. And I'm still kinda feeling that pressure.

I don't know why I'm asking this. Maybe I'm in a state of confusion about what I just did."
"It‚Äôs not fair that I get no say in being here. I didn‚Äôt ask to be born. I wish I could ask my parents why they had me, like really. They wanted kids but why? Why did they bring me into this shitty world? My mom has said that I inherited her depression. It‚Äôs not her fault I have depression but I wish she would have considered the fact that her kids might be just as fucked up as her before she had me. I don‚Äôt necessarily want to harm myself at least not now, but I just wish I was never born. I think a lot of people here might feel that way too. It just sucks. I don‚Äôt want to be here. God it‚Äôs not fair I just wish I wasn‚Äôt born. My mom had a miscarriage after me and I just wish it had been me. I‚Äôm sorry, I just don‚Äôt know what to do and hate feeling this way. Just ranting I guess. Maybe looking for some solidarity?"
"Why is everything so expensive? I would have to work so much till I'm burned out again just to be able to save. Thinking about retirement is just depressing. I don't even wanna grow old anymore. Why are we letting money dictate the quality of our lives? Is this how it's supposed to be? I can't imagine working for 30 more years and maybe still not have enough after retirement. Why is it so hard to even just live comfortably?

"
"It's an empty promise. I literally have family members in their 60s whose lives are sad and / or wasted. One of them died after never finding true peace and happiness and being verbaly abused every day.

So what I'm trying to say is, for some people it just never gets better. Some people's entire lives pass by stuck in one place, stuck in poverty, with noone to love them. 

And telling people it'll get better for them might just not be true, and they start wondering what's wrong with them."
I am going to destroy my life when I obtain a weapon. They're illegal in Ireland but it's not difficult to obtain illegal weapons here. Don't bother with platitudes or advice. I've made up my mind. 
"I am 15M. I had a Abusive Mother who had molested me almost everyday during the pandemic. Thank god she is gone from my life. Even So ever since before and after the day she finally left. Everything seemed Pointless. Everyday was boring and repititve. Over the course from the beginning of the Lockdown and towards the end of Lockdown, my friends seemed to be more distant. Even when we got back to school, they just seemed like they got bored of me.

My Best Friend since grade school also betrayed me at the end of Middle School.

We were in a friend group of four with two other girls who were also my best friends since grade school. One by one they started to drift away and leave. All this stress from School, My mom, My friends and my family led me to attempt suicide Twice.

First by Hanging, and second by Jumping.

Neverthless, I lived to reach Middle School Graduation

My Girl best friend had moved away abroad after Middle School Graduation. Only my second Girl Best Friend went to the same High school as me.

I thought I was happy, with new people I met. But Even then after the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. Those people also drifted away from me and stopped talking to me as much. I thought I did something.

Around that time I started cutting almost everyday until I got caught and got scolded by my dad who yelled at me and lectured me that my life was at least better than people in Poverty.

He said It was a privilege for me to be sad and to Self Harm. The school sent me home for two weeks and left me with a warning that If they catch me Self harming again they would kick me out.

I got back after two weeks with people ""worried"" about me. But it was all A FUCKING LIE. THEY SPREAD FUCKING RUMORS ABOUT ME DOING IT FOR FUCKING ATTENTION AND WENT BACK TO ISOLATE ME. IGNORING ME EVEN WHEN I DID NOTHING TO PISS THEM OFF. EVEN MY FRIENDS FROM MY OLD SCHOOL STOPPED TALKING TO ME EVEN MY FUCKING BEST FRIEND WHO WENT TO SCHOOL WITH ME AND TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD NEVER REPLACE AND ABANDON ME, SHE FUCKING STOPPED TALKING TO ME.

I just wish to know what they are thinking. I want to stop feeling lonely. But its hard when everyone ignores and doesnt reply to my texts or calls. They only talk if they want something from me.

Its April Now, and Im tired. Freshman year is ending in a month, and I'm glad summer is coming. But I fear lonliness will be more present to me than ever. I think I should kill myself just one more time, I do not feel welcome anymore on this Earth, My family and my friends do not want me anymore.

I'm too weak for this shit. I hope I get to Hug God when I meet him whenever I decide to leave.

Update: I'm reaching my breaking point. I'm so close to giving up. I cant sleep, and Its hard to wake up. My dreams feel better than reality and I get hit with too much shit from reality. I don't want to die but the pain won't end."
"Pretty enough, smart enough, interesting enough, talented enough, confident enough, sexy enough, funny enough, enticing enough, skilled enough, attractive enough, loveable enough, enough to want to be around...

Just enough."
"Before you read this, please dont make fun of me, I am serious about what i am gonna do and was thinking of doing this for a year,and sorry for my bad english.

I dont want to talk about my problems, how ''pathetic'' my life is, how much i hate existing and  being who i am.

I want to die until the end of the week,if not the next 6-7 hours. I tried to buy helium, but it required ID, so painless death is not for me. I either gonna  jump from 14th floor or cut my veins and they both are enough painful for me. I am writting this for a strange favor: help me feel less fear of death and the minute pain that will kill me.

I was attending therapy and got pills prescripted, I drink them every day,so this is not a decision I make cuz i am depressed or sad. No matter how funny this can sound to you,  I am  happy thinking that im ending my life. So please..please,please,please  help me. Thank you"
"the past few weeks have been so hard on me. i went from actually leaving my house and doing things to staying inside and doing nothing. seasonal depression is hitting me harder than it ever has before. do people genuinely not notice when someone is depressed, or do they just not care? i only ask because my family is seemingly unaware of how depressed i am. is it just easier for them not to get involved so they turn a blind eye? or do i have a better poker face than i thought?"
We created a belief that having a will to live a life is positive and will to die is negative. What if you are stuck in the middle. No will to live or die. No will to take stand for life or will to end life. No will to get help. No will to accept situation. No will to exist in this reality. Wishing this life was just some random  dream of someone's sleep.
"I‚Äôve never been a drinker but tonight i decided to drink whiskey until I stopped feeling hopeless.

And this feels amazing. It‚Äôs almost like a lobotomy. I hate how good it feels. I don‚Äôt want to be an alcoholic but I want to do this again tomorrow when the depression comes back"
"My cousin who raped me told some lies to my Dad like He didn't attempted to rape me, he didn't hurt me.

He even goes on and tell lies like I bad mouth my step mom and my Dad.

My Dad kicked me out of the house this late night they even took my remaining money, I'm just wondering around the streets right now nowhere to go and breaking down, I don't have no one to talk to, I don't have friends because they all left me a few weeks ago because of rumors my friend spreads about me that I'm a liar and I thief, I didn't even do anything. But they believed her now I'm all alone.

I wish someone would just kill me right now. I'm really tired and has nowhere to stay. "
"You can say as many times as you want that therapy, excercises, medication and healthy food can help. And yeah, that's true, at least for some people.

But for me, I just know that something inside me is dead. A part of me that will never come back. Even if the depression gets easier or even 'goes away' completely, I won't be the same person ever again. He's just gone and not coming back. 

I don't really have any strong emotions about it since I don't have strong emotions about ANYTHING anymore. But it's still a little upsetting, I guess? It would be upsetting for my old self.

At this point I can only try to guess which emotions I am supposed to feel. 

Just gonna leave it here. Maybe someone can relate."
"I just want to go home and talk to somebody about stupid things, tell her about my day, about some silly struggles in my job and listening to her rambling about the same. Feel like I‚Äôm important to her and she can tell me everything. Being the favorite person of her.

I‚Äôm boring, I know that. I don‚Äôt have a lot of funny stories. I‚Äôm just an introvert who wants to love and be loved."
"2 days after the anniversary of my rape. 

i am not okay and i don‚Äôt want to be alive"
Ive been having mental breakdowns lately. Ive been burned out from work for the last year and now my relationship is turning sour. Im also in debt and pretty sure no one will notice that im gone. I cant believe that i just told myself that i wanna die already. What is wrong with me? Truth is i dont really want to die and would like to live a happy life but i dont where and how to start
I woke up feeling suicidal today. I just drank to push the feeling away. I wish I could stop drinking but I don't want to feel suicidal either. Really could use a friend or someone to talk to.
"I have nothing to my name, and I have no friends or nearby family. I work a low paying job and live paycheck to paycheck in a dull apartment complex by myself. Nothing brings me enjoyment, and I have no passion for anything. Just mentally exhausted from years of depression. Completely lost."
"My depression has been increasing over the years, I am 27 yo and my family does not take care of my grandmother, therefore they force me to live with her.


At her house I suffer psychological and physical abuse daily and my body hurts from having to serve her and clean everything she dirtyes every day (mainly the bathroom, she fills it with shit all the time).


I have a profession that I would LOVE to do so I can leave this place and have my uncles take care of her, but giving her attention and taking care of her takes me ALL DAY and I can't dedicate time to my personal life.



I've been in this situation since I was 20, I've never had a boyfriend, I don't go out with my friends, I just feel like a spectator watching how others fulfill their dreams and I'm still here crying because I can't follow mine. 


I know that no one cares about me and my absence would have no consequences. I am totally replaceable and will soon be forgotten if I die. 
And I'm not saying this from victimhood, believe me, it's a reality. 



The only thing that would give me hope to live is if someone magically lent me money to move and after being able to work in peace I would pay it back, but that won't happen so I'm determined to end my life.




It should be in 10 days because the method I chose requires buying something online and I also want to organize my room and belongings first.



I hope that y'all can be braver than me and move forward, I no longer have the strength to continue, I need to rest and stop suffering physically and emotionally.



Thanks for reading, I love you "
I‚Äôm a 31F who is just going through a tough time. I found out my bf 29M of 3.5 years was cheating on me with a 23F he worked with right before we were supposed to move in the house I bought for us together. We ended up going our separate ways but dated on and off for a year until I finally realized he made me feel terrible and I was better off without him. I dumped him last week and I don‚Äôt miss him but I feel really empty. I don‚Äôt want to start all over again with someone else. I live in a town with no family or friends nearby. I can‚Äôt explain how I feel but just so uncomfortable in my own body. All I can do is doom scroll on social media to try to keep myself occupied. I feel so empty and I want to end my life so I stop feeling this way. Has anyone else felt like this and did it go away :(
"Has anyone else experienced severe cognitive decline caused by depression? Loss of short-term memory, constant brain fog, struggling to solve basic tasks. I've been struggling with depression for several years and the symptoms continue to worsen. I don't know what to do, it becomes increasingly harder to do my day-to-day tasks and thus makes it harder to change any of the circumstances of my life that are causing me to be depressed, it feels like a negative feedback loop. Has anyone experienced severe cognitive decline and fully recovered? Is it even possible?"
I am an utter failure at life and have been fucked over and over by the people I love the most. Life has been painful from childhood. I just wanna end it all. I have given myself  2 more days cuz I wanna shift out of my sister‚Äôs place and then do it . Don wanna mess up her place. I wish that people were kind.
"Bed Rotting, fuck that shit. Feels crazy to me that such thing is even possible even if I myself experience it. How can you just rot in bed all day? Ignoring what your body ¬†needs, completely neglecting yourself just because you‚Äôre ‚Äúlazy‚Äù. It‚Äôs a shit feeling, wasting all your hours on nothing. But still is worrying about yourself and the things around you. For me it‚Äôs the overwhelming feeling of having to do something, drives me crazy. I need to brush my teeth, wash my face, take a shower, clean my room, do my homeworks‚Ä¶ Yet no matter how hard that want, that itch in your brain to do it. I still can‚Äôt, I FUCKING can‚Äôt. No matter how hard I try, how bad that feeling to DO IT. I FUCKING CAN‚ÄôT‚Ä¶ and it bothers you‚Ä¶ every fucking hour like an alarm clock that couldn‚Äôt be turned off. So you‚Äôre forever stuck listening to the sounds of your mind telling you to do those, but you never do.

"I don‚Äôt want to die. I want to get better. 


I reached out to my family but our cultural background makes them not treat my needs seriously. I went to the ER but I wasn‚Äôt immediately suicidal at the time so they just tossed me aside to a clinic where they gave me medication. It helped in the beginning but now I‚Äôm back to where I was. It takes at least 8 months to see a government funded therapist in Canada. I can‚Äôt pay for it out of pocket. I‚Äôve been cutting my thighs to feel something. It‚Äôs nice. I want to cut my wrists to feel even more but I‚Äôm scared I might die. I want to take all my antidepressants at once while drunk. But the fear of not succeeding and being left brain damaged is even scarier. I think about just impulsively jumping in front of the train. But there are too many horror stories of people not dying and just being permanently disabled. I want to do something that will leave me at the hospital but not kill me. Just enough for people around me to care.


I am so tired but I don‚Äôt want to die but no one wants to help me. How do I make anyone listen."
I told my friend I felt hopeless and she wanted to help but I just felt extremely annoyed and regretted saying anything it feels better to suffer in silence tbh
"Yesterday i took a shit ton of xanax pills and sip alot of vodka. My parebts found me got me to the hospital on time, i'm still alive i guess. It feels weird, i feel like i should have died and didn't. I don't where to start or if i should start anything i just feel to sick to kms again, because it felt weird af, but all my other options are painful now, still no hope, or enjoyment of life, any advice?

Edit. Thank you all for taking your time to reply and try to help me, i'll be reading and replying as many as i can"
"all i ever wanted was for someone, anyone, to like me. unfortunately that's not the case with me. nobody enjoys being around me. i mean who would when i behave like a 5 year old and have an ugly face and personality? all of my classmates have friends and friend groups, i have no friends at all. the one friend i did have ghosted me after knowing him for 5 years. 5 years down the drain because he preferred everyone else but me. even though im 17, im never going to get these years back ever again. never had a shitty teen relationship, never snuck out of the house to do dumb shit with friends, i haven't even had my first kiss yet. all i do is stay in my room all day playing video games and drawing. that's all i ever feel like doing with my life at this point and even these things are beginning to become boring to me. im so sick of this lonely fucked up existence. im not living, im just a dead man walking. i wish i could just be put down like a sick animal. it'll be way easier than continuing this stupid game called life"
I'm giving myself five days just in case it's irrational spur of the moment. If I still can't take it and it's still unbearable to live as myself I'm going to shoot myself. I just needed to tell someone. I'm Sorry. 
"I got so high last night that i lost control of my whole body. I could see and hear what‚Äôs happening around me but I cannot move any muscles. It was so relaxed that even my tongue felt like it was clogging my throat, I couldn‚Äôt breathe for a while. I almost gave up and was ready to end all of this. I was ready to die.

But my subconscious kept telling me to fight. There‚Äôs a feeling that everyone would be so disappointed in me if I die now at this state. I kept hearing my coach‚Äôs voice telling me to breathe. I started crying. I managed to sit up, vomit, and drink water. 

Luckily my girlfriend was there to help me ground myself. I kept asking for the time, i wanted to see the time because it will assure me that I didn‚Äôt die and stuck in a dream. I didn‚Äôt want her to see me die like that, while her arms are around me. So i kept fighting the feeling. 

The feeling that I was on the edge of dying kinda felt satisfying. But what happened was scary. Watching my girlfriend panic while trying to help me out feels like watching my death happen.

Today, I woke up feeling okay. Not even a hangover."
"Even those without mental illness experience so much suffering, how is almost anyone's life worth it? They go to a job they probably dislike for 8 hours every day, come home and do chores. A relatively small percentage of their lives is spent happy, certainly less than half. Those are the lucky ones. I think we evolved such a strong, deep seated will to live because without it too many of us would kill ourselves. Who wouldn't?"
"Sick of hearing ""you'll come out a stronger person"". No, the pure cortisol and stress flowing through my body makes me weaker, I'm to tired to even have a conversation. When I go to sleep, my heart is beating hard af from stress, when I wake up, my heart is heating fast. Even hearing a loud noise makes me terrified now "
"I'm not really planning on going through with it(I think?), but doing research, looking up equipment and imagining the process makes me feel like I'm finally in control of my life. If everything becomes worse there'll be always an option to go out on my own terms, and until that moment I can enjoy the few remaining things that make me happy"
"I've watched the movie a few times, but it wasn't until the last rewatch that certain things hit me. The way that Justine is treated by her new husband, how he expects things that make him happy to cure her depression. Being told that by pretending to be happy, you're lying to everyone. The way that when you're in the depths of a depressive episode, even things like getting in a car can be impossible. How everything tastes like ash or nothing when you're depressed. How, when everything seems to be going wrong for everyone around you, you're able to carry on like nothing is happening because now everyone sees why you're miserable.

The larger plot of the movie is a metaphor for depression, but Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of someone who's experiencing depression, who goes from ""functioning but depressed"" to ""can't function at all"" depressed, and the way people treat her made me feel understood in a way that no other movie's been able to capture. 

It's a dark movie, so if you're going to watch it, definitely don't do it in the midst of a depressive downswing, but it's beautifully done and absolutely gutted me so deeply that I had to literally lay down on the floor and stare at the ceiling to process everything."
"Peace, thanks for nothing, fuck this shit loveless life "
"I've been going through something where happy songs, movies, comedy routines make me cry. I can watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre and sit there numb; but if I try to watch Mama Mia! I am balling. Taylor Swift's Shake It Off is played and I am in tears. My depression is screwing with my emotional regulatiinnso much. Sad, dramatic stuff leaves me cold. But the happier the media, the more I cry. And to be clear I am sad crying, not happy crying. It has something to do with seeing joy that feels so unobtainable.

My friends and families say this makes no sense. Does anyone have similar experiences or symptoms?"
"I'm so sorry for what I'm about to do, I made a series of unfortunately unfair decisions that led me here. At least I wish if I could say sorry to my mom as I caused a huge amount of pain but I can't tomorrow by this time I will end this fucking suffering once and for all. Nobody will care enough about this Nobody 

Edit: I took my medication bottle and was about to do it, unfortunately I felt scared. Bot sure why as nothing changed but my body just froze and did not let me do it.
I hope that this was dor the best.

Thanks for your messages and comforting me in this way. Will see how things goes and I'm already having therapy with a psychiatric and have been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder will tell him about everything.

At least someone cares. About my mom she has cut me off so it's not possible to reach out."
"Shits way too hard by itself. Few years back I couldn‚Äôt understand why people would do something that would only destroy themselves with time. Now I do, when ur so low, who cares if u get even lower? Not like I could‚Äôve seen the light anyway. Anything to ease the pain, even for a little bit. I‚Äôll probably drink myself to death or fuck up my life some other way, got nothing left to lose "
"Even if by some miracle and inordinate amounts of hard work I manage to turn my life around now, I'm still crushed by the knowledge that I wasted my 20s doing nothing, gaining nothing. I might as well have been in prison for a decade. 

People will parrot empty platitudes: ""The 40s are the new 30s!"", ""When you're 70 you'll give everything to go back to being 30!"" But the truth is I let my sexual prime go by. I let what should've been the best years of my life go by. What's the point of starting over now? 

I don't actually *want* to die. I want a time machine. But in lieu of that, I'll take dying."
"‚ÄúDon‚Äôt listen to your brain‚Äù ‚Äústart thinking positively‚Äù do you know how HARD it is to not listen to you brain?! Your consciousness? literally YOU?! How hard it is to NOT listen to what your brain which is what controls you and makes me like this says?? Like genuinely people think they‚Äôre helping by telling me to get up and do something. I‚Äôm barely making it through the day without ending it all. 

But other than that it‚Äôs for sure getting worse. I cry at the drop of a hat. Every little bit of stress I think about suicide but even without it it‚Äôs all I can think about. I‚Äôm angry almost all the time and I‚Äôm meaner but I don‚Äôt even realize because I‚Äôm sorta on autopilot to. What did I do to deserve this? There better be reincarnation after death because I did not deserve this fucking shitty life. I want a normal one for  gods sake. "
"
One of the most intelligent people I know, has been diagnosed with bipolar. Had an episode of major depression, for two years and then a huge episode of mania for awhile. And then it went good as it never happened. I remember doctors said they never saw a comeback like that. 
Sadly, 9 years later, the depression its happening again. And its been more than one year. But this time the person, looks like it doesnt know how to do anything. This person doesnt know how to turn a tv on, or to do any basic stuff. And this is someone whose intelligence makes 10 of me or anyone rlly. Im wondering if this is because of the disease, or the meds/treatments. And if it can go away completely when the person gets back to herself. Because this is scary.
And Im sorry if Im sounding disrespectful, thats not what I mean fr , English is not my first language as you can notice.

"I never dated anyone. I'm getting near 30 now. I'll never experience young love. I'll never be the same as I was young. It was so easy to  have tried but I spent so many years pining for someone who didn't like me, so many years I didn't even try. It's not something I can ever experience again. "

I am tired and angry and the crushing loneliness and disconnect from humanity has never gone away. Even as a kid I never felt connected to anyone, ever. The moments of happiness I‚Äôve experienced with my son feel like distractions from the same fucking overwhelming hopelessness I have had for twenty years. When do I get to just give up? Do I continue to just stay alive because I don‚Äôt want to hurt my family? I know something has always been broken in me and I just can‚Äôt keep fighting and pretending for another twenty years.

"In about six weeks I‚Äôm going to graduate from college. Big university. Bullshit business degree. No leads on a job and no particular interest in verbally fellating some douchebag so I can get the ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù to spend 30 years in an office wishing for death. I just turned 29, I still live with my mother, and there is nothing left that gives me joy.

For years, I‚Äôve struggled to find a path. Community college, then university. Joyless. Worked in aerospace, in manufacturing, in offices and in the field. Burnt out every time. I don‚Äôt have the mental tools to be a real adult, either in a professional or interpersonal sense. I‚Äôm bad at making and maintaining friendships, and haven‚Äôt ever had a true romantic relationship.

When I was 5, I wound up in a psychiatrist‚Äôs office because I was having suicidal thoughts. When I was 16, I tried to jump off a bridge but lost my nerve. The only thing stopping me then was love for my parents. I am their only child, and if I died it would destroy them. So I kept on going, and over time the color kept draining from my world. At some point during covid, I just stopped thinking about the future. I can‚Äôt imagine a realistic pathway to happiness, just different ways to experience stress and loneliness. But I can‚Äôt leave my folks alone, what kind of monster would that make me? Does wanting to die mean that I don‚Äôt love them?

Then I had an epiphany: They did this to me.

They love me, and I love them. They weren‚Äôt abusive in any way. They gave me all the resources and attention I could ever have needed. But thirty years ago, they made a decision for selfish reasons. They wanted a baby. They struggled to get pregnant and bought all the baby gear and picked out a name. They went through all that and they never bothered to ask if I wanted to be here. They didn‚Äôt give me a choice, so I don‚Äôt owe them my existence. When a dog is in pain and living a joyless life, you put that dog down. You don‚Äôt force it to live in agony just because losing your pet would be too painful. I have, effectively, been a yuppie couple‚Äôs pet my entire life. I can‚Äôt feed or take care of myself independently. I have no purpose besides their happiness.

In six weeks, I‚Äôm going to walk across the stage and accept my degree. The final boss of my elongated childhood. The thing that middle class boys and girls must do to prove they belong in the club of adults. I‚Äôm going to smile for the pictures and listen to the speeches about all the places this piece of paper can take me.

Then I‚Äôm going to drive into the woods and eat a gun."
"The whole ""second chance on life"" bullshit is just that, bullshit. I'm trapped in a body I fucking hate, am stuck to live at home well past the point of it being normal, I commute to work and back every day and I feel like a fucking robot. I don't have anybody near my age on my day to day life, and the antidepressants aren't fucking working. I'm trying to get through but I feel like every day requires Herculean effort. I can't go through another holiday season. My sister is fucking perfect and I'm a complete failure in comparison and no amount of ""oh it's not true"" will make me feel better. Oh well, time to go into work and deal with rich assholes with better lives than me."
"Needed a place to vent because I have no friends. I'm female. Going to be 34 this year. Been a Christian for all my life and just this morning I gave up believing in God. I have autism and adhd. I grew up with drug addict parents. I was emotionally, mentally and sexually abused by my father. My mother was never there. Growing up was a challenge because I was alone. Now I live with an elderly family member who broke her ankle and now I must care for her. My mom lives with us. She's currently in the hospital for bone cancer. My sibling is also autistic. We also live with a narcissistic cousin who doesn't work and just wants people to kiss his ass. I know everyone struggles, but I feel so alone and I don't know what to do. I work and go home. That's it. I feel like my future will just be me caring for a mother who was never there for me. I just don't know where to turn to for help. I told myself if this year doesn't get better that I'm killing myself."
"I fully regret what I have done. 14 years old 2 weeks before I turn 15, I have done such a sensitive thing last year and even last month. I'm starting to realize like also a month ago.

I've been doing the DEED with my current bf. For like a lot of months and I'm glad we're both doing it safe but it feels so wrong. Like there's a cycle between us.

""doing it  - getting p**gn*cy sc""re - regretting it- doing it again"" The cycle will never stop.

And I'm very tired of it, I'm glad now I'm still safe. 

I planned to end things with my current bf right now because it's way too toxic and I just want to live and enjoy my  teenage days. 

I wish I could tell to my early 2023 self that rather to waste my time to that boy and losing the most important thing, I should enjoy my time doing my hobbys, exploring my talents, finding a new hobbys, enjoying time with friends. I FULLY REGRET IT.

Also the reason why I want to end things with him. It's because he has done a lot of terrible things to me. He ignores me a lot just for a game, He is also a liar, He also keeps on asking me for money üòü even the most cheapest thing. Also if we're together instead of talking normal he also keeps on talking when and what will he do when we will do the DEED again( this is the most shortest way to explain what he had done).
 I asked him to apologize to me but instead of apologizing. He blamed me. And I had enough. It took me 1 year  and 5 months to realize all of his sh*ts. 

Now I'm wondering someday in the future if someone will still accept me for who I am now and if no one then I'll live alone and that's fine.( But before that I'll focus on myself and my dreams first.)


Ps. I still remember that time I used to cry every night for 6 months because of him and that caused me feel numb and now I can't even cry idk 

Idk if someone will bother to read or comment but if u don't have anything nice to say better to ignore this post. I just want to let it out. That's why I posted. 

In advance: no one shall post this on any other platforms."
"My life has been nothing but trauma and pain. Sounds selfish to say that but I barely even care anymore. 

My selfish bitch of a birth mom got pregnant and decided to drink and dope herself out, fucking my brain up a bit. Then her boyfriend decides to rape me regularly for 4-5 years. That along with the physical abuse, screaming, and neglect really did not help. They barely ever washed me. They fed me a plate of donuts until I threw up. They pushed me down when I disobeyed. 
Once I reached 5, some neighbors found me locked outside in the snow. I entered foster care and don‚Äôt remember much. I get adopted finally, leaving those sickos behind. Jump ahead 4 years, they find out I have an emotional disorder.
 Me freaking out, getting angry, and finally getting suspended from school. By this time everybody at school hates me. I let myself go and get fat. Years go by and I develop depression, anxiety, PTSD, and a drug addiction. I become the stupid ass emo kid everyone hates. I try to kill myself multiple times. High school comes around and I start getting better, but my adoptive dad has decided I‚Äôm now old enough to beat. I steal shit, run away for a month or so, come back and now I‚Äôm grounded from my truck. Things go fine, now they‚Äôre back in the gutter.

I absolutely despise life with a passion. What is even the point? I‚Äôll just become more miserable. I‚Äôm too much of a pussy to kill myself anyway, I need to know how to overcome this fear."
Anyone else feeling this way? What's your plan to overcome whatever shit you're going through?
"I hate smoking, I hate being high, I hate tripping out, I hate it so much! But it's the only way I can be my old self. The me that my friends knew in highschool, the me that my coworkers know and enjoy, the me that my family enjoys. I used to be happy but now I need to be high or drunk just to enjoy being around people or just to keep myself from killing myself. I sit for days and hours asleep and wasting away because I am stuck in bed depressed and just lost in my own emotions. I want so badly to be able to let all of this go and just exist again but life isn't made like that. The day I stop using weed to cope and alcohol to manage is the day that I will kill myself. I hate that this is how I live now. I hate everything and I hate myself."
"I‚Äôve (17, M) been talking to a therapist about the general feeling but- I‚Äôm so confused- It‚Äôs like the extreme opposite of the spectrum to wanting to die, I‚Äôve literally ended up catatonic over my own mortality and I really just want a name to put to it."
"male 36, depressed since 15. I have severe depression and severe back pain issues. I cant hold down a job due to my mental state and i suffer a lot. basically I dont enjoy life and I am desperate. Every year my health worsens and I feel like I am dying. Any tips please."
I don't understand these non-depressed people who keep track of posts on this sub just to harshly criticize people. Do these people really think that's a smart thing to do with people on the verge of their breaking point? Or are they just sadistic?
"I'm 23 and my life feels so pitiful. I have no way of getting support besides my weekly therapist sessions, which just isn't frequent enough. I've been feeling really depressed at my lack of friends and I just don't know what I'm supposed to be doing differently.  
I had friends in college, but many of them moved away, or just stopped inviting me to things after graduating. The only time those friends ever reach out to me is when they need help getting a job or something. I have a closer knit group that I hang out with now of 3 other guys (2 who I live with), but I haven't been happy in that circle. I feel like I'm the least liked friend in that group and I find myself having to change my personality because I know my authentic self wouldn't be accepted by them. These are the only friends I have.  
I feel like they never have shown much appreciation for me as long as I've known them. I went to Japan and bought them souvenirs to show them that they mattered to me even abroad. But those same friends barely even asked about my trip or cared to hear any of my stories. In fact, I spent more time hearing what they did altogether over the weekends I missed being abroad.  
It just feels like no one in this world will ever see the value in me. And I'm starting to wonder if it's because I don't have value to offer. As others on Reddit have said when I've asked for help, I'm just a friendless loser. I'm better off dead. I have no one but my parents. And they're starting to get old and I have doubt I will be able to continue living on without them."
"I turned 27 in late October and my life is a failure. I have no friends, I've never dated, I have a terrible seasonal job, and I'm dependent on my parents. I've totally failed for someone at this age. Many people my age have gotten married and have careers not crappy seasonal jobs. I'm in the bottom percent on so many basic aspects of life. Bottom percent on still being a virgin at 27, bottom percent on having not one friend, and bottom percent on yearly earnings. I have avoidant personality disorder and people are repulsed by my over it or my ugly face. I have a five year old IT degree that's providing zero value to me while I work manual labor jobs. Even if I could make decent money and move out and gain actual adult skulls, being so socially isolated would be excruciating. I'd end up a hermit in an empty apartment with no life outside of work. At least I have my parents even if the environment is toxic. I'm doomed. "
"I used to be obsessed with all four sports, talk radio, music, movies, and just playing around online. For the past 5 years I've gradually lost interest in everything and this past year has been real bad. I'm basically down to the NFL and I fear it won't be long before I no longer give a damn about that either. 

I've tried to replace these things with new hobbies or interests but it all seems like a waste of time. Like I'm just doing it to do something. A time waster  isn't a passion. 

I've been to therapy and I'm currently on antidepressants for anxiety mainly but it's obviously supposed to help depression.

It's kind of scary, I mean, I literally wake up with no joy. Nothing to look forward to and I don't know how to turn this around.

Has anyone experienced this? WTF do I do? "
"Sorry if this is really long, also marked NSFW for involving suicide talk (15 M) Ever since I could remember, my life was amazing. My parents were a happy couple, I was homeschooled, had little to no responsibilities, had a homeschool group of friends, life was good...Up until I turned 13...

A few months after I turned 13, I noticed my parents fighting a lot, they did fight in the past but not very often. The fights got more and more intense and turned into screaming matches, I would be huddled up in my room comforting my siblings as they cried, while I was trying to figure out what they were talking about.

On my parents anniversary, my parents friends came over (via request from my mom) without my dad's permission, to talk about my parents marriage and see if they could help. My dad hates surprises so he freaked out and went down to his computer in the basement after yelling ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS FOR?!?!"" My mom started crying and went to hangout at their friends for the night. This is where everything went to hell. My dad told me later that night they were never a good couple, they always fought, we just never heard them.

They tried some counseling sessions for a month and nothing worked, frankly I think it made it worse. Eventually my mom started causing trouble, telling my parents friends all the bad things my dad in their marriage, but not saying a thing about her part in it. My friends believed her and she slowly turned all my parents friends against my dad.

Fast forward a few months my mom is living in the basement since she can't move anywhere else as of that time, and my dad is in extreme depression, after losing all his friends to an unjust cause, and failing at fixing the marriage. I start experiencing depression and start becoming suicidal. My dad start dating a woman since my mom refused to sign divorce papers yet.

My mom eventually starts provoking my dad, saying things she knows triggers him, and starts calling the police whenever he slips, even though he doesn't mean it. One night my parents had a talk and my mom agreed she would not record the conversation...Sure enough, she did. This led to my dad threatening by saying he's gonna hire a junkie to have her killed.

After that night while my dad was at work, she called the police and had him arrested at work in front of all his co-workers, embarrassing him and he was fired on the spot. My dad was in jail for the night, but his girlfriend bailed him out, and he moved into her apartment.

Eventually after some court stuff we were allowed to visit my dad once a week.

This is where I was the most suicidal, my mom made me the dad of the house, forcing everything on me, chores, punishing my siblings, cooking, while my mom would just sleep/Hangout in her room, barely working her part time job. She would mentally abuse me, comparing me to people she hates, punishing me for the stupidest things, and not letting me leave the house. I started realizing my dad just wanted peace in the divorce, while my mom was out for blood. Eventually after some court stuff we were allowed to visit my dad twice a week. Though that wasn't enough. Eventually I set a date for  myself on my calendar, so in a week I would commit suicide. 

Then I came up with an idea, I would pack my bag and bring it with me the next time I go to my dad's, I would tell him I'm staying with him and I wasn't going back. He was completely fine with it, he put me in a school, and the court said my primary residence would be with my dad, due to education purposes. So since 6 months ago, I have been living with my dad, his girlfriend, her son and her daughter, and her dog. And my mom refuses to give up this needless fight, and I don't think she plans on ending it any time soon. (Again so sorry if this was long, I needed to vent:/"
"I don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôm a real person lately. Idk why. Maybe it‚Äôs dissociation or however you call that in english, maybe its me isolating myself or maybe it‚Äôs the world just not seeing me as a human being because i don‚Äôt fit into society in a conventional way. No matter what the reason is, I haven‚Äôt interacted with people in months. Like literally. I say hello and goodbye to the cashiers at the grocery store but that‚Äôs about it. I have no friends, literally zero, not saying that for attention i just genuinely am alone. And i‚Äôm not on great terms with my family so i don‚Äôt really talk to them either. It‚Äôs just me, myself and I, and it‚Äôs going downhill‚Ä¶ This post is probably gonna get lost into the void lol but if someone read this far, i hope you noticed me. I hope I‚Äôm frickin real."

"People dont deserve to be living. They kill, lie, rape, cheat and more. I believe our earth will be best without humans. Even though they are some good people but many people have many dark side even me."
about 3 years ago I was making great money and my wife was working at a well known cable company. my health took a turn and I was diagnosed with a form of congestive heart failure from scar tissue on my heart that formed from an accident that happened when I was 16 (im 31) where I was nearly fried to death by 480v. I had to have an oblation to sever some of the scar tissue that was making my heart beat improperly. any unnecessary strain I put on my body makes the scar tissue grow more so I had to quit my dream job as an arborist and started my own company. we made an agreement that since this was the case she couldnt quit her job or do anything that would jeopardize her position unless she could get all of her credit cards paid off and already had another job lined up. 4 days after i made the transition to running my own company she went on loa for no good reason and dove head first into a bottle. she hasnt paid any of her cards off so I have been paying close to 5k a month in interest absolutely negating any money I was making (she thinks by paying that interest every month that she is building credit) on top of that she has pulled out several loans that I am now responsible for paying by default. she has spent every dime that I had put back to pay my taxes so now the IRS is coming after me. she has refused to find a new job and cant go back to her other one but they wont technically fire her (they want her to resign so they dont have to pay unemployment) i need another operation or im going to die but I cant get it because our health system in the US wont deal with me without the insurance I used to have through her work. Im broke financially and physically and cant even afford to feed my cats and dogs much less pay my rent and she doest seem to care the slightest. I cant even afford a divorce.

I've got a lot to be thankful for.. health, loving family and friends, hobbies. But I wouldn't say I love life. One of the reasons why I never really wanted kids is because I don't think that this life is worth living.

How do people come to terms with life? Do people that love life have something which I'm missing? I understand that my breakup earlier this year hasn't helped me with having a bright positive forecast... but I didn't really think life was worth living even before I was dumped.

I fail to see why anyone would want to live in this world and have this life... and I have it well off. I'm super lucky to be fortunate and health - for which I am super grateful; I definitely shouldn't be one to complain. But yet, I still don't think I love life. "
"hello everyone. this is a follow up post to a post that i made about a month ago. the situation, even though i took all of the advice that i got, did not improve. it worsened and i dont know what to do. im really lost and scared.
to sum up the last post that i made, my boyfriend (20) has been feeling like his whole life is a waste and like he doesn't exist in anyone's life. he feels that he wasted his teenage years and that life won't get better, only worse, with all of the responsibilities that life brings. he doesn't want to grow old and doesn't want to accept the fact that all of his life was just emptiness. no good memories no bad memories just emptiness. no experience / no new memories in the present nor in the future can help him change the way he sees his life. it is all a waste of time and he doesnt want to continue living in this agony.

i took all the advice that i got. i am always there for him, im here to listen, im checking up on him, encouraging him to go out, to do things with me, to do things he enjoys, i help him take his mind off things, i am optimistic but not in a overwhelming way, i always understand everything he says. 

i surrounded him with new people who like him, i spoke to him about plans about the future or some trips we could take in the near future to change the environment.

i got him to go to a psychiatrist, which i all planned out like advised, but he didn't like it. the psychiatrist didn't even listen to him, was basically a bitch towards him and the whole appointment lasted for about 25 minutes because they fucked up the appointments. he took this as a sign that  even people who are paid wont listen to him. 
he doesn't want to go anymore. not to that clinic  not anywhere. doesn't want to waste money on himself anymore, refuses to take my money to go. public clinics are off the table for him. 
because of this he cant get any medication prescribed. at this point, i think that he wouldn't even take it if it was prescribed.
i told him to talk to his friends that i know love him dearly, but he refuses. he is 100% sure that nobody cares for him and that ""nobody would even come to his funeral"".

he said that he can't enjoy anything anymore and that his brain is full of thoughts of his wasted life and if anything nice happens, all he can think about is ""why didnt this happen earlier"" or ""what did i do to deserve this life""

he gave himself another week. i wouldn't be writing this if i was not 100% sure that he would do it. this is not a cry for help. this will happen if i don't do something to help. and i dont know how and what to do.

i cant call the suicide prevention line on him because it wont do any good. i cant do anything my hands are tied and i dont know what to do. please tell me how to help him. any advice is appreciated. thank you. 

 im sorry if some things i wrote did not make sense im just scared."
"I am a suicidal 28 year old man. For as long as I can remember, I've been suffering. I have never truly had ""friends"", maybe only people I've called a friend, but in reality I've been terminally alone. Dad was also abusive to me as a child, used to throw me around and beat me and stuff, and my mother has been absent for most of this life too.

At the age of 26, I got into a relationship with, and lost my virginity to, one of the most amazing and cruellest women I've ever met in my life. She'd deliberately hurt my feelings to fuck me up, lied about being drugged and raped to trauma bond me, constantly fed me lies about who she was as a person, etc. I wasn't always the best to her, in fact I have severe insecurities and I was never the best. But she fucked me up even worse than I was before, and I hadn't ever told her or anyone in my life how badly I was suffering. It just ended terribly too. She'd called me boring, woeful. Which is all true to be fair, I'm a boring and woeful person by default, I've been that way since I was born.

I'm also autistic which sort of makes the pain a million times worse. It makes the pain so much worse. I can't connect with anyone, I can't have friends, I can't ever be in a relationship because the damage is so bad and I've never had a point in my life where I've been whole. I'm just utterly broken and a trainwreck.

At this point, the suffering has reached critical mass. I can't do anything, won't do anything, and I feel like I am on the verge of death. I can't think of anything without it not just reminding me of my ex, but how alone I've been for my entire life. I can't think of anything or do anything without it reminding me of how I'll never be able to create something I can ever enjoy. I have suffered for a lifetime. I've grown tired of pretending to be content. I'm sorry I couldn't have been more, but I have nobody to be sorry to, not even myself because I'm that worthless. I'll never EVER be special. Nobody will give a shit when I'm gone, but that's okay by me. I don't mind leaving my abusive father and neglectful mother behind."
"

It's tough typing this out, almost 4am, I've lost my best friend, and I'm at a loss myself. We were both immigrants here in Europe, left our home country for what we hoped would be a better life. But, honestly, it's been anything but.

We faced racism here more than we ever expected. People have racism ingrained in them, we were truly alone in sense that no other friends, the locals looked down upon us and how we were told these people are civilized, looking for apartment or any place of accommodation as a person of color is a nightmare, we had people reject to our face despite having proper documentation and funds. Women are also so shallow, somehow they are okay with our looks yet when they find out where we come from their racist self awakens, all of a sudden we're creeps. Me and my friend never got to date, woman took one look at us and said ew..

We used to confide into eachother about maltreatment we face in this society.. how people like us don't belong here but neither back home. 

My friend, he was not just my friend he was more than that, really. He was like family. The only one who truly understood the weight of what we were carrying because he was carrying it, too. But it's been harder lately. The discrimination, the loneliness, lack of funds, sleeping from one place to another... it broke him, and I saw it happen. The man who never showed weakness, cried in front of me, said he couldn't take it anymore. That's how deep our struggles cut.

Now he's gone, and I'm here without the one person who understood everything I was going through. I'm facing these challenges alone, and I'm not sure how to handle it. The pain, the loss, it's overwhelming. He was my confidant, my support through all the ups and downs we faced in this foreign land.

Everywhere I turn, it feels like there's just more judgement, more isolation. I'm tired of being seen as just an immigrant, tired of the empty words about equality and fairness that never seem to apply to us. My friend was the one who helped me hold onto hope, but now he's not here, and that hope is harder to find.

How does one find hope in a world that seems intent on extinguishing it?"
"I can't even create a post using the word S\*\*cide anywhere, if you tell anyone your seriously considering it they either lock you up or just think your pathetic and lying. no serious conversations can be had.. advice? personal experiences?"
"I'm 40. I've been depressed my entire life. But things have changed. I used to think I would never be able to find someone to marry me, I'd never have kids, never make enough money to save a dime. Now I have all that. A husband. Three kids. A house.

And yet, I spend most of the week thinking about dying. Disappearing. I won't do anything because I don't want to mess up my kids. If they weren't around I probably would. But since  I can't, I so want to be less miserable.

I have ADHD. My house is a mess. I am so overwhelmed I don't know where to start. I have savings so I won't lose the house overnight, but based on our income we really can't afford it. We can pay the mortgage but not to fix it up. We rent the master bedroom to my FIL and I live in the living room next to the kitchen. There is no privacy. I can't invite people over. Not that I would want to the way this house looks.

I am not good at my job. I've been fired many times. Some of it is just I really can't do the job, some is I get overwhelmed and panic and freeze. I want a different career but don't know what to do. Any other job would pay a lot less and would require schooling. I had no faith it would be any better. I'm bad at working.

My husband works like 1/4 time and watches the kids. They are safe and loved, but I wish he would take them out during the day. I wish he would schedule doctor's appointments. Or actually read the school emails and know what's going on.

He doesn't understand money. He is fairly frugal, but he also doesn't want to move to a cheaper area. He refuses to let me buy a $35k minivan and says either we buy the $55k hybrid one or wait. I tell him we can't safely drive 3 kids in a Prius. He doesn't listen to me.

My husband isn't attracted to me. I've given up initiating. I've been susceptible to the slightest attention from other men who just want to use me and throw me out. But any attention is better than nothing.

I just want to dig a hole and hide. Im not allowed to talk about anything serious until after New Years. I am so stressed. I really don't know what to do. I really think disappearing would be the best but again I can't do that to my kids. That's not fair to them. How can I just be less miserable and more in control of my life? I feel so so alone."
"I was in a motorcycle accident a couple months ago and lately all i can think is ""fuck i wish i died in that accident"", an i cant stop, i feel like everyone is jus tired of my depression and dealing with me when i get low
Fuck i wish i was dead, life is pointless, 
I dont know what do anymore, my wifes noticed ive started to withdraw emotionally. Im jus caring less about everything everyday. Ugh.. i jus wanna not wake up one day.
Death is not something im afraid of anymore, when you die you jus die, i wont remeber even being alive so why be afraid."
January can‚Äôt come soon enough.
"I wear the same clothes for longer and working from home allows me to get away with it. I haven't showered for four weeks,  only being in a swimming pool at weekends with the kids. I stink, and I have found myself actually enjoying not caring. Its like a protest against people with happy lives except I lose every time. I'll also not shave for much longer.

I wonder if there's anyone else like me

"
"last month. she had cancer stage 4 but what killed her was the chemo, her body couldn't handle it. she ended up in the UCI and died shortly after. 

I'm obviously grieving, which has been extra hard considering the whole depression thing. I'm taking my pills so that helps, but I'm an intern on a hospital and seeing the machines and sick people just makes me remember those days at the hospital with my mom, how much she suffered, how sick she got. she couldn't even speak. it hurts just to think about. 

im finding it hard to deal with life rn. it sucks so much. it's so fucking unfair. i'm gonna keep going bc my mom raised me so i could live and i will make her efforts worth something, but it is so fucking hard. always was, for me, but now it's even worse. i wish someone could help me, but I've never been more lonely. I don't think anybody could help, either way. I miss you mom, you made the grey days a little more colorful. I don't know how to deal without you

I'm not gonna do anything, bc my dad's still with me and I would never leave him alone, but I keep getting these ideas about dying. about how much I want to die, even though I dont want to kill myself. I just want to not wake up. I have to remember myself to eat. I'm showering too much. I'm not folding my clothes. I don't care about things I cared about before, and I dont know if it's normal or if it's part of grieving or just my depression acting up. i just try to make it one day at a time. it's hard."
"

I‚Äôm 41. I remember a time when I was excited for the future. In my 20s and early 30s I had plans and hopes for what I wanted out of life. I wanted to design games or write books. I wanted a house with a big piece of land so I could grow a big garden/food forest thing and maybe keep bees or animals. I wanted to be married and have kids and see them grow up into interesting people.

Then I started dialing back. 


I‚Äôd get a job writing about games. I‚Äôd have a little two bedroom house with a small back yard where I could have a little herb garden, some zucchini or something. A wife, a kid, a dog.  Still decent.

Dial it back some

Ok. I‚Äôll work my call center job but I‚Äôll have a blog or something where I write about my interests. A decent apartment with a patio. And some fruit and veggie plants in flower pots. My girlfriend and a dog.

Now the only dream I can realistically imagine for myself is one where I‚Äôm alone. I work my unfulfilling call center job. I live alone. I don‚Äôt have friends to hang out with. I don‚Äôt have anyone in my life so I can‚Äôt disappoint anyone else. One bedroom apartment. Studio maybe. And some time before I get too old to make it to the bathroom by myself I end things.

The only happy fantasy I have is a recurring daydream where I didn‚Äôt fuck everything up. I stayed on my meds in high school and graduated and went to the college i wanted. I dated the girl I liked because I wasn‚Äôt so afraid of rejection that I never asked her out. I got the job I wanted, the house, the homestead, the family, the friends. But that life only exists in daydreams and I can‚Äôt imagine how I‚Äôd ever make it real at this point.

My shoes are too tight. But it doesn‚Äôt matter, because I‚Äôve forgotten how to dance."
"I use to be in the top of my class, loved going to lessons to learn new stuff. I use to have hobbies learning new languages, I was decently good at art and I wanted to get better. I liked talking to people about random things I saw online and shit so why did I have to ruin my life and get depressed. I don‚Äôt even know what happened everything was going fine I was decently fulfilled, yes I did self harm but that was rarely, I enjoyed being around people enough to not feel suffocated when having a conversation. I literally hate how I let myself get this bad like I should have at least waited to be so fucked up. I should have waited just until my education and life was together to ruin it all. Why have I fucked up my life."
"I'm 28 and I find myself weeping at the littlest things. I am unable to deal with anything that comes my way, I just take it and spiral down into self hatred.

If I were intelligent, I'd be able to deal with things, find solutions, know how to answer, know how to take responsibility. Instead I act like a goddamn baby and weep.

I really hate myself."
Sometimes I wish I could start my life all over again. Like from a baby but with my same memories now. There are just so many things a wish I could undo or just do differently cause my whole life is filled with regrets and fuck ups.
I don't know why I'm bothering with these things. They don't do shit and I can't drink as much as I used to on them. But being drunk feels so good and my only thought is I wish I were drunker. I honestly don't know how people don't become alcoholics. I won't touch hard drugs because part of me knows I'll never come back. Why is reality so painfully fucking dull.
Why? I don't recall growing up in the 80s and 90s and it being this way. What has happened that people have become such horrible sacks of meat?
"I wouldn't say I have an addiction, I can stop when I want, and while I know that all addicts say that it's genuinely true in my case.
Anyway, aside from that
It gets in the way of the things I enjoy, like reading, I adore reading but I don't even do it once a month because I spend my time at night masturbating instead.
I normally masturbate about 1 hour a night, probably more if I'm honest, it feels like since it directly gives me dopamine or whatever it isn't effected by my depression in the same way other things aren't, I don't really know, I just know it isn't good or healthy, I need advice."
"I was walking from the store and someone said to me good morning 3 times, when i didnt answer (i have anxiety and dont want to talk to random men) he called me fat and said i should loose weight. He is right but im still sad that other people think that and say it to my face.."
"From the moment I took my first breathe I was destined to suffer. When I was 6 years old. I used to be happy and didn't see life for what it was. Living with my mom, she did a copious amount of drugs because of her bad life with her father. She constantly called my sister a whore and would demean me because of the methamphetamine that ran through her veins. When I was 7 my sisters ex boyfriend touched me and raped my sister. 

When I was 9 my mom left me with my dad and stepmom. They also did drugs. My dad would constantly beat me and my stepmom would constantly lie to his face to get him to beat me and my sister. When I turned 14 I tried my first drug, kush. It was with my cousins.  I learned nothing struggled in school and still struggle in life. No matter what i do I cant seem to do the right thing or the smart thing and I'm such a waste of space, my life has been so bad that the happiest i will ever be is to take my final breathe and to finally rest. 

At 16 I was kicked out by my parents and went to live with my sister and brother in law. Falling into a deep depression for 6 years I did absolutely nothing with my life. How could I? I know nothing about life. 

Now I sit here at 22, realizing i have nobody and no one but my sister. I can't even share happy moments because I can't remember the last time I was truly happy. I will never be. 




I deserve it."
"Life is so boring it gives me a constant headache. Every day I wake up knowing I'm gonna have to do the same mind-numbingly tedious routine. Get my lazy ass out of bed, brush my teeth, shower, eat, shit, study, etc.

Life is a game where you futilely fulfill need after need until sooner or later you die. What an utter dissapointment. How can anyone cope with this is beyond me.

I know there's moments where this is not the case, but they are fleeting and far between."
"Why do I have to deal with so much bullshit just because somebody wanted a child.


That's about it. It's not something anyone can take back but me."
"I fucking hate being socially anxious

I hate that I was born extremely fucking ugly and nobody wants to be seen with me

I hate being told to ""get over it"" by normal people who don't feel genuinely sick when they have to socialize or give presentations

I hate always being paired up with the special needs kids because the teachers know I'm too shy to argue (no hate to the kids its just fucking humiliating)

I hated being called racial and misogynistic shit by my classmates and not being able to tell them to fuck off or tell a teacher 

I hate having a normal, talented family and being the only fucking retarded piece of shit who can't act normal because I was cursed with social anxiety

I hate knowing I'm a fucking dissapointment to my parents because they've wasted so much time and money on me but all my other siblings are successful and have lots of friends and I just cry and act depressed all the time

I hate knowing that I'll never succeed in this society no matter how kind i am to others or how hard I try because I'm ugly and don't have any fucking confidence

I fucking hate being alive fuck this life I wish I had the courage to just end it all

"I feel like I‚Äôm gonna kill myself soon. 

I don‚Äôt feel good, I cry every night, I‚Äôm afraid that it‚Äôll be one night, just one late night where I‚Äôm struggling to sleep and I‚Äôll just do it. I can feel it."
"I wake up knowing my phone probably won‚Äôt ring, there isn‚Äôt anyone checking in on me except my mother probably. I have a sister she doesn‚Äôt get it, I barely feel connected to her. My family life is messed up, there is barely any. My ex was my best friend and she is gone too. All I do is work and study to try and fill the void. But sometimes it is so depressing and I don‚Äôt know when it will change. I don‚Äôt know how to make friends. I don‚Äôt know what to say when I talk to people sometimes, I‚Äôm still hurt from the way she left me. I pray sometimes, sometimes I just cry, I‚Äôve become really apathetic, my father put me in debt, I‚Äôm disappointed in my family for a lot of things and now I feel I‚Äôm the only way out, I‚Äôve always felt that way. And it‚Äôs hard looking ahead and feeling like everything is all on you. "
"I'm miserable, most people I meet hate me on instinct, I hate my life, have nobody in my life, am extremely lonely, and just want to die constantly. I don't want to kill myself though since it will make my parents sad, but how do I go on feeling this way and how do I accept the fact that my life will never improve and I might have to deal with this pain for many decades until I eventually get to die?"
I just caught myself planning my suicide again. I know I will do it. Not really soon and it probably won't even work. Do I tell someone? What do I do??
"It's never gotten easier to make friends, or get a girlfriend. Four years of therapy can't stop you from being awkward and ugly. When things were looking up and a few years ago I did get a girlfriend and friends, I still felt empty, and that girl would go on to make me feel like I'm worthless.

I'm probably autistic in a world meant for non autistic people. I have thoughts and behaviors behind closed doors that would make me sound like Joe Goldberg and totally identify me as a creep. Why should I gamble with the fact that someday I may do something horrible to someone that they don't deserve?

Why should I live when I am coded to not be happy in this world?

"I am so so broken right now. I feel like I‚Äôve lost my husband forever. 
Today my therapist said she believes that he has clinical depression (through secondary observation from what I tell her I‚Äôve been observing/going through). She had initially made a diagnosis of cyclothymia but from the episode he‚Äôs had since November, she thinks he‚Äôs slipped into depression sadly. Really struggling to think of how I can try to help him. He refused to see a psychiatrist despite agreeing with me that he does feel that he has cyclothymia when I first explained to him what she said. 
I hate how horrible he treats me when he‚Äôs down. I hate how irritable he becomes. We haven‚Äôt had sex in months either! There was a couple of weeks where he didn‚Äôt even want light on in the house (the house that we all live in together‚Ä¶ with a 3 year old). On the night of my birthday we had dinner out with my friends because I begged him since it was my birthday and she pulled me aside a few days later and said ‚Äúdoes your husband hate you? He didn‚Äôt have a single nice thing to say about you and you‚Äôre one of the kindest/nicest people I know! He only went on and on about what you do that annoys him and how badly you‚Äôre raising your child. Plus everything you don‚Äôt do for him. Not a single nice thing. He seems really selfish‚Äù
I so want to be there for him but this shit really weighs me down. He hasn‚Äôt been genuinely happy in months now. Since end of October. I feel really upset but way more than that I feel really sorry for him. And I‚Äôm worried if he‚Äôll even get better. I would love to tell him all the horrible things he‚Äôs done to me and how he‚Äôs made me feel but I don‚Äôt want to make the situation any worse than it already is.
I feel so sorry for my toddler. 

How do I help him get help?
Anyone who‚Äôs gone through this?"
"I think there's a large percentage of the ""normal"" population that never has. I'm internally saying this shit every week, usually multiple times."
"I was told this the other day at a meeting with like a mental health professional person and it really pissed me off!

No it didn‚Äôt make stronger at all. It made me extremely anxious and a person who walks on eggshells all the time. It made me a people pleaser who doesn‚Äôt set boundaries. It made me doubt myself. It killed something inside me.

I didn‚Äôt deserve it. I didn‚Äôt want or ask to be stronger!

So no it did not make me stronger. It made me weak and fragile and afraid!

"It‚Äôs Saturday night. I‚Äôm currently on the floor of my room. Looking back on the day, I can‚Äôt really remember much about it. I spent a good two hours looking for job applications to fill, and I only managed to complete two. I took a bath after sitting on the floor for hours. I don‚Äôt know why‚ÄîI just couldn‚Äôt move. I was stuck, and now the day is over. I can‚Äôt remember if I ate. Knowing me, probably not. The highlight of my night is watching TikToks of Crashout Kirmmy. No smile on my face. It‚Äôs not helping me feel better, but it‚Äôs something.

People scream, ‚ÄúMental health matters!‚Äù and tell you to check on your friends. I feel like that‚Äôs just something people say to avoid feeling guilty later. There‚Äôs no real action or sincerity behind the words. The truth is, no one cares about mental health until it‚Äôs too late to do anything about it.

"24, NB.

Life has been hard and I could sit here and tell you my life story but I won‚Äôt bother you with it. 
But for background I‚Äôve dealt with SA, homophobia, colorism with most coming of this coming from close family and friends. You can check my post history for more details I guess 

I‚Äôve been dealing with mental health issues for a majority of my life and I‚Äôve found that anytime I have a safe space it is taken away from me. 

Anywho, I‚Äôm moving back to my home state next week which means I no longer have my therapist. We wrote each other goodbye letters and it made me realize he was the only real safe space I‚Äôve ever had in my entire life. 

As a result of everything I will be taking my life a day after my birthday in early November. It makes me sad and I‚Äôve been crying so much. I want to live but the amount of pain and trauma I‚Äôve been through has made it difficult to live. I think about these horrible things for about 97% of the time I‚Äôm awake and I only can sleep for about two hours now. 

I don‚Äôt feel safe telling anyone in my real life because at some point or another almost all of them have betrayed the security of our relationship. Whether it be ghosting, laughing at my pain or gossiping about me. 

I was put on this earth to suffer and I no longer will have suffering. After my birthday (which they won‚Äôt remember) I know I‚Äôll have enough courage and pain to take my life. 

I was so excited to end it but now as I sit in my empty apartment I realize that I will never be happy. Dying is the only solution. 

I‚Äôm sad to disappoint my therapist and even typing this I cry at the fact that he may never see me again. But I know he‚Äôll be happy knowing I‚Äôm no longer in pain. 

Thank you and I love you all. "

On Tuesday after I get home from morning tutoring, I am going to take the entire bottle. It‚Äôs 100 200mg pills, so it‚Äôll be 20,000mg of ibuprofen at once. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going to happen, and a large part of me is terrified, but I know that this needs to happen. 

I mainly hate lying to my mom. That entire time we were at Walmart yesterday, I had the bottle hidden in my purse and I just felt awful having to act like nothing was wrong the rest of the day. Then at work last night I had absolutely no motivation, and I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt again tonight. I hate having to act happy today, since it‚Äôs Easter. I wish I could tell my mom she didn‚Äôt have to buy all that candy, because I‚Äôll never get a chance to eat it. 

A lot of you think I should stay for my mom, and well, I understand why, but I‚Äôve been doing that for the past 8 years, and nothing has gotten better for me. I‚Äôm sick and tired of waiting and waiting for things to change, but they never seem to do. The worst part about this is doing this to her, because the last thing I want to do is put my pain on her. But at the same time I feel I‚Äôve run out of options. Maybe it‚Äôs selfish, well, it is selfish. But I‚Äôve always been a selfless person, so why can‚Äôt I be selfish for one time in my life? All I can do is hope she‚Äôll be okay in the long run. She has my brother, her sister, her mom. She has people that I know will support her through this and give her a reason to keep going. Just like she did for me these past 8 years. 

Also, to the people saying it‚Äôs not worth it because of the agony it may put me through, I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm in enough mental agony that physical won‚Äôt even be much harder. And at least for that time I‚Äôll be focused on that instead of my dark thoughts. And if I live, and it messes my body up, I mean, my mind is already messed up, so what‚Äôs so bad about my body getting messed up, too? Not like I have a good life ahead of me, if any.


I need to do this, no matter what. "
"Lying here, hoping maybe I just won't wake up tomorrow. I just wanna die. My heart is broken, my spirit is broken, I'm just done and over it. "
"This isn‚Äôt supposed to be a negative post, it‚Äôs simply something that I observed after getting through a point in my life where I was suicidal, and hell, I might just sound stupid since I‚Äôm only really a 15 yo, not some wise old man on a mountain or anything.

It never really goes away like people always say. It‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing that it doesn‚Äôt go away, it‚Äôs just human emotion. Depression is always sort of there when it comes. It can get worse, or it can get better, but having days where you crash into a state of depression is just human. Emotion in general is human, and who‚Äôs to say a brief version of worse sadness isn‚Äôt normal?

My point is when it comes to suicidal depression, obviously go get help because therapy can genuinely help (most definitely helped for me), but don‚Äôt expect it to immediately poof out of existence. Doing better is always something to be proud of. You got this :)"
"please, i‚Äôm so tired. i‚Äôm so mentally exhausted. everything is so draining. i‚Äôm tired of constantly feeling like i‚Äôm drowning in self hatred towards myself. i‚Äôm tired of struggling with self harm. i‚Äôm tired of struggling with these thoughts. all people tell me is ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù bullshit. it‚Äôs been more than a year, and nothing has changed. i feel so emotionally numb at this point. i‚Äôm tired of feeling like i‚Äôll never be pretty enough for anyone, so why try? i‚Äôm tired of dealing with everything alone. i miss when i was still kind, empathetic, etc. it feels like i‚Äôve died already. i‚Äôve gotten way more cold hearted, less empathetic, i snap at people easily now, etc. why am i still here? why can‚Äôt i leave already? i don‚Äôt want to be here anymore."
"Just waiting for my death to come, thought i‚Äôd say goodbye. I never really participated in this sub but still, couldn‚Äôt hurt."
"Life as a single person is simply not worth living. I have firmly believed this since I was 16, and I still believe it at 32. The holidays are the worst. I‚Äôve decided that these are the last holidays I‚Äôm living through single. Next year, I‚Äôm ending it all in October. I‚Äôm decided on it. Life isn‚Äôt worth living single, so I‚Äôm done."
"I‚Äôve been having a rough couple months &amp; struggling mentally again. I recently picked up a babysitting job for extra money to help pay for school. It‚Äôs not bad of a job either because the kid is really smart &amp; fun to take care of, and it takes my mind off things. 

A couple days ago I came by to watch her &amp; she showed me all the drawings she made in a little bottle. She said, ‚ÄúI made this for you and my mommy so you know that we‚Äôre always here.‚Äù

She said it so casually &amp; she immediately moved onto playing with one of her toys. It meant the world to me and it gave me a reason to keep moving. "
I just want to end my life but my anxiety won‚Äôt let me do it because my mom would be so heartbroken‚Ä¶ I feel like a puppet being pulled in all directions with a bunch of strings.
"Idk man. My mind always just feels so zoned-out and foggy, like I'm living in a constant haze. It's as if I'm just passively going through the motions of life on autopilot, barely aware of what's happening around me.

When I was a young teen, my mind was sharp and memory was so much sharper. My thoughts were actually clear, and I never experienced the head fog I struggle with now. I could easily recall every detail of my week and was deeply engaged with everything I did‚Äîwhether it was reading books, watching shows, or just living life. I was much more aware of the world around me, able to process information effortlessly. But now, my mind just feels miles away from the present moment, and my day-to-day memory has significantly decreased.

Back in the day, I could easily binge-watch an entire season of a TV show in just a day or two. I was genuinely invested, I found immense satisfaction in every episode, and I remembered every detail. I could actually engage in deep, insightful discussions about the show with others at school. Now, it is almost impossible to do that; I've become too zoned-out to hold a complex conversation like I once could‚Äî ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo‚Äù answers is sometimes all that I can cook up before it gets too difficult to think.

These days, I can barely get through 20-30 minutes of a show without needing to pause and come back to it another time. My mind just becomes too zoned-out and disengaged to process what‚Äôs happening.

"here it is: 

i‚Äôm not really sure on how to start this so here. By the time you've read this hopefully I'm dead. I've always had a pessimistic outlook on life and I never wanted to live past thirteen. I knew I've wanted to die since I was born. Nothing ever made me happy, Nothing filled the void in my chest. Nothing made my life worth living. The world would be a better place without me. Every single day of my life I've thought about killing myself and after several failed attempts hopefully this one worked. I wasn't smart, funny, pretty or a good person. I'm a piece of shit that got what she deserved. I've always struggled with depression but no one believed or took me seriously. Depression has always been this thing that followed me around and no one could see that I was struggling or even bothered to help me. Not that I have anyone to blame besides myself. I knew the only thing that would make me happy was dying. I've always seen death as a second option. Something freeing in a way. Even if i did get the help i needed i would‚Äôve ended up with the same resolution. I never saw myself graduating or going to college. I'm not good at anything and have no hobbies, passion, or motivation. Senior year has been the absolute worst year of my life and I've never hated myself more. After losing my best friend I knew nothing in my life would be worth living. I'm sorry to everyone I've disappointed and let down. I take full responsibility for what I've done because this is what I wanted. This wasn‚Äôt an impulsive decision either. I know this is what I want. I felt numb and empty all the time. I knew I wasn't alone but no matter what I felt alone. I felt like there was this huge gap between everyone else and me. I hated everything and didn‚Äôt see the point of functioning in everyday life. I'm tired of never being taken seriously and all of my problems being overlooked. I'm tired of being a people pleaser and being a doormat. Maybe now people will actually listen. i‚Äôve always felt replaceable and like a burden. 

to my family, don‚Äôt blame yourself. This was a well thought out decision and something that I've been wanting to do. I'm sorry for being a troubled kid and putting you through the worst. 

Mom: I love you so much. You were my everything and an amazing mother. I know we had our differences but I couldn't have asked for a better mother. Thank you for always being there for me and helping me save up for the car. all of the money can go to you, shanelle &amp; dad. I appreciate you, you have no idea. I'm sorry I never told you how pretty I really thought you were. you‚Äôre so beautiful. don‚Äôt blame yourself, you did nothing wrong. My favorite memory was our shopping sprees that we‚Äôd go to when I was younger and we‚Äôd go to macys. 

shanelle (sister): i love you shanelle. you were a second mother. I hate having to leave you but I will still always be there. continue to be the amazing, hardcore marvel fan that you are. I love you so much. you were the best older sister anyone could ask for. I'll miss all the times we laughed. I hope you continue your nursing career. you made me so happy or at least what i considered happy. My favorite memory was all the times we‚Äôd eat food and watch our shows together. i always looked forward to that. 

dad: Thank you for everything. You were an amazing father and I will always love you. I'm sorry we never spent much time together but the times we went to dinner were my favorite memories. you‚Äôre the best and you tried your best and that‚Äôs all i could ever ask for. I know you wanted the best for me and I'm sorry I could not give that to you. My favorite memory was us jumping on the bed together when I was younger. I've always kept that memory. 

maggie: Maggie I love you so much &amp; still do. Even after our fallout I never had an ounce of hate for you in my heart. you were one of the only people who i felt truly got me in my entire life. i‚Äôm sorry that i wasn‚Äôt a good friend to you and truly wish things between us would‚Äôve ended differently/didn‚Äôt end at all. After our friendship ended everything in my life changed and in no way shape or form am I blaming you because once again this is something I wanted. you‚Äôre going to be an amazing orthodontist and I can't wait to see you succeed in the world. Thank you for helping me find out who I really am. My favorite memory was when you and I would sing to the customers at cinnaholic and they‚Äôd all stare at us. 

casandra: casandra you were an amazing friend to me as well. We talked about so many things and you were there for me and we talked about things I've never told anyone. You are so smart and always knew exactly what to say. You are everything I want to be as a person. My favorite memory was our late night facetimes. 

taylor: you‚Äôre so sweet, kind and sensitive. never change. I love you too Taylor, I'm sorry for always messing up and ruining everything. never change. My favorite memory was our bottoms movie day. 

shaleya: i love you so much and appreciate everything you‚Äôve ever done for me. You were the only consistent friend I had and you were there for me all year. I'm sorry I didn't say how much you meant to me more often. My favorite memory was our October spirit Halloween era. 

l christle: i love you so much. you always put a smile on my face no matter what. you were one the funniest people i‚Äôve ever met. you‚Äôre going to do great things in this world. i know it. never change either. My favorite memory was that one time I came over to your house and we stayed out really late. 

to all my friends I could‚Äôve said more but i don‚Äôt have the energy to type that much so sorry for this shitty letter. 

ps: I don't want a funeral. I seriously don‚Äôt want this to become a whole thing and an investigation to happen, just let me die and move on. my only wish is for everyone to forget about me and move on. 



3/28/24: i‚Äôm still alive!! thank you all for the sweet comments, i didn‚Äôt expect people to see this. i‚Äôm sorry for worrying everyone. i am okay! btw im 17"
"idek what they can even do for me but I know I‚Äôm def not in the mood for a 5150 üôÉüôÉ

edit: I mentioned feeling anxious and sad but froze up and immediately said ‚Äúno‚Äù without even thinking when she asked if I wanted to hurt myself. she suggested counseling and I‚Äôm looking into it but I‚Äôm very limited financially."
"Its decided. I feel bad for my friends and loved ones, but I'm not built for this. I don't want to experience finding out what friend of mine dies of a hate crime, which family member I lose to climate disasters, who do I know is going to experience a shooting, how fucked am I going to become financially while enjoying nothing.

I'm fucking done. I have the date picked out which is far af from now, I have loved ones birthdays on every month sadly but I think I found one date that atleast a few weeks away from everyone's day and major holidays. I can prepare with this time. I always forget things at people's homes, they won't realize why I'm leaving them this time and hopefully never will.

I can slowly stop taking my meds, start drinking, refuse to sign up for medical insurance. Anything that will give me incentive when I start feeling like turning around. Because fuck that. Fuckk all of this. I called the EMTs on myself in 2015 and I regret it. I'm manifesting and taking actions to selfishly just give myself some fucking peace. "
"I made a post a few days ago about killing myself on Halloween night. In that post I got more help, kindness, and concern for what I have been going through than anyone has shown me in 9 years since my serious symptoms began. I had a breakdown and cried for hours tonight cause I wasn't dead yet but my problems were still there. I don't know if I should thank you for saving my life or hate you for making me suffer longer but I wanted to let you guys know I'm alive because of you. Happy November I guess. "
" People are telling me that I'm just overreacting and that it happens to everyone, and that it's okay, but i feel like i'm just dumb. I always mess things up. I broke the storage space under the bed because i stood on it. I broke my headphones by stepping on them, i broke a plate because i put on the edge of the table. All those things could have been easily prevented if i would just think a little bit more. People are saying that it happens to everyone but somehow it seems like i'm the only one that dumb. "
"After years of rotting away at home I finally decided to seek out therapy. It's everyone's go to suggestion so I convinced myself to try it... And a few appointments in, after I explained my life story and the health issues I face - IBD, super fucking loud Tinnitus and VSS - she said that I need a mindset change and that I am choosing to be depressed? I nearly fell off my chair when she said that. Her reasoning was that there are people without limbs or more severe health conditions living 'full' lives therefore I have the choice to do that too and 'inspire' others? 

I was walking through a quiet forest last week, and I could barely hear the birds sing.. but because I 'look' healthy, people assume that I'm fine. 

When I showed her how loud my tinnitus is she said to turn it off immediately.. and I hear that every second of every day forever.. and a couple of minutes later, she says that my suffering is a choice. I don't understand. 

I've literally exhaused all my options and there is absolutely no support, even though people always say that support is always there if you seek it out.. How badly I wish that assisted suicide was legal.. "
"I see advice saying to reach out to loved ones when you're struggling and while the sentiment is nice, reaching out tends to have more negatives than postives. 

Most people don't know how to help, don't want to help, or tries to help but then gets sick of you eventually. And I don't blame them, I get sick of myself sometimes. 

It just seems like keeping my bullshit to myself is the healthiest for all involved yet that's an issue too. People will either take it personally and get upset with you or just leave you in the dust entirely because they don't want to deal with someone who feels like shit all the time and has to isolate themselves as a way of coping

I am torn."
"So, after ~3 years I think I‚Äôve found that my depression that runs like this:

-General decline (everything seems to be getting harder, becoming increasingly sensitive)

-‚ÄúThe Pit‚Äù (suicidal feelings become sharp, I feel like I‚Äôm living in hell)

-Stasis (feeling mostly numb, at the best I feel somewhat peaceful, but mostly empty)

Does anyone else experience anything like this?

(And how do you get out of this cycle‚Ä¶)"

"I will never try to kill myself. I don't have the balls  to try and inflict pain on my body or do something that might kill me. But if someone or something else were to do it that would be great. Sleeping and never waking up, getting in a car crash, getting shot by someone. I just want to disappear."
Can‚Äôt get a job. Even if I got a job I would not be able to afford rent. Can‚Äôt afford a car. Can‚Äôt afford insurance this is fucking bullshit. Live at home and play fucking video games all day because I get no call backs from jobs.
"I'm 37. I still rent. I don't have a hole lot in my savings. My 401k is about 1/4 what it should be. My teeth are shot from drinking and soda. I've never had a relationship longer than 3 months since high school. I've wasted money on stupid things that I ended up selling for way less. Speeding tickets. I just got a wreckless driving the other day. My insurance is already doubled. I can't lose my license. I can afford a lawyer or heavy fine but that money is saved for other things. I'm sick of my bad decisions. The speeding happened after I was laying in bed thinking of suicide and decided to get out of the house but people drove me nuts and I sped home to get away from everyone. Each fuck up makes my life that much harder to come back from. I never thought about the future because I never planned on living this long. I just got a puppy so I'm stuck here another 12-15 years. That's what I said about my last dog but she went earlier than expected so I got another. And I'm regretting that decision. Not because I don't love her, but because I don't want to be here. 

Edit: for clarification I've been on medication and in therapy for years. Currently been sober for 5. But thank you all for supportive words. I told my father and he said it's because I ""don't think about anyone other than myself. If only he knew the only reason I never killed myself was so he wouldn't have to go through that lol. "

I‚Äôve experienced so much trauma in my life, from finding my father‚Äôs lifeless body on the floor when I was 11 years old, being sexually assaulted multiple times in college. Almost being killed in an abusive relationship with someone who I thought I was truly in love with. I‚Äôm only 24 years old and I‚Äôm fucking over it. I can‚Äôt do this anymore. "
"I hate it so much. I hate wanting it. I hate not having it. I don‚Äôt want to think about it at all. Do I understand myself or do I not? 

I have trauma related to it. Most of being unprocessed, leading me to believe all of those situations were my fault. So, when I crave it. It feels like a horrible choice. Like I‚Äôm ruining my soul. I miss my ex. I miss how it felt with him. It felt like when I needed it, it wasn‚Äôt shameful. It was beautiful. It was trusting. It was how it was always meant to be. Now, I can‚Äôt even enjoy myself because I end up crying from the memories of something I can‚Äôt have anymore. Memories that sink my heart.

"You ever get in those deep pits of hating yourself. Thinking you‚Äôre a waste, that life isn‚Äôt worth it and considering.

Well tonight me and my friend got split up from our group and missed the train and we were alone. We end up getting an Uber together, and get into a conversation about the things we love about a certain friend of ours, and some of the things we were both down about (family problems for him, me feeling out of place in our group). He said something to me which I really didn‚Äôt expect: 

‚ÄúYou have no idea how high regarded you are. You are one of the kindest people I have ever met. You are a really good person, you‚Äôre genuinely one of my favourite people in this group.‚Äù

Maybe it really was a sign. And maybe sharing this is your sign. 

After a horrible depressive episode last night, I was feeling like life was not worth it. Loathed myself to bits. But hearing those words‚Ä¶to whoever is reading this, you have no idea how people see you. Don‚Äôt listen to that awful voice in your head. That‚Äôs your depression talking (and it IS), and not always a reflection of reality."
"As the title says. I‚Äôve considered it heavily. Every possible outcome, every method, every option. I cant leave the people i love in pain, and selfishly, i dont want to die in pain either. So why is it that every time i think of my future i see nothing. Why when i think about improving my life it feels pointless. I feel like im just waiting for an accident. Im waiting for something out of my control to make my life just stop being awful. Make my life just stop. 

Its bullshit. I want to live with joy in my heart or a true smile on my face or for anything, for any reason at all i just cant find one. I cant find the motivation to keep going but i cant let it end either. Depression is a cruel purgatory and i just want off this fucking ride "
"As someone who‚Äôs had depression and issues on and off since age 17 I can tell you it feels much worse now then it did then although at the time when I was lying on my mums couch at age 18 it seemed bad, but depression can change/morph in how it affects us

We are only alive in this moment and they say the past has gone, but it‚Äôs so hard to forget things that bother me, and to forget things such as huge periods of unemployment, not many relationships or holidays and just how it‚Äôs been a struggle. The idea of getting older terrifies me at times too because unless I sort my life out and find some peace old age will haunt me because of the regrets. I know I need to keep the faith that I can turn it around, I have a son who‚Äôs nearly 18 and I‚Äôd like him to be proud of me one day

"My online friends hate me, laugh at my suicide attempts and my misery, they obviously want me dead, one of them told me to kms when i said i was suicidal.

"Basically the title.

I was very much full of life, optimistic and overjoyed teenager who was looking for a promising life. But I kept losing at life over and over since 2016. By 2018, I was half dead. By 2020, I barely felt any joy. Fast forward to present, I barely have any energy left.

I don't have much friends. No hobbies. No Girlfriend. I don't interact with most of my family. I am pretty much a loner. I used to enjoy video games or tv series. Now, I can't even seem to enjoy those. I can't motivate myself to workout. I eat just enough for me to survive. I don't even like eating anymore. I am so weak that I get minor tremors sometimes due to deficiency.

All I have left is my job and the money I have saved. I have saved so much money in a short time , I don't even know what to do with it. I don't feel any happiness when I get a hike or promotion or a bonus. I don't feel any joy when I buy things even for myself. I feel nothing. Just empty. 

Most people in my life have observed and have commented that "" I have become very silent"". Well, what do I do? I don't have anything to look forward to. I am just a dead man counting his days."
"I personally feel like my depression is making me more dumb as time goes on. I saw that someone else made a thread here titled the same, so I don't think I'm the only one that's come to this conclusion, but maybe they and I are the only ones to have noticed it and have taken an issue with it, but it's fucking terrible. 

My brain literally will have chunks of time where it's doing nothing and I can't bring myself to do much more than doomscroll when that happens. Conversations are nearly impossible because I don't have the mental capacity to cook up responses that aren't just dumb word play jokes. 

I don't know, maybe I'm taking my own illness harder than I should, but it honestly kills me that my brain is regressing as it is. I use to write novels on a site called ""MobaMingle"", but I can't even work my brain hard enough to do that."

"That‚Äôs how I feel I‚Äôll meet my end.

I‚Äôm not currently in any danger. In fact, I‚Äôm maybe in the best place I‚Äôve ever been in life. I finally found a med regimen that works after a decade of trying, I‚Äôm working on finding my ‚Äúlife worth living‚Äù (as my therapist puts it), and I have a support system.

Nonetheless, the thoughts of suicide are daily. I really do believe I‚Äôm one major setback away from ending it all. Of course I‚Äôve struggled with SI before but I‚Äôve always managed to come through it.

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a comforting thought that gives me solace in the face of adversity or what. I‚Äôm not sure what to think of it. I guess I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has any similar beliefs or thoughts about this.

"I hate this world, I hate how cruel everyone is to each other, the pain and suffering‚Ä¶ why should I be allowed to be alive and comfortable when so many are dying and suffering, this world is so fucking cruel and I wish it was better so I‚Äôd want to be a part of it‚Ä¶I just hope everything gets better because I can‚Äôt take it anymore:( "
"32f

It took years to come to the point where I am comfortable with the idea. I know exactly how and where I‚Äôll do it. I just have nothing left. My family never loved me, which caused me develop into an awkward and weird person. I used to love my daddy, remember him coming home every night and getting so excited I‚Äôd fling myself out of bed every night to hug him. 

My mom and dad divorced when I was around 4, I was heartbroken and thought my mom was so mean for getting rid of him. I didn‚Äôt cope well. Anyway, he ended up being a deadbeat who didn‚Äôt give a shit about his daughters. One time, he even compared us, and said my sister was better looking. I was fat then lol, lucky me I was the less attractive daughter I guess! :) 

My mom stopped hugging me when I was 5-6, and I didn‚Äôt understand why. She blamed me constantly for things, and tore me down when I was already low. My passions and interests were annoying to her.

I have developmental issues (ADHD) that went untreated and no one tried to help, so I dropped out of high school. By the time I was a teenager, I was so extremely antisocial that I lost connection with everyone. I only learned how to read and fear people, how to stay off their radars to protect myself. I erected walls around my heart and mind.

 At this point, I self-sabotage any relationship that could possibly be good out of fear I‚Äôm going to be rejected, my standards for friendship and love are so high they belong in a novel, because no one will ever be enough for me. And I know I‚Äôm not enough for anyone either.

The last crutch I had just crumbled underneath me. I have literally nothing to live for anymore, other than my animals and one other person.  

I‚Äôm probably going to do it soon if I can‚Äôt find another crutch. I‚Äôm barely coping with this life. 

All I wanted to was to know the unconditional love of one human who could see the good in me despite my problems. But the world is no one‚Äôs paradise, and I‚Äôm too weak to make my own. This place is tough."
Am I just really introverted? I try to be sociable whenever I can but feel no joy in it. I like being alone but I don't like feeling alone either. Why am I like this
"My parents are traveling this week, a great opportunity to try something... I'm just finalizing my music album.

In any case, I'm not sure that I'll be able to kill myself, maybe I can... I want to leave some things to my family as a keepsake. I'm exhausted from everything around me, weakly I don't see a future in my life, so... Ending everything is better.

The fact that I have great support from everyone who loves me irritates me, because I feel that I don't deserve their help, there are so many people with problems that are much worse than mine. The truth is that my depression doesn't only affect me, but everyone who wants to help me."
Lifelong atheist here but just hoping for some hope? I wasted my life in a strange way.

"I am 29 F and I have always been a loner . I was bullied a lot in my school due to my ethnicity and was often beaten up. Never had any friends , was always the person who ended up not being chosen in any team, never had anyone wish me on my birthday , always ate alone .

I always yearned for meaningful friendships but never had any. Started to hate myself believing something was wrong with me . I also have social anxiety and I am scared of people. I think I will be lonely for my entire existence, but I want to be happy. Any suggestions for ways to become happy while being lonely ?"
"My boyfriend just told me that he doesn't care if I kill myself. I've been told to kill myself every single day. I'm done. I'm fucking done.

"People always say that you should ‚Äòask for help‚Äô - what good has that ever done? Half the time you ask people for help they start going on about insincere bullshit that they‚Äôre just saying as if they‚Äôre on auto pilot - shit like ‚Äòyeah we all get like that sometimes‚Äô, ‚Äòhave you thought about therapy‚Äô, and my personal favourite ‚Äòwhy?‚Äô. And I don‚Äôt necessarily blame them, wtf can they do? The other half accept that they don‚Äôt know what to do and just sort of beat around the bush.

This probably just sounds like nonsensical rambling, I‚Äôm pretty fucked up right now, lonely and angry and just looking for at least one poor sod to listen - pretty ironic to be on reddit for that (I know).

Overall, sick of the bullshit and peoples insincerity, and when you come across as bitter people label you as cynical and negative and don‚Äôt want nothing to do with you - god I love people ;)."
"idk it was pretty funny but also made me feel kinda weird. we were talking about my life in college and specifically how i dry my clothes. i said i just toss them over the open doors of my clothing drawer. then she said, ""why dont you stretch a rope across your room? oh wait you cant be trusted with those, haha!"" it wasnt malicious, i could hear it in her tone but it made me feel strange. she dismisses my mental health stuff usually. now im thinking, what if she is depressed too and i need to help her? does she know more than i think she does? i love all the dark humour shit but when it comes from a parent it feels kinda off? or maybe its just me."
"She‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to live for as long as possible. I wanna become as old as I can get‚Äù

My answer: somewhere in my 70s. Actually 50s if I don‚Äôt have kids.


Her answer reminded me WANTING to live is normal. A lot of people, even though their life isn‚Äôt perfect, have an innate desire to be alive and remain so


Me however, I never connected with life and I don‚Äôt think I ever have. I‚Äôm 28. I‚Äôm doing okay for the most part but I never felt like I have this attachment to life which is why I can say I wouldn‚Äôt mind dying relatively young. Although I have had some suicidal thoughts before I could never do it and it‚Äôs against my religion

She also told me about some scary dreams she has where she is attacked or there is a shooter somewhere and she dies. I rarely have those dreams. I genuinely don‚Äôt feel like I care if that happens to me? Isn‚Äôt that horrible. If it‚Äôs my time to it‚Äôs my time to go I guess

I never liked this thing called life. Is it even depression  when you have always felt like this? Pretty much born this way. "
"I've been stuck with chronic fatigue for almost three months and can barely get out of bed. I still get things done and handle my responsibilities, but it's hard to keep up with social plans. I often end up canceling because I just want to stay home, and it's tough to explain this to friends who don't really know me."
"I've been through a lot emotionally, and traditional therapy didn't quite click for me. I wasn't ready to openly express my emotions to a real person who could judge me. But then, a friend mentioned Flint.  


I have to admit, it's made a huge difference. There are moments when I feel overwhelmed, and using Flint to express myself usually makes me feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I feel like I can tell it anything, and it will just help me straight away.

  
Honestly, if therapy is too expensive or invasive for you, like it was for me, maybe give Flint a try. It's a genuine tool that's helped me find some peace."
"I have been diagnosed with MDD for about 4 years now, and am on medication. But I was just having one of those days where I was just feeling extra down yaknow?

The only responses I got back were ‚Äúhaha same‚Äù, ‚Äúme fr‚Äù and ‚Äúwe all want to die‚Äù. To be honest it was kind of disappointing. These are people I‚Äôve spent 6+ years of my life with, I share everything with them. But then just brushing aside something like this? I don‚Äôt know what to feel. I don‚Äôt know if they thought it was a joke, even tho I usually don‚Äôt joke about these things. Or maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking it all.

I was and still am heartbroken over it but in some way I recently discovered that death isn‚Äôt as bad as we think and how she‚Äôs away from this cruel world. A memory I remember is how we were at my apartment last year around March with 2 other friends at 1am discussing the trials and tribulations of life and what we were all dealing with in adulthood. I used to think ‚ÄúMan they‚Äôre gone they didn‚Äôt get to experience this‚Äù but what are they really missing?

Then I'd live under an assumed name off grid where, nobody could ever find me. Nobody would ever even know who I was. I just stay to myself in peace and quiet. No more bad memories, no more broken family, nothing but me finally being free. All I've ever wanted was to be happy and loved and at peace. But I've been hurt so many times I'd rather not be surrounded by people at all. Not even stranger's. I think the only way I will be truly free and at peace will be if I am completely by myself alone but at nobody's whim's but my own.

I went to a religious school and was basically the ugly outcast and I've been sexually abused for years as a child and this whole sexual abuse thing really messed me up . now one of my  who friend  had blocked me  is back and shes playing the victim that I was the one who left her blah blah blah , fucking sucks . I used to have a cat But then it was forcefully abandoned . Coming to the present situation I had another friend who was with me for like 2 years and we had planned to move out next year ( when we turn 18 ) now she is in better terms with her dad and she doesn't wants to move out all good and fine but then I feel like even she doesn't wants me anymore cuz anyway she ain't moving out . Today she told me I'm too boring and I feel like she's tired of me atm while I really want her to be in my life I see no hopes so the only friend I had left is also gone ): Fuck it I'm all alone I'm so fucking pathetic my own father doesn't loves me .

edit :- My mom interrupted and they took  me to the hospital which saved my life at the last moment . I need some time to figure out things even though I'm disappointed I dint die despite trying my best too . Right now my head is so empty and my mom is acting more abusive idk what I'll do . "

I really need advice because I am at a loss with how to compromise this situation.

"To quote a line from ""A Clockwork Orange"" that stuck to me for over 10 years now:
""Well, put it this way, I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me.""

This is exactly how I've been feeling for years, this feeling of dread that suffocates me. My body is always tensed, waiting for something terrible to happen, so terrible my mind won't be able to take it and I'll kill myself. 
It almost happened a few times before and it was terrible and now I just feel miserable, waiting for the next tragedy to hit me.

Every year this feeling of dread becomes stronger and heavier, affecting my life. I don't know if my body and mind can take it, it's hard enough now when I'm 28, I can't imagine dragging myself till I'm 30. 

It's strange how comforting it is to be alone but at the same time it's terrifying. "
"Pretty embarrassing as a man to admit but I cried in the shower after coming home from work, idk why I did I just started to break down and fall to my knees weeping "
Just wanting someone to acknowledge I exist 
who decide why come people will get decent lifes while others have to live terrible lifes and why? Will we ever know the answer?
"I am 26 years old and I consider myself as a failure of the highest degree

I am sad, depressed &amp; lonely, I failed in my college and then I had to drop out &amp; I haven't done anything ever since then

I wasn't interested in anything in my life except for playing video games, I could barely pass my school &amp; then I flunked miserably in my college

I wish I shouldn't have been born, I am just a burden on my parents and on this society 

If I could unalive myself and add the remaining years of my life into someone else then I would gladly do so because my life is worthless anyway"
"I used to love watching movies. I grew up watching Turner Classic, and it instilled a love of film in me. I used to get super hooked on shows like Twin Peaks or Game of Thrones. I used to love playing video games, I‚Äôd spend hours and hours playing Skyrim or Zelda. I even used to really enjoy YouTube videos from my favorite channels, video essays or lets plays or whatever.

Now, nothing holds my attention. It‚Äôs like my brain refuses to produce endorphins because f*ck me I guess. I don‚Äôt want to watch anything, and everything I try to watch, I get bored within ten minutes, no matter what. And it‚Äôs been like this all year. I just don‚Äôt care about any of it. Even video games I get bored and lose interest, even if it‚Äôs a favorite of mine.

Now, I wouldn‚Äôt mind it so much, if something else grabbed my interest to take its place. But it hasn‚Äôt. Now, *nothing* interests me. My favorite comic series finally came out with a new issue a while back, and it‚Äôs at a pivotal point in the story, but I just don‚Äôt have any desire to go read it. Even my favorite comfort show stopped making me laugh.

I‚Äôm just doom scrolling Reddit until I have to do some life stuff like cooking or going to the store. Everything feels like a flat plateau of nothingness."
"As I get older, I‚Äôm starting to become more aware of the telltale signs that my depression symptoms are getting worse. I‚Äôve noticed that one very specific symptom is that I feel nostalgic about so many things. In a melancholy way, not a fun way. I think it‚Äôs my brain‚Äôs way of trying to comfort me by flooding me with memories of pleasant times. However, the memories often make me feel sad and empty when I contrast them with how my life is now. I even sometimes feel sad when I‚Äôm doing something pleasant because I worry that it will be a long time before I get to do something pleasant again. This obviously makes it really hard for me to enjoy the moment. I‚Äôve been practicing mindfulness, I‚Äôve been to therapy, and I tried bupropion, but I had problems with the side effects, so I‚Äôm not currently medicated. 

I guess I just wondered if anyone else has noticed excessive sentimentality or nostalgia as a precursor to a depressive episode. "
"Everybody experiences and copes with depression differently. Personally I can't cry. I get teary eyed and lose a tear here and there (mostly because of sad things I see/hear and not really my own pain tho). I feel the gut wrenching pain of depression. The despair, the heaviness, the tight chest. I just can't cry and that's okay. Not crying doesn't mean we're not experiencing depression. 
To anyone out there who is experiencing the same thing: I see you and you are just as valid as anyone else. Be kind to yourself &lt;3"
"My(18m) mom was diagnosed with stage 4 skin cancer 4 months ago and has been declining ever since with only weeks left if that. Taking care of her and just seeing a walking carcass that used to be my lively mom is killing me inside. So young yet no motivation or drive anymore and barely any family/friends reaching out to see how I‚Äôm doing so I feel in this alone with only my dad and her sister. Going off to community college soon, but couldn‚Äôt give less of a fuck. Been depressed for years, but at my absolute lowest. Don‚Äôt even have the energy to cry anymore just suffer in silent sadness. Stuff I loved to do I don‚Äôt care for anymore. Will my life get any better? 

Edit:Thank you guys for all your advice and motivation it has really helped me more than you even know "
"I just got back from my dentist and am now crying in my bed. I looked it up, they won't judge you, they should be glad you even care to come get help. I went against all of my anxiety and he criticized me and they laughed at me.  
""She obviously doesn't use a toothbrush"" (I do)  
""She needs a lot of work done.""  
So much sighing and glaring. My poor dental conditions are the reason I stopped smiling in pictures, the reason I have body dysmorphia, the reason I just want to end it all. I keep telling myself, ""Suicide won't fix your teeth,"" but my brain keeps pushing methods into my head. Every time I smile at myself in the mirror I start crying because I'm afraid that it will never get better and that its all my fault that I can do a simple thing such as taking care of my teeth. I constantly think about how bad my breath must smell and how disgusting I must look, I told my best friend and they told me that every time I smile, it makes them happy. They said that they try their best to make me laugh just so they can see me smile, it made me so happy and hopeful, but now I am still scared. Could ending life end my dental problems? My depression always makes me think bad about myself, but my teeth in particular make me so self conscious that I feel like I only have one last resort."
"I don't know if I'm the one that's not human or if I'm the only real human, but that's how I think now, and I can't go a single day without a mental breakdown and wishing death on myself and/or others. My empathy has died because I realized nobody else truly has empathy either, unless they have something to get out of you. I just don't by into or believe at all anymore in good or decency, literally everything is just garbage to me. I tried therapy for years and several different medications, none of it helped, and I at a completely lost of what to do at this point. I've wasted my entire life. I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to take it. "
f22- my time is coming. i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm afraid to die anymore. i have dreams that im about to die and i don‚Äôt get scared anymore. it‚Äôs almost bliss. calming.  I‚Äôve been suicidal since i was 6. i‚Äôm coming up on 23. every day feels like im ripping my teeth out and im dragging myself along. but i don‚Äôt think i care anymore. i don‚Äôt think i care that people will grieve. this lifetime has been so full of pain and terror inflicted on me. i don‚Äôt want to make myself a victim. but i can‚Äôt take anymore trauma. i can‚Äôt take anymore hurt. and i think i am ready. maybe if i was actually ready i wouldn‚Äôt be here on a random reddit post. but i dont have anything else. my friends don‚Äôt get it. my family doesn‚Äôt care. i just need someone to hear how i feel before i just disappear.  i don‚Äôt want to cope for the rest of my life. some people aren‚Äôt meant to bring something to the world. some people are meant to just be a statistic. some people just aren‚Äôt meant to be. who knows. whatever.
"it‚Äôs making me go insane holy shit, no joke i start talking to my wall"
"God, I was happy
Easter egg hunting with friends, playing in my friends back yards, holidays feeling magical, being HAPPY to wake up, being sad to go to sleep, pancakes and Minecraft, field day at school. 
After I turned 12 something just stopped working inside of me and I lost everything good. I have never recovered, I have never gotten back to a place of happiness. 
My life is dry, I miss how colorful it all was. I know it will never happen but I‚Äôd rather be a kid again for a few years and just die then keep doing this shit."
"I'm not worthy of it. I'm a fucking idiot and unworthy of love or respect. And no, not everyone is deserving. I deserve to be ignored, to be hated, to be thrown out on the street. I'm such a fucking asshole to everybody. I won't kill myself but I hope I die by the time I'm 40. "
"For privacy reasons I'll just state that I'm a girl in my early 20s. I've been clinically depressed and a smoker for around 3 years now, during which I've pretty much spent my days bedrotting after I've finished any errands, and my physical health and fitness have suffered a lot; I get tired after two flights of stairs, walking uphill, etc. I'm aware that this is also very much due to smoking, which I have managed to quit one time for 2-3 months, but I currently don't have anything else to help me through the stress of university, family issues, etc. I also don't have the facilities to exercise at home and I'm absolutely terrified of going to the gym or any kind of public exercise, but I feel like working out is one of the few options I have left that could possibly improve my life. My depression is also worsened by my physical appearance as well, and while my BMI is ""normal"", I still hate the way I look, which is why I feel that exercising might help me in this respect as well. Any tips on how to start or experiences with similar things are much appreciated."
"Just those three things, am I asking for too much?"
"I‚Äôm on all kinds of meds, I‚Äôve seen a therapist, I have a great support network of friends and family, and I still just want to die. Every single day I think about it. I wish I knew how to stop. "
"I'm 35, I live a beautiful country with plenty of sun and security. Portugal has been my home for 5 years. I have a great job, that pays well (which I don't like at all). I never speak to my mom, she is a weird person, I've tried so many times but nothing's is working. 
Travelled the world, have seen everything. Lived in four different countries. I have no idea what to do next.. I feel so lost, so desperate. There nothing that makes me happy anymore. I wake up feeling anxious every day. This life is killing me.. I am so tired "
Why are people very mean?
"I'm 43 - a woman.  My husband had a major stroke 19 months ago.  He was so badly affected he is now pretty much my 6 foot 2 son.  I have tried EVERYTHING to help him.  He is mobile, but his brain injury is so bad that he is often like a 5 year old child.  I grieve desperately for our old life.  It feels like it has only hit me in the last couple of weeks that it is NOT going to get better.  It has been so long now, and we have tried all the jigsaws, and wordsearch puzzles, that he isn't able to do because he can't understand them, that I am just done.  I am so sad and low and depressed all the time.  I have gotten pissed (drunk) tonight because I feel so shit."
"At 28 I've officially missed every meaningful event a young person could experience. First love, parties, close friends, camps, hobbies, art, building skills, etc. Everything is gone and I'm never getting it back. And 28 isn't young ita old enough to never have anything again. The rest of my life is gonna be spent worrying and struggling, meeting people is impossible, everything is a bust. My whole life is ruined because I had a shitty 5-21 and if I could kill myself I would."
"title. I have the worst parents in the fucking world, she also told me I was a mistake. I really wish she just got an abortion."
"I'm a 34F that has been stuck at the same minimum wage job for her entire life. I went to college for something useless and finished going to community college last year for something that's now considered oversaturated and I can't afford anymore school. Finding a full time job feels impossible.

And now I'm finding that having the same job for your whole life is screwing me over and no one else ever wants to hire me and severe social anxiety makes it harder. My only option left is to just die if I can't make enough money to support myself once my family ends up passing. It‚Äôs too late for me. If anyone has any painless suggestions let me know."
" Sadly he was successful in his 3rd try. I have lived with him for a year in a shared house. One night we sat and drank like crazy, around 4-5 am he told me about his issues and one of his attempts. He made me promise to never tell anyone about his issues. It's been really hard for me becuase everyone is asking about what issues he had but in my belief if i tell someone it's a big betrayal. He was 10 years older than me and he was like a brother to me. He planned all of it and sent a letter to the police. But i feel like i could have done something to prevent the event, because he apperently had the same talk he did with me with a friend and then attempted suicide with drugs as far as we know. I think he was also planning to do that when he talked with me. I feel guilty and it feels unreal. I have exams coming and i can't do shit. I don't know how to deal with it. I recently found about my fathers lies and health issues, why my family is broken and the events that caused it. All this is way too much for me. I don't know how to deal with it. I feel weird inside but I have difficulty showing emotions due to past traumas but I am trying my best to show. In the inside i feel like something is broken in me. It feels like i am burning inside but I am unable to show it. Its really hard to process everything, it's really hard to explain even to myself why everything happened, it's even harder to explain my emotions to my friends. Life is too much rn."
"Hi everyone, I am 23, and for the last few months, I was super depressed and stopped going to work for few weeks. And because of that I owe rent for 2 months(September and October). Plus I don't have friends, girlfriend, and money. So last week I was planning to go somewhere in the woods and hang myself, but I don't really want to die. I want to do so many things in my life that I haven't done yet. So yesterday I decided to not kill myself yet and live and see what happens. So yeah, just wanted to share this with someone

Edit: thanks for the kind comments "
"The irony of deleting this post in 5 minutes time. Can‚Äôt reach out to friends or family, can‚Äôt pay a stranger (therapist) to listen, and now I can‚Äôt even vent to strangers anonymously. Wish this brain of mine would understand first world problems and get over itself. "
"Im really tired in life. Like I pray not to wake up anymore. and also embracing death as my savior. Day by day feels like torture to me. but I really love my family that I can't hurt them doing suicide.
I really don't know where it hurts. my body my  head or my brain. How you guys cope w/ this kind of torture? pls English is not my mother tongue. I jist want to vent all those pent up emotion that slowly killing me."
"So, I (33m) am married with two daughters. I love my family to death and would do anything for them. When they are home life is decent. I love coming home from work and having my little girls run at me for a big ol hug or my wife waiting to give me a kiss. It's the highlight of the day. 

My wife and daughters recently went out of town to visit family and I was unable to go due to work. After just a couple days I came to a really grim realization. I have no friends. None, zero, nada. I went through my last three months of calls and it goes like this... Wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, grandma, wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, work, wife, wife, wife, wife. 
Without my family, I have nobody. Everything I do I do completely alone or with my family. This never really bothered me before but I find myself envying people around me who are making plans, going to fun events and overall just loving life. My wife has friends. A whole community of other moms that she goes out with multiple times a week while I... Sit at home. I don't even know how to make friends! 
I'm in a pretty dark place right now. My very existence hinges on my marriage and that terrifies me. Does anyone else here have literally zero friends? How do you manage? "
"I'm not sure what's the point of me posting it but I have a new psychiatrist, and when we talked, I told her that I don't shower or brush my teeth very often (sometimes I don't for several weeks).
I won't go into details because I don't have the energy but she basically shamed me. made me feel disgusting and told me this isn't normal and said that usually teenage girls with depression actually DO want to shower etc.
I feel like sh!t. I feel gross. I'M TRYING.
Is she right? Please."
"I need someone to give me a reason to stay.
I just need someone to tell me everything will get better and I'm not gonna feel like this forever 
I just want someone to notice I'm not doing okay.
how many signs do I have to show before someone notices.
I need someone to tell me they're here for me and I'm not alone.
but I have no one.
if someone doesn't give me a good enough reason as to why I should stay. I won't
I want to stay, but I can't keep going everyday feeling so exhausted and battling the thoughts inside my head so if I don't get a good enough reason I'm going to end it.

"Like no matter how bright the sun is or how stable your life may be, you just feel sad or disconnected? Like there‚Äôs always a lingering sadness underneath everything?"
"I was diagnosed with depression about 21 years ago.  I worked at a job I didn‚Äôt like and I retired a year ago. Then money problems happened and could not pay for my cobra for health insurance.so I got another job for the health insurance and pay. This job is also turning into a job that I hate. The times that I feel good are very rare. I‚Äôve come to realize that when you‚Äôre depressed there is no hope of getting out of it. I‚Äôm just a pathetic human being whose wife never loved him and have no real friends. I wish I could kill myself but I‚Äôm so pathetic im scared to do it.
Please no, go to therapy. Been there 21 years and it doesn‚Äôt work
I‚Äôve Been on lots of medications over the years, none have work. 
I‚Äôm soooo tired of it. I want it to just end."
"I‚Äôm 27 years old and when I look back in my life, there‚Äôs nothing but regrets. I‚Äôve been a failure at what I have done in my past, never gave my 100% in anything, procrastinated everyday. Over the last 6 months I started many side hustles and gave up everything within a week because I lost the interest in it. It‚Äôs the been same story for years in other aspects of my life. And everyday I just question my existence in this world. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing now or what I wanted to do in the future. Over the years the one thing that always stayed with me consistently is being depressed. Unlike other people, I want to be in a state where im depressed, alone and separated from everyone. To be frank, I just lost hope in myself."
"Hello 29F,

My mum died in September 2022. Ever since then I live with my father and have a very strained relationship with my sister (who is now married).

I struggle everyday. I don't want to be alive anymore. I've attempted suicide 3 times and am thinking of just getting a knife slicing my throat. I do not want to be around people or anyone. I get no enjoyment out of work, socalising, anything. The only time I do enjoy is my time alone.

I do not have friends, or a partner.

I don't know what to do anymore."
"Whenever I think of this question, I feel as if I want to scream and tear apart my body. But I am too scared to actually do it. What are we? Where did we come from? What is this place? How many places are there in the universe? I used to think people who believed in God were stupid but at least they have some sort of delusional answer to all these questions but I don't. I just want to know why we keep on living. What's the point of this all? I've got dreams and shit but I can literally die any fucking day! So what's the point in continuing?? Why do we even search for meaning when we are literally just nothing. What are emotions what are we. I am going crazy oml."
I‚Äôm 21F I don‚Äôt have a will to live anymore . I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing with my life I can‚Äôt fucking get out of the bed even if I get out of the bed my body feels tired I got my degree back in September since then I didn‚Äôt look for a job I‚Äôm constantly anxious like my spine is shivering. I do have few friends that I can hang out with but I feel like I‚Äôm bothering them too much every time I ask them to hang out . I feel useless like am a burden for everyone around me . I feel like unaliving myself but I stop myself because my parents . They don‚Äôt deserve this .
Humanity is so awful and cruel and it makes me fucking depressed. Why the fuck did my parents think it was a good idea to bring a child here. I don't want to go on in this awful world. 
"I'll be honest and say sometimes I go without brushing my teeth for weeks. I work from home and am grateful because the idea of going out is a struggle. It even hurts to put myself in the bath tub or shower. I don't know what to do. I stay in bed all day, even with my laptop, because that is my safe space."
"I feel like all I do is make problems for people. I take the things I have for granted. I am not a good person.

I don‚Äôt want to die but I also don‚Äôt want to live. I‚Äôm too scared to commit suicide, I‚Äôm scared of death and I‚Äôm scared of hurting my family. But I‚Äôm also scared of living and continuing on as I am. I keep trying to be better so that I won‚Äôt be the shit person I am, but I feel like I‚Äôll never be a good person.

I really just wish I wasn‚Äôt born so I wouldn‚Äôt have to live and be scared of death.

I dont want to do this anymore."
"I am 25 years old, and I might as well be buried now. I have no goals, no aspirations, and no direction. I work at a job I hate, wasting my days going nowhere. I don‚Äôt know what I want to do or how to get there.

Every single advice I hear just sounds like a chore. Find hobbies, talk to someone, get therapy. I do all of that and nothing is enough. I am fucking tired. Nothing brings me joy anymore, my brain is sick. I have been feeling like this, on and off, for the past 10 years.

Just yesterday I miraculously had the idea of going back to school, this time for something I might actually enjoy. But a decision from 10 years ago prevents me from doing that, because I don‚Äôt even have enough necessary study hours to apply for the programme. Every fucking thing I do just reminds me what a waste of space I am. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about personal responsibility, you need to be disciplined because no one can live your life for you.‚Äù Yeah thanks! What if I don‚Äôt fucking want to get disciplined. I didn‚Äôt ask to be born, and so far, it‚Äôs not a great experience. I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôve lasted this long.

The worst thing is that I don‚Äôt think I am stupid. I just made wrong decisions and there is no going back now. I am burned out, tired and just so fucking over *trying* to be better. Therapy doesn‚Äôt help me. Friends can‚Äôt help me. And I just want to stay in bed, sleeping ideally, because every waking moment is a reminder of how much I suck at life.

On top of that, the world is in general a terrible place, and it will only get worse this century. Why the fuck should I stick around for that."
"I'm fucking suicidal again. I'm sick of this life. I don't wanna live. I managed to escape it for almost a year, but it's back. I can't get fucking help, no psychiatrists will give a vile tranny anti depressants. I'm a waste of space and should have killed myself years ago. Now I have people I love unlike before, so I can't even want to kill myself. I'm sick in the fucking head and I need help and no one will fucking help me. I'm too much of a pussy to cut, so I hit myself and bang my head against the wall. I just shouted at my dog to leave the room because I didn't want him to see me like this, and I feel awful. I want to die peacefully painlessly. I'm genuinely so tired"

"I‚Äôm trying hard to not go on social media today. I know the stuff people post isn‚Äôt always ‚Äúreal‚Äù and it‚Äôs just a highlight real, but even knowing that it‚Äôs still hard. It‚Äôs a reminder of how alone I feel during the holidays, and how I won‚Äôt be surrounded by people celebrating and having fun memories. I mourn the life I wish I had surrounded by family and love. I mourn my childhood memories of being a sad little kid on Christmas Day. Thinking about going the rest of my life feeling this way is hard. I wish I could just pretend like the holidays don‚Äôt exist."
"i just don‚Äôt understand. how can someone lie to you make u feel important understood and like they actually care about you make you trust them enough to open up, and when you finally do open up they use your biggest insecurities and vulnerabilities against you. people are fucking sick. people are so cruel. I am honestly not even surprised. It‚Äôs fucking terrifying how there are such terrible calculated people out there who just want to hurt you bc they are so fucked up themself. I do nothing but try to be nice to people and treat them with respect and i‚Äôll i do is get shit on every fucking time. I feel sick.  I am in disbelief that people can do stuff like that so easily. what the actual fuck."

"So I tend to browse r/therapists a lot, and there was an enlightening post about a therapist asking what to do with her clients who had already done behavioral activation out the wazoo and, surprise surprise, still felt depressed! I'm having this exact problem right now, so I started reading in hopes that there might be good advice.


And wouldn't you know it, almost all the comments were ""have you tried behavioral activation?"" ""Have you tried behavioral activation?"" Behavioral activation over and over again without even acknowledging that hey, these clients are already behaviorally activated! 

The worst recommendation that kept popping up imo was ACT, which essentially boils down to ""stop thinking about it and continue working"".

Therapists really have no idea what to do, do they?"
"How long have you been depressed? Has anyone been depressed so long that it‚Äôs just your way of life? It‚Äôs your normal? I felt shitty for so long that sometimes I wonder what it would feel like to feel normal. It‚Äôs not something that medication can fix. Certain life changes that completely alter your way of life in a negative way. Has anybody been depressed for so long and then one day gone back to normal? I think about it like a blind person finally getting glasses, or a deaf person finally being able to hear. I‚Äôd love to know what that feels like."

Some girls make fun of me because I talk proper but the guys at my school who sag their pants, curse a lot, and have very masculine, alpha-type personalities seem to have more success. Maybe I should be like them‚Äî I am so fucking useless. I can‚Äôt wait to die. Also, I just don‚Äôt fit the stereotype that girls seem to want in black teenagers: I‚Äôm not tall, I don‚Äôt play sports, so that‚Äôs kind of out of it for me what‚Äôs the point of living if no one‚Äòs ever gonna like me or love me. My mom passed away when I was eight years old, and I‚Äôm still not over it, though I probably should be. I live with my grandma, but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable telling her all this. I know it‚Äôs going to make her sad, but I feel like this is the only way I can find happiness. I just don‚Äôt want to live on this earth anymore. The only reason I haven‚Äôt done it sooner is that I am coward and a bitch. Also, I just have a problem defending myself when it comes to literally everything like there has been times when people have made fun of my mother and I don‚Äôt do anything but laugh at all for a walk away because I‚Äôm a bitch I know I should fight them but I‚Äôm such a bitch But I looked it up online, and it turns out that taking pills is a painless way to do it, so I think I‚Äôm going to do that tomorrow.

I graduated, I got a job, what now? 

It all just seems kind of pointless. I don't have any concrete thoughts of trying to end it all, but it's appealing I guess? The thought of disappearing and not existing anymore. I don't have to think about anything else. Just peace and quiet.

EDIT: I didn't think this post would have so many replies. But thank you for your efforts in giving me some answers. Some of these definitely made me think of what I really wanna do."
"Im 23 years old I haven‚Äôt been happy since turning 18. Sure I‚Äôve had happy moments but I‚Äôve never been truly happy in years. Everything I do I do to disassociate from life. I like video games and film because for that brief 2 hours where I‚Äôm immersed in whatever I‚Äôm playing/watching I feel alive. I smoke weed all the time because it helps quiet my mind and it allows me to not give a shit about anything. 

I don‚Äôt have a bad life. I‚Äôm fact most people would say I‚Äôm privileged. I have no past trauma that causes me to feel unhappy, It‚Äôs just how I feel. The only reason I haven‚Äôt deleted myself from life is because I live in the UK where we don‚Äôt have easy access to firearms. That and my mother doesn‚Äôt deserve to have to attend my funeral. A small part of me wishes she weren‚Äôt alive so I can finally give myself permission to kill myself.

I actually tried applying for the military in the hopes that I would die in war but apparently in the UK if you‚Äôre autistic you can‚Äôt join the military. I‚Äôve considered going to a shooting range but I feel that would be unfair to the staff. I just want to be happy but I‚Äôm stuck living in a world where no matter where I go I‚Äôm alone. I am an outcast even among other outcasts. 

I‚Äôve tried medication but that hasn‚Äôt helped. Therapists blame the way I‚Äôm feeling on the weed even though I‚Äôve made it clear to them that I‚Äôve felt like this long before I ever started smoking. I‚Äôve even quit all drugs including alcohol at one point but that actually just made things worse cause I became addicted to sugar instead. I pretty much cry every single day and even the thought of others being happy causes me pain. I hate Christmas and every holiday because of that reason. For me Christmas is just a reminder of how lonely I really am despite everything I have."
"People don't see how much I'm struggling or how deeply depression makes it hard for me to keep going. They assume I have all the means to be happy: I'm pursuing a master's degree, I have supportive parents who help me financially, and friends who genuinely care about me. But it's not as easy as they think. I'm dealing with severe depression and suicidal thoughts, which makes everything feel empty and meaningless. I don‚Äôt care about anything I do or have; I just want to peacefully end my life. The concept of ‚Äúliving‚Äù is unbearable to me. Sometimes I wonder if I'm being ungrateful, knowing others would love to have the chances I have. But even with these privileges, it still feels overwhelming and worthless. In the past 3 months I‚Äôve tried over 20 different antidepressants with no success, I‚Äôm beyond repair and doomed to live my life trapped with painful feelings. How can anyone endure this? Wouldn‚Äôt it be merciful to let me die? I feel suffocated and nothing can help me. "
"There is nowhere to go, nothing to do, nobody to talk to, no other time in the past to think about, that can make me feel better when I'm in a deep depression. 

A lot of people, from researchers and clinicians to laypeople, just fundamentally don't understand this.

  
It is imprisoning and panic inducing

Like I really lost the first 18 years of my life to this shit
"Noteworthy runner up for least favorite thing to hear: ""How are you?"" "
I think about killing myself a lot it like seems like a relief to me but I also know I‚Äôd never actually do it. I‚Äôm really scared of death so I have no idea why I think about dying so much at the same time I‚Äôm so confused
"Life isn‚Äôt that fun. The world is pretty evil and cruel. The only thing I really like a lot is my dog. I‚Äôm 32 now. And life only seems to get more miserable every day and every year. The world seems darker and more fucked up. People aren‚Äôt friendly. It isn‚Äôt fun. 

I don‚Äôt get the point. I don‚Äôt believe in God anymore. I think it‚Äôs stupid to believe there‚Äôs some sort of God out there allowing such immense suffering and such atrocities like children and animals being hurt. 

I don‚Äôt get it all. It‚Äôs so fucking hard to make real friends. I live in San Diego. And this is supposed to be basically as good as it gets. But it‚Äôs all kind of a fucking nightmare. It‚Äôs so so hard to be happy. I don‚Äôt get it anymore. 

I‚Äôm not suicidal. I‚Äôve been there and done that. But I‚Äôm really looking forward to dying. And pretty much forgetting all of this. 

I‚Äôm happy other people like it here. And seem to be having fun. I‚Äôm not a jealous person anymore. Good for them. I just can‚Äôt drink the Koolaid anymore. It all kind of sucks in my opinion. I don‚Äôt even want a wife and kids and the whole American dream anymore one day. What‚Äôs the fucking point? Bring kids into this world so they‚Äôre miserable too? No thanks.

These are my last moments. I'm Sorry I couldn't be better. Going to mix a bunch a vinegar with bleach in the bath tub to make sure it's finished. Don't want to wake up with brain damage and a ruined liver 
"Does life inevitably worsen as we age? Back in 2021, I use to reminisce about the pleasentness of pre-March 2020 life, worrying about the problems I faced in 2021. Now, in December 2023, the issues I faced in 2021 seem insignificant compared to the bigger issues at hand right now. Is this all there is? Will I be doing the same in a couple of years and fondly remember the 2023 days while facing future hardships? Is it only downhill now?"
"Is what I sometimes across. No I shouldn't, but it shouldn't be so hard that I can't even fucking eat or leave the house. Seriously, how do people put themselves through working all day every day only to come  home and do chores and sleep. I have a job but I don't really know how much longer I will have it. Even doing the washing up and brushing my teeth are mountainous tasks. Nothing is easy in life, but also nothing is even remotely doable."
"This isn't directly depression-related, but it is still related. Every day I get angrier, sadder and more hopeless. I'm done with hearing about all this shit. I hate humanity. Like come on, murder, war, terrorism, all this shit. I'm tired, and I'm fairly privileged. Like I actually want to leave earth (not die don't worry). I know I'm supposed to have hope and try to do my best and help others. But it feels like there's no point in the end. There's never going to be a perfect world. I know perfection isn't possible, but I feel like we can't even reach a GOOD world. I HATE THIS PLACE"
"lost my temper, and just blurted it out then actually felt better knowing that they finally know what i am thinking for so many years or maybe they already knew that i was mentally ill somewhat, their reponse? - they agreed with me, and said they also wish it was someone else in my place who actually cared for them and can support them financially then continued the lecture.. i am in my 20s and irresponsible, ungrateful, unfilial, unemployed, and if i add few more words myself then - anxious, depressed, ugly, alone and beyond saving at this point... because i can't change.



i find it quite funny :)

  
Edit: situation is getting worse, i'll be quitting if it gets out of control. we'll see :D"
"(sorry for the bad English, I'm Brazilian) Finding out yesterday that she was cheating on me with the same guy, only I was too stupid for us to notice, I loved her too much, but, every weekend, she said that she went to her aunt's house, which had no internet, and came back, and the excuse was that she had an illness, and I believed her, my friends said it was a lie, but I was very stupid, stupid, stupid, and I broke up with her because I didn't have time to talk to her anymore, because of the work that started early and ended very late, And that was at the beginning of 2023, in February, until yesterday, (February 10th) I discovered that she cheated on me, every weekend, and didn't go to her aunt's house, which never existed, it was a lie, But I loved her so much, I certainly believed in her, and yesterday I had a crying crisis, and I cried, I cried, a lot, I cried because I loved her so much, I was afraid of losing her, but I lost her a long time ago, I'm now lying in my bed, writing this on my cell phone while there's a puddle of tears on my face, knowing that my only girlfriend I ever had never really loved me, I just feel like the ugliest guy in the world, the most horrible guy in the world, I just want to lay in the arms of a girl who loves me, hearing her say ""I love you"""
At what point do phrases like ‚Äúbe happy‚Äù or ‚Äúget out of your head‚Äù become too much? I know your beloved ones want you to get better and not waste your time on being sullen and depressed but depression is not a switch. Now I no longer talk to anybody during my depressive episodes cause it‚Äôs too much.
"It‚Äôs all fucked up besides the millions of things that already made my life fucked this happened on paper his life was way better than mine idk if it was accident or not but it‚Äôs really fucking me up. 

It‚Äôs been 6 months but sometimes I can‚Äôt help 
But think about it. 

I just idk what I‚Äôm looking for I just wish I felt better. I used to wish for death and he has
It and his life was what seemed so much better than mine. But at the same time i feel like if I was better he‚Äôd be here I know it‚Äôs irrational but I‚Äôm just fucked up over it, and idk what to do. Idk why I‚Äôm posting this I‚Äôm just fucked up, cause this how I‚Äôm dealing I guess; I don‚Äôt even know anymore.

I feel like I‚Äôm expecting a miracle that‚Äôs never coming.

When I am distracted and occupied I can feel completely normal and happy but if the smallest bad thing happens(boredem does this for me too) It can ruin my day and set my depression on. Does anyone else have this? If so what helps you with it?
I work at a job where I am very outgoing and social and smile a lot. Known as the friendly one. But I also am seriously depressed and have lost interest in just about everything. My zest for life is gone. But being able to fake it at work always makes me question my depression. This happen to anyone else?
"I use to be a massive fucking nerd. I was into a lot of different tv shows, movies, and videos games but now the only way I can connect to my friend and his interests is through memory of the thing. I got tears of the kingdom for Christmas and I can‚Äôt find it in me to play it despite wanting to so badly at one point. Music was a main comfort but recently I started losing interest in that too. So I will have genuinely nothing left to be interested in when these things used to fuel me.

My friend also gets really depressed but is able to find comfort in these things. I know everyone is different but I can‚Äôt help but feel scared about what my lack of interest in anything means and what it says about where I‚Äôll end up. My favorite foods don‚Äôt taste good anymore and I don‚Äôt even draw anymore when that was my biggest hobby since I was 10.

Im honestly scared at this point. I don‚Äôt want to die I want to be happy but I can‚Äôt see myself making it to the end of the year."
"I don't have anything left to keep me going. I am completely alone in the world. I have no friends, no relationships. My family is fucked and there is no one I can rely on. The only person I talk to is my therapist just so I can give him 50 euro to tell me the same advice I could have gotten from the internet. Meds only make my dick numb. Realistically the only option I have to get some peace is if I off myself. Why would I continue waking up just to work every day and suffer? I am just waiting for all of this shit to be unbearable enough that I will finally have the guts to put an end to it. Fuck this world, I want out."
"please brush your teeth if you haven‚Äôt yet. 

When I was in a bad depressive state I would go a week or more without brushing my teeth. This lasted for months, I thought I was invincible because I hadn‚Äôt gotten any cavities and I just didn‚Äôt have the motivation to get up and brush my teeth.
 
Unfortunately, when I went to the dentist a few months ago, they told me all my teeth were showing the beginning signs of cavities and I needed to brush multiple times a day.

After this, I still would go days without brushing, until recently when I finally started brushing my teeth multiple times a day. It‚Äôs too late though, I know I have at least one cavity because my tooth aches so bad."
"Everyone has their thing. Their one thing, however small. Maybe you‚Äôre a good daughter, a good son, a good sister, a good friend, a good partner. Maybe you tend to do your work on time; maybe you keep up with a hobby; maybe you‚Äôre in university and you‚Äôre acing your classes; maybe you are outgoing in public. 
I‚Äôm a bad person in a way nobody understands. I can‚Äôt brush my own teeth. I can‚Äôt do my work. I don‚Äôt keep up with any of my relationships. My family doesn‚Äôt like me. I don‚Äôt have a one thing. I‚Äôm just such a bad person. 

So anyway. I don‚Äôt know if anyone‚Äôs had similar thoughts about themselves, but that‚Äôs why therapy has never worked for me. It‚Äôs hard to treat me when I make a really good case that I‚Äôm not a good person, backed by evidence and stories and relationships."
I‚Äôm so tired of everything. I‚Äôm in my 30s and I just can‚Äôt stand the thought of having to live any longer. I didn‚Äôt think I would make it this far in the first place. My brother died by suicide when he was 15 years old and I‚Äôm just so jealous that he got to check out early. I miss him so much but I‚Äôm also kinda glad he‚Äôs free and not in pain anymore. It‚Äôs been 17 years since he died and life just gets worse. Why do I have to suffer while he got free? 
"Im young. Yet all i do everyday is drink, scroll on my phone, be fatigued, breaking down, sleeping or at least trying to sleep. My mother found my scars and all she cared about wasnt my mental health but how others would react if they found out. About her reputation, she called me crazy and threatened to throw me to a psychward. Today i got caught drinking, they found a beer bottle in my room and got pretty mad. Havent been confronted for it‚Ä¶ yet.
When they do, i feel like i wanna open up. But whenever i try to i just idk. My throat starts to feel like barbed wire, my heart sinks, i feel a gut wrenching feeling in my stomach and a second later im holding back tears. I want to tell them how badly i need help, how close i am to ending it all. How miserable and dreadful i feel. How i need substances to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. How i had plans to kill myself. I want them to know and give me help, i really do. Nothing i want more than that. But idk, i just cant do it. I cant bring myself to it. But i feel though today once they confront me i will break down and tell them everything. "
I always think about killing myself but Ik it can be painful and unsuccessful. I would rather die outside of my control I can‚Äôt take this anymore. For years I‚Äôve been saying I can‚Äôt take it I have to kill myself but idk any good methods/how to make it look like an accident. Therapy doesn‚Äôt work and Ik I‚Äôm stuck like this and will never live a normal life where I‚Äôm moderately happy. I wish I could hire a hit man on myself how am I supposed to find one ?? What‚Äôs a good painless way to die I need tips
"Today crying at my day job. In the toilets now silently sobbing. Im almost 40 ive got nothing im living in a shitty apartment no bf no kids. Spent my days off laying in bed forcing myself to sleep to not deal with reality and not afford food.

"I graduated college a year ago. I made great friends during that time and I think I had some genuinely happy times. This past year I have been working in a grad job, living back at home with my parents in my small hometown and I just feel like my life isn‚Äôt worth living anymore. On a surface level, I have a degree, I make okay money, I live at home and don‚Äôt need to pay rent, I love my parents, I have 2 friends in this town. That should be enough right?

I can‚Äôt help but still feel incredibly depressed. I feel like I manifest it in a way, I am so negative and I understand this. I hate my job, I‚Äôm alone staring at a screen for 8 hours a day. Whilst I miss al of my friends and happy memories from college, I hate them. I resent them like hell. They‚Äôve all moved on to good jobs, big cities, big friend groups. When I‚Äôve reached out and they say they‚Äôre doing good, it makes me angry, why are they not struggling like me? 
I hold so much resentment towards good people. I cry every single night. I‚Äôm such a bad person. I have lashed out at every single person I love and most have walked away from me because of it. Rightly so. I am nasty, narcissistic, talentless. I‚Äôve never known love in a romantic way. I push everyone away. I just feel like I‚Äôm living a futile existence. I don‚Äôt want to be here but I still have an inkling of hope for change, a better future, happiness? I‚Äôve tried going to the gym, journalling, I even travelled for a month last year and I was still depressed. I‚Äôm holding on but it‚Äôs getting tiresome. This is the first time I‚Äôve tried to reach out to someone, anyone, I don‚Äôt know what to do."
"I can‚Äôt do this anymore, There is no reason for me to live any longer, I‚Äôve tried so much to find enjoyment in life and see the upside of the whole ordeal but I can‚Äôt bring myself around it. I am almost certain this will be my last text. I‚Äôm crying as I‚Äôm writing this, the world most certainly sucks and I am not gonna miss it one bit. Guess this is it then goodbye folks."
"I had a really great day today. Ate with friends, dressed all cute and did my makeup well. I laughed so much. I was genuinely happy. Then we chilled on a friend's apartment rooftop. That was when things started to change. I saw the distant lights and how the night sky was so dark. The lively streets from above. Even though I was with my dear friends, I felt at that moment that I wanted to die. My mood just changed. Everything feels the same again, like I would never change.

The happy me was real, but depression would still creep up to me. No matter what. There's no escape. I even talked to my friend about this and cried. I'm being vulnerable enough, the people around me accept me, yet I still want to die. Even when the environment around me changes in the most extreme way, I would still be my rotten self."
"Am I the only one dealing with this? Is it even related to my depression? I used to be smart, at least I think... then again idk maybe I never was to begin with.

I just can't process anything. My own mom just made fun of me for not properly understanding what she said. I want to tell her to f\*ck off ... how dare she think it's just a funny mistake to laugh at, it's an incredibly sad sign of how far I've declined. I can't work anymore, I can't think almost at all, sometimes I try to play chess and I literally cannot remember what I was doing for more than 10 seconds and then make a terrible move cause I TOTALLY forgot what I was trying to do. I can't read long reddit comments - if I see a long comment I stop reading after like 5 words. I can't focus and I'm always tired even when I get 10+ hours of sleep.

I feel like my IQ has been cut in half. Is this related to my depression? I really hope so. Either way I don't see how I ever recover... but it would be helpful to know I'm not the only one who feels this way.."
"Title says it all, I don't know what to do with my life anymore. Everything I try leads me to a dead end. I struggle in school, I struggle with relationships, I've driven a wedge between myself and my parents, I work a crappy retail job that barely pays my bills, I struggle with addictions, and I have no future aspirations. I don't want to keep on living, but I'm scared of what comes next. Truth is, the thought of dying terrifies me. It's really the only reason I haven't done anything yet. I still have that desire to improve myself deep down. I want to get better, I just don't know how anymore. The therapists I've tried didn't work. I've taken several different antidepressants, none of those worked. No matter what I try, I just can't get out of this dark head space anymore. I welcome any advice from others who have gone through similar situations. "

"Today was supposed to be a big event in my life. Something I worked on with a group of other people finally being released today, but I couldn't find the energy to leave my house, so I told them I couldn't come.

I'm bitter thinking now but I realise some of my life experiences where I rejected some really giving people because they weren't good enough for me.  
  
So, I'm 24F. Super introverted because coming from abusive family and was bullied at school. Unemployed because I couldn't learn skills on time for the tasks in my last job. Drowning in depression and low self esteem. I would heal with some good loving from someone I want. But no, that has never happened.  
  
Because people are shallow. You, me and everyone.  
  
I'm free now. Love isn't real and people pursue others for the feelings that will evoke them. It's not really unconditional. I no longer will pursue anyone or like someone because I'm tired of relating to taylor swift and lana songs with my fake imaginary boyfriend.  
  
I'm okay with leaving the earth someday having not experienced the true love.  
  
Love is for beautiful, confident girls with high self esteem and the type of girls that don't need the love. Not for me. And I'm okay with it.

"So, I am 37 and when I was 12 my friend died from an accidental gunshot wound when playing with  a gun we found in the house. I compartmentalized, buried, and just basically pretended I did  not witness my best friend dying in my arms.

I never got any help with a psychiatrist or any specialist just kept going. A year before this trauma my father died.  I think I also buried that pain also so I became far too skilled at burying my pain. At 12 or 13 I began smoking weed and it was amazing for me it helped escape reality and inevitably I got older and the spectrum of drugs expanded. 

Now after that little intro back to title I have been in bed for months I get up and walk my dog twice a day not for me its only for him.  I immediately go back to my bed and lie down and watch some random crap show . I don't feel sad I don't cry I don't think about my past often but, I just have zero energy to do basic tasks. 

I know I need to seek therapy or psychiatry I just don't really wanna take anti depressants . I know they just don't throw them at every patient and maybe talking and setting goals with them will do something..."
"As a 20 year old, I cannot relate to that at all. I never made friends in Uni (in my 3rd year) and I know I never will at all. It's hopeless. Seeing them having a good time makes me realise I cannot relate to them, and never will. This is the reality of the world I live in. 

It's times like this when suicide seems SO appealing. Fuck this shit man. I'm never gonna be happy"
"I work from home, all my friends are gone, I never leave the house. I wanted my husband to be enough to keep me happy so bad. But it's just not, I'm too much of a coward to kill myself but my life is miserable. And I couldn't handle knowing how the few people I do love would react. But I feel like I already died and my body is just dragging on, I cry everyday. Nothing feels like it matters anymore. I'm mourning all the lives I could've had while barely existing in the one I'm in now. I can't take it, too ashamed to talk about it in real life. I don't want to seem ungrateful for the things I do have."
"I hate to be alive, I wish I was never born. I can not stand being here. I hate all of it, the only reason I am not killing myself is because I don't want my family and loved ones to suffer. 

There are milions like me, I am nothing. This suffering is not worth it, I wish I was never born. Suffering and hardships might build some people and make them resilient, I am not one of them. 

I think suffering is inevitble, and is way more intense than any good, pleasure or contentment I have ever felt. I feel like being a human is a curse, and just a side effect of this cruel universe. 

Not existing would have been just fine with me."
I hate having period I'm scared of if I get pregnancy (if I even make my life that far) god please help me everyone hates me I want to die

I want to know what being appreciated feels like. I want to know what being wanted feels like. I give SO much positive light to others but people just come up and use it to heal themselves then leave once they‚Äôre better. 

I feel useless or invisible or both. I just want ONE connection in my life that is genuine and my level of love, thought, and care is reciprocated.

I sometimes think my purpose is just to keep helping others, even if they leave afterwards anyway. But I don‚Äôt want that purpose or existence. If I could do it without making others sad, I would kill myself immediately. But even tho people consistently hurt me, I never want to hurt anyone.

I‚Äôm so stuck and idk how to get out."

I am so happy for them, they deserve it all, but damn it hurts so badly as I watch from the outside. 

Why can't I? Why can't I have a good relationship with my parents? Why did my dad have to be an avoidant alcoholic? Why didn't I get a sibling to be able to share my parent trauma with? Why did the person I thought I loved betray me in the deepest way? Why can't I seem to be able to form and sustain relationships with anyone? What's wrong with me that no one can bare to love me? 

Though I get an occasional pity invite, they've all left me behind. Why would anyone want to be friends with a loser like me anyway. While they are building their futures, I am looking up noose tying tutorials on youtube."
"I hate evil. I hate pedophiles, and murderers, and other sadistic scum. I hate myself. I'm evil. I'm a scumbag that thinks about horrible things.

My mind is two, twin souls. There's me, and theres it. It thinks the worst, most vile, disgusting thoughts. Thoughts that need to be hung from a noose. I'm not even in control of it. I have to stop breathing to make it stop.

And then i'm just an asshole. I try to be a good person, but it's hard to. All i think about is how i'm either going to be in the Military, or an alcoholic. I can't be a good person. I'm inherently evil, and i hate myself for it. But oh, i'll seek righteous retribution one day.

I've been evil my whole life. My father never contributed to me, i never had any ""real friends"" until middle school. I can see why, it's impossible for good to like bad. If i'm infertile, it'll just prove that i am indeed a worthless human and that i need to be shot and killed"
" 

I'm a failure, 26 years old and have no friends and nothing. Except my parents I literall have no body to say goodbye to. All my friends were toxic so the friendship has ended. I found a friend on reddit but after 7 months, she just blocked me and gone. 

I'm also not good looking and have huge body dysmorphia and anxiety and shy. I'm mute and nobody likes talking to me. People hide their face when they're in front of me so I could not see them and it hurts. I always get rejected and always the last person that someone will talk to. People easily forget my existence even when I'm around them. I'm so ugly that people never wanna be friends with me or talk to me. 

Honestly I don't wanna get better as I have lost hope with life itself. I always wanted to be married and kid and do everything for them just to make them happy. I always imagined how my own family will be. It sucks that I'm just too loser to have a family. I don't want my child to think that I'm a loser but if my child ever sees me like this, he'll stop calling me I'm their father. I'm not fit or stable to have a family of my own.

I can die tomorrow and life will atill be the same for everyone. I'm already being forgotten by every living being that my death would change nothing in their lives. I'll quickly be forgotten by everyone just like how they've forgotten my existence even when I'm alive. There's no hope, there's no energy left in me. All I can think about is writing a suicide letter before I kill myself so my beautiful parents that were always there for me don't blame themselves for it. I want to see my parents happy always but then also I can't really take it anymore. They'll be hurt a lot but I can't ease their pain. I'm sorry."
I want to fall in love with someone who feels like home. We would do mundane things and call it the adventure of a lifetime. I want me and this imaginary lover to cuddle in bed and caress each other until all the pain inside washes away. 
"Thank god for this beautiful online community. I have been able to reach out to many souls that had seen the depths of mental pain. i felt for them, empathized with them, tried to comfort them. and through all that realized that sometimes it is better to just give up. I had always found a reason to live for the next day and so on. But now I am done.   
  
My papa is the only reason I ever reached the prime age of 28. Last weekend he left me without even saying goodbye and it kills me inside every day, every moment. I spent all that I had so I could just see him walk and hug me but. Its ok. That is life. Some people are not built happy. I didn't get the mental strength to see through this pain. I just can't live like this. It is easier to die.

Sky, my lovely lovely puppy, I can't financially take care of you anymore. I hope I find new owners for you before the weekend. You are the only reason I wish I could delay my passing but I am completely drained. I wish, i desperately wish, i could live for you sky. But I just don't have enough to not let you starve. You will be in better hands.

This Saturday I will go to the beach. I will see the sun set for the last time. I will thank this planet for hosting me for 29 years. I will think about mom, my pa, my sky. I am leaving this world with no guilt as there is no one left to care. Maybe I'll see my family. Maybe it is just the void.

I wish I could afford sky. I wish I did not know what depression is. I wish I didn't lead a sad life."
"I'm so tired of life. It gets shittier every year and just when I think it's getting better I get backstabbed by those I trusted most. I don't look forward to the future. I don't look forward to meeting people or hanging out, or going somewhere or doing something. I wish I had an excuse to lay down all day. I wish I had an excuse for this to end. I wish I had an excuse for people to treat me nicely"

"I don't know what to say, as the title says I'm a 16 year old guy and I feel very depressed, been feeling the same way for about 4 years. I've started drinking a lot recently these past few months to try and cope with my problems. I feel like I have no friends anymore, and I don't really talk to anyone at school, I feel like my parents don't give a shit about what I do and I just feel so lost. I try to act happy when I'm around other people, but it's just a fucking show, I want to kill myself so bad. I feel like I'm giving up on life. 

Thanks for reading, just needed to vent."
"For context I am teen in 12th grade and my final exams are coming up very soon and due to my less attendance my principal said he won't get me my hall ticket until I get good marks in preliminary exam .(they already took more than 5 premils)And I am not at all prepared for it(the upcoming prelim) I had a schedule to study and I was confident that I would get good marks in my finals but now I don't know what to do I am scared as well and thinking of committing a suicide tonight.  And that's not the only reason for it I have many more but at this moment the pressure is too much. From the start when I started attending this college I was only told to focus on entrance exam and in all those 2 years many  things happened. They told us not to worry about the final 12th exams they will tell us or take care of it but at the end they did absolutely nothing I have to do everything on my own and I am an average student so this all is just too much pressure for me 
Idk what to do I am in a very bad state rn istg I am goona die."
I have always felt trapped in my own body as if my soul is trying to break free. Since 4 months ago there hasnt been a day where i fantasized about it. Yesterday I bought rope and a stool but unfortunately for me the ceiling wasnt strong enough to hold me up. Ive been thinking about it a lot and i wish there was a way to end my life discretely without someone walking into the aftermath because they dont deserve to see any of that horror.

I'm a 26-year-old male with a degree in education (basically a teaching degree). I'm currently working as a virtual assistant in a third-world country. Man, it‚Äôs tough living like this. I feel like I'm getting old, but nothing good is happening‚Äîeverything feels stagnant. I have a low-paying job and can't even afford to take my girlfriend out. The worst part is that everyone keeps asking when I‚Äôm going to marry her since we've been together for about five years. The expectations from everyone are really pressuring me. Don't get me wrong, it's not my girlfriend's fault, but I pity myself because I‚Äôm broke. I can't even give her anything... damn. Sometimes I feel like it would be better if I die rather than dragging people through this messy, broke life. I hate myself for being broke. I‚Äôm grinding 24/7, but nothing seems to change. God...I'm a mess."
"Being lonely sucks, and it's making me lose what little sanity I have left.

One of the worst weeks of my life mentally... My mind is starting to normalize thoughts of suicide and it's really really scary..."
"the title says it all. i feel so lonely, ugly and hopeless and it gets worse every night and i so badly want to die though i would probably not be able to carry on with a suicide"
I'm 26 and still haven't cleared my bachelors degree while my cousin who is 4 years younger is going abroad for masters. god I am such an utter failure. I failed my parents. What did they do to deserve me
Wish I could just go to another world and live peacefully
"I‚Äôm (27F) convinced life is not worth living. I don‚Äôt know if life is different now compared to previous generations, but I genuinely can‚Äôt comprehend how people live long lives. Everything has become hyper individualistic, people have become so narcissistic, and so much joy is stripped from things that should be pleasurable. Am I wrong for thinking this? I genuinely don‚Äôt know how I will make it past the next few years. "

"I (30M) have no major issues in my life, good family, nice job, no debt. Currently living with my girlfriend(7years together). I've seen lot of posts here of people that have way worse than me. Im taking my antidepressants regularly, some vitamins, going to therapy weekly,  going to gym M-F every week. 

I just cannot feel happy, or in peace at least. I just feel like wasted my life, doesn't accomplished anything and made all the wrong choices. I just cant see myself in the future, cant set goals or objectives. Everyday I think about suicide and the worst is that I dont have a reason for this, I feel ashamed and guilty for being this way."

i genuinely hate god for giving me life and putting me on this fucking shit rock. My life sucks like fucking shit and I can‚Äôt be fucking bothered to care anymore about anything. I wish to just go to sleep and never wake up but I know that‚Äôll never happen.
I ve tried therapy before and it doesn‚Äôt work for me because I‚Äôm too stupid to listen to their advice and I‚Äôm a lost cause where my life will never get better and I‚Äôm worthless and unloveable and everything would be better if I never existed‚Ä¶..
"Basically filling up my time with nonsense I don‚Äôt care about and don‚Äôt want to do until I die, and I hate that. The problem is that I have ADHD and Depression, so nothing is interesting to me and I honestly hate everything to varying degrees. 

I honestly just feel like I‚Äôm waiting for my parents to die so I can get off the planet too. The two sort of friends I have have better connections with their other friends, and I have no interest in making friends or relationships. Everything seems so trivial and insipid to me. I don‚Äôt have passion for a career, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking that life is pointless no matter what kind of meaning I try to assign to my life.

**Can anyone relate?** I feel like shit and nothing is helping. SSRIs have never worked, and I recently tried ADHD medication which helps somewhat, but not enough to make me feel good about life. I don‚Äôt want to work, I don‚Äôt want to eat, I don‚Äôt want to go on a vacation, I don‚Äôt want to play video games, I don‚Äôt want to consume any type of media, I don‚Äôt want a car or a house or to climb the job ladder, I just don‚Äôt give a fuck about any of it. I feel useless and don‚Äôt even care that much. I‚Äôd rather die now than work tirelessly for 40+ years then die in retirement, or die in a freak accident along the way."
"I need help and some days I desire it, but I‚Äôve isolated and self sabotaged to the point where I don‚Äôt know what to say to anyone who was in my life.

"Hi guys! Despite it being my 17th birthday today, I found myself crying alone in a ball by the end of the night. No matter what happens I seem to end up by myself. At the end of the day, I want someone to want me. I just need to know someone cares. I don‚Äôt know how to feel okay with myself when I feel rejected by my peers and society as a whole. I‚Äôm not sure what to fix about myself, I hate the fact that I‚Äôm so fucking shy but I can‚Äôt do much to solve it, and when I do speak I can come off as mean and feisty and unladylike. I hate myself. This feeling is terrible. "
"So, yesterday night during rush hour when people usually travel home, someone committed suicide by jumping in front of a major train line which caused delays. My sister and I had to take different routes to our respective homes. Today when I woke up, my sister‚Äîafter dropping her kid to daycare‚Äîcame to visit us and was talking to my grandparents in our living room (I was still in bed and could hear them talking). Here‚Äôs the conversation:

Sister: why do they have to do such a thing which will inconvenience so many people when you can do it for free at home? Are they not thinking?

Grandma: They‚Äôre not thinking. That‚Äôs why do it. 

Grandpa: What happened?

Sister: Someone jumped in front of a train yesterday.

Grandpa: That‚Äôs so stupid.

Grandma: Why don‚Äôt they just jump into the sea or something? 

I was shocked by how insensitively and nonchalantly they spoke of someone who fucking died‚Äîsomeone who felt so alone that they chose to take their life. I‚Äôve been aware of how insensitive my family are about people who suffer from depression or commit suicide, but today I‚Äôve truly realized what huge assholes they are. I‚Äôve been suicidal for over fifteen years now, I cope with life by self-harming and have been doing it for fifteen years. 

My mom knows (though she doesn‚Äôt know the scope of how much I cut). It‚Äôs definitely been a couple of years since we talked about my depression and I‚Äôm convinced that she thinks I‚Äôve stopped cutting. My sister also knows that I cut, but I guess she doesn‚Äôt really care cause she never asks. I don‚Äôt care that she doesn‚Äôt care, because once upon a time when I was naive enough to confide in her, she told me to ‚Äújust be happy‚Äù and that there are people who are actually truly suffering in the world, so I should just think positively about life.

I still go to a psychiatrist but apparently everyone has forgotten that I‚Äôm still getting help. Every minute of waking life is spent thinking about killing myself‚Äîit‚Äôs rare that I can distract myself from it. I‚Äôm not even thirty yet and I want to die. I do have a feeling that someday I will take my life‚Äîit almost feels like fate. Hearing my family speak about suicide like that made me feel like maybe I should just get it over with. 

P.s.: I‚Äôm not looking to be consoled or comforted, or seeking help. Just wanted to share cause this sub is the only place where someone will understand how diabolical my family is. "
I went into another episode at the beginning of April‚Äî at the tail end of the semester. I couldn‚Äôt finish school because I was depressed and couldn‚Äôt do anything. My hygiene is poor and i‚Äôve lost ~ 10 lbs. I even got a kidney infection from not taking care of myself. It‚Äôs really a struggle. 
"At the moment my mind is looping non-stop as I think and fantasize about painting my bedroom walls red with a shotgun. Suicide is the only thing I‚Äôve been able to think about lately. It‚Äôs the only thing that has brought me any remote sense of peace and comfort. Knowing that I have the option to end it all is such a comforting feeling.

It feels like using a security blanket as a child. I can finally feel at peace with myself."

"As per the title, I am sad, very depressed and tired and hopeless  (I am already in therapy). I don't  want to die, but I don't  think I will ever be happy, so I feel like I should kill myself, I can't  be happy either way so I might  as well make sure I am not suffering anymore.

"I‚Äôm homeless in France (with my dad) because we weren‚Äôt receiving help or meds. I have no friends. My country and home country aren‚Äôt helping me.

"I can have moments where I feel happy and excited. Where I feel normal. Then, the distraction causing those feelings goes away and, BOOM, depression takes over everything like flipping a switch. In seconds I'm engulfed in that familiar darkness and every day of light is snuffed out.

How does it happen so fast? How to I stop it? I can't distract myself every waking moment. How?"
"I can't handle living with the kind of autism I have! I can't handle zany cartoons really aside from maybe some exceptions. I can't handle SpongeBob after the first season. I can't even handle seasons 2 and 3. Even if I respect people's opinions and they respect mine, I still feel horrible for not liking the show or movie afterward and feel like beating myself up

I really want to get some alcohol and overdose on it because I can't take this anymore! I hate feeling this way! I hate how stressed I get from certain shows! I hate how easily upset I get! I want to die! and maybe in another world when I am revived, I will love SpongeBob and all the shows that stress me out! I feel like a stupid person!"

I've been self harming for a little over 10 years off and on, just in a year ive been r\*ped again, kicked out, moved back in with my dad (love him for that lol), went no contact with my sister who i lived with prior, and little to no contact with my mom (maybe talk two time a year), and i just have a fucked life/past, idk how else to put it.

You failed as a parent and you're failing to give us the will to live by our own.

Screaming and beating my dad. Who got 3 strokes and developped blatant signs of dementia.  
You're making our life, miserable.  
My dad needs to get hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital or specialized hospital for the elderly, crazy people.

You need to see a therapist, like I'm trying to do.  
You need to stop pushing me over the cliff, each day, threatening me almost every day of committing suicide.

You've given me life to keep me as a toy.

"25F, 26 in a few days actually. 

I don‚Äôt know how common this is but I find that I‚Äôm completely frozen when I want to do something with my time. Like for example, I feel comfortable napping and lying around on my phone, but when I get bored and want to play video games or do something, I get a spike of anxiety/I get more down and don‚Äôt want to do it. Almost like I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm going to fail at having fun or something. Or that it‚Äôs a chore. Like there‚Äôs some invisible barrier preventing me from doing anything but things my brain has deemed ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.

It sounds so stupid when I type it out like this‚Ä¶ why can‚Äôt I do anything? Why is the idea of picking up a controller fear-inducing? I haven‚Äôt completely lost interest in everything just yet but I can‚Äôt do anything except for, well, sleep and look at my phone. It‚Äôs been like this for a few months now but I‚Äôve been slowly declining for the past few years.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about people struggling to do things because of a complete lack of interest, but never about wanting to do things but feeling weary of it to the point where it just freezes you. I don‚Äôt know. Just some thoughts I wanted to throw into the air because I feel very alone with this strange feeling."

"I‚Äôm not even suicidal in a hopeless sort of way, it‚Äôs more like living just doesn‚Äôt seem to be for me? Disinterest? Like some people enjoy parties, others don‚Äôt. I feel like I‚Äôm just waking up because I have to, because it‚Äôs what‚Äôs expected. There‚Äôs no excitement, no reward. 
I‚Äôd say I want to live because my family and friends, or because I‚Äôd miss being able to experience a specific experience, or because I‚Äôd be scared to hurt my loved ones, but I really don‚Äôt care that much.

I‚Äôve attempted twice before, and each time I told myself it would get better, but I truly feel like a part of me *did* die on those nights.

How do I fix something that isn‚Äôt there? "
"Life is so unfair. 

I‚Äôm a 30yo male. I have a decent job on a farm. My wife works in retail. We have 4 children. We had 5. Cancer stole one from us and things have never been the same. When my son was diagnosed with a very rare brain cancer we were financially stable but after staying in the hospital for 9 weeks while waiting to find out what was going on, we pretty much lost it all. But we did our best to persevere while our sweet son fought this terrible illness. I continued to work hard and we actually bought our first home during his battle with cancer. In December of 2022 he lost his battle and things were so terrible. My wife didn‚Äôt leave her bed for over a month. I finally began seeing light in her eyes again in May of 2023. We took her mother in who was in recovery from addiction and for the first time in my wife‚Äôs life her mother was her best friend. Clean and sober. Then we came home from church on June 4th 2023 and found her mother dead in the same room her son took his last breath. Heart failure. My wife was distraught. Suicidal and refusing help. I have barely kept us afloat financially. Our circle is small so I‚Äôve pretty much had to deal with everything on my own. While trying to hold my wife above the metaphorical river of life that was drowning her. We live in south Mississippi in the same house her son and mother passed away in and we know we want to get out. Drop everything. Our other children are homeschooled due to the immense amount of trauma they‚Äôve endured. We are planning to move across the country at some point. Working paycheck to paycheck I don‚Äôt know how. We are going to try and sell our house. Maybe we‚Äôll turn a profit. I took on a second job 3 nights a week and I donate plasma twice a week. We‚Äôre just down and out right now and are praying a change of scenery will put some pep back in our step. If anyone has any questions or needs advice I‚Äôd love to help someone if I can. I‚Äôm saying that I need good vibes and prayers if possible. Thank you. "

"24m. I attempted suicide a few weeks ago, and I have a plan for it again. I lost everything. Both my furbabies of 4 years, I lost my job working with special needs patients which was the most rewarding work ive ever done. I lost the two people who were the closest and only people I had for two years, simply because of the pain I go through, and because i attempted suicide. All in the same week. I went into a suicide attempt thinking I'd lose it all, just to come out of it realizing I truly did lose everything.
This has happened so many times, and i've been nothing but vulnerable, respectful, and supportive to them, to everyone. That's why it hurts so much. If If was just selfish, unwilling to be cecpiteble to change, I wouldn't of been the one abandoned, or hurt. Unfortunately I couldn't even do it if I tried. 

I've tried to be a loving person, but I have nobody left to care about. Its left me so broken. All ove wanted out of life, is to love, and be loved. Maybe thats my biggest problem. I dont see people for what they are or their past, I see pepople for what they can grow into. So i miss all of the red flags.

Im gonna die anyway maybe around 65. I wish to have a decent life but I could just shoot myself. But im not brave enough. See, im a pussy, i cant even commit suicide. Only hope i have is that lot of woman are attracted to me. I have no idea why, maybe good looks. That's all that matters."
"i'm 17, perfectly abled, i have resources, my parents have money, i could do anything i wanted but my mentality is holding me back. I had all the time in the world to improve myself and somehow i'm still a fuckup burden all because i'm too afraid to try new things."
"I mean even now at 30 I feel like I‚Äôm pushing it. Unless you get snatched up before 22, it seems the genuine consensus is you are a worthless expired old hag. I‚Äôve never even beautiful so what‚Äôs the point?

I am still talking to somebody but it‚Äôs hard to imagine anyone finding me attractive as an ugly worthless hag "
"I've been depressed since like 2022 I think. I thought last year was better, it felt pretty stable though I was rarely happy. I was studying Philosophy and Japanese in college and after graduating this year I had plans to move to Japan with my boyfriend and stay here one year.

I was really unsure about it, but I put it down to just being scared as I usually am. While preparing for the move I was very stressed and felt pretty bad in general, but I thought that after arriving it would get better. And well, we came here like two weeks ago and not only did it not get better, it got like a hundred times worse.

We're in Osaka, which is a big city and I've underestimated the toll such a place could have on me - I'm from Europe and my country's big cities are like small towns compared to this. I feel trapped, all the things that seemed fascinating to me before now seem foreign and scary. I don't enjoy almost anything here, even though I was looking forward to it before. I cry everyday and my suicidal thoughts came back after being gone for one year. I miss my home, family and friends very much. I have my boyfriend's support and he tries to help, but he likes it here and doesn't really understand how I feel. I know it's hard on him as well and that makes me feel really bad. 

I try to do things everyday, go out, I even found a job and my first day is next week. I'm terrified though, I don't know if I can do it with how weak and fragile I feel all the time. I'm really scared that I'll break down during my shift or something and well, since Japan is known for its stigma around mental illness I don't know how my colleagues and boss would react. A few days ago I broke down during a get-together at our house with some friends and had to leave. I sat in a nearby park and cried on the phone to my mom for over three hours until everyone left. 

I wanna go home so bad. Almost everyone says that it's hard at first and it'll get better after I settle in but I don't know how long I should wait until that happens. I try so hard to like it here and nothing helps, at best I feel okay sometimes, but still I feel awful everyday and I can't see it getting better in the slightest. 

I don't know what to do anymore, I feel so hopeless and scared. "
"I feel overwhelmed by everything. I just graduated college and I feel just as stuck as I was my whole life. I‚Äôm not ready to be an adult. I‚Äôm way too sensitive to be a living human. Finding a job is too much right now. I can‚Äôt do anything without my parents help. I still feel like a fucking kid. I miss being a kid. For the past 2 years as a co-op at my ‚Äújob‚Äù, I have not learned a single thing. Everyone hired at the same time as me have learned much more and are more passionate than I‚Äôll ever be towards anything. I can‚Äôt get a grasp on anything and feel like I went down a too difficult of a career path to pursue. Every time I‚Äôve been in an interview, they ask me about my knowledge of things and I‚Äôm just making stuff up so I actually don‚Äôt know anything about anything. I‚Äôve never felt so stupid before. I constantly need someone holding my hand or else I break. I‚Äôm so not ready to move out of my parents house and have more responsibilities, since I already feel overwhelmed with what little I do. I‚Äôm not ready to be an adult and I don‚Äôt think I ever will be. I wish I never got a cat so I don‚Äôt have to feel guilty for leaving her. I wish my mom hated me so I don‚Äôt feel awful for ending things on my own terms. I bought the material needed to end my own life today. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever go through with it, but I feel more closer to it than I‚Äôve ever felt before. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. I don‚Äôt know. I just know it‚Äôs too much work to ‚Äúfeel better‚Äù and I don‚Äôt have the motivation or energy to change it. It would just be easier to be deceased.

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm writing this. I guess I just don‚Äôt want to feel so alone."
"Yesterday, I knew I would go across a railroad. So I planned to jump in front the train. When I was standing there on my bike, the lights turned red so that means a train was comming. I was looking left and right to know where I should stand. When I saw the train I froze completly and didn't move. All what I did was shaking from fear and regret. It's so hard, I was littlery on the edge of going to die. Unfortunatly"
"Need to just vent and get this off my chest. Exactly as the title says. Last night I was hanging out with my girlfriend (who is amazing and is the reason I am still here) and I had just purchased some edibles online and they had arrived the day I went to see her. These edibles were some of the most potent edibles I had ever seen (7000mg in a bottle of 40 gummies, or 175mg per gummie). I am not an active user of THC or edibles, so I should have taken the recommended amount, which was half a gummy. Instead, I took 1 and a half gummies, because I have been struggling with my mental health a lot recently with PTSD and just horrible depression lately, and I was honestly hoping that I would end up overdosing and passing away (there was much more than just THC in the gummies, so it could possibly have killed me). I don't even remember a lot of what happened. From what I heard from my gf, I was turning pale, and my lips were turning purple/blue, and I was becoming unresponsive. She called 911 and I ended up in the hospital. I don't really remember a lot of what happened, I ended up in different clothes, vomited several times, and for a moment I truly think I passed away (I was seeing a bright white light, but idk if that was from encountering death or just entering the hospital). Eventually I made it back home, and I honestly don't even remember getting home, or even leaving. I just remeber getting into the back of an ambulance, and whatever is mentioned above. But the part that I hate the most about last night was that I was hoping I would die. I wanted to pass away. In front of my girlfriend. I just feel even worse than I ever have, I truly hate myself and what I did to my girlfriend who deserves nothing but the world. And the worst part is, I still want to kill myself. Anyways, that's it. If you read all this, thanks for listening. I just needed to get this off my chest."
"The mere fact that depression, fear, worry, sadness, guilt, anger, discomfort, shame, anxiety, and every other unwanted and negative feeling is not only caused by external sources in the real world, but is also reinforced and perpetuated internally by our own minds via memories, thoughts, and imagination is fucking overwhelming.

I can accept being depressed by outside forces I can‚Äôt control. Fine. (Well, not really, but still‚Ä¶) But I absolutely hate how I can rarely find any peace when I‚Äôm alone, when objectively, it‚Äôs a nice morning, the birds are singing, I‚Äôm eating a nice meal, and I have time I should be relaxing or doing something I enjoy, but none of that feels good because my mind is just constantly reminding me how I‚Äôm broke, how my ex left me nearly 5 months ago, how difficult it is to even get out of bed and be productive, how much my OCD intrusive thoughts also attack me from every angle, so on.

The way the mind works, anything we imagine, if it‚Äôs negative, be it a ‚Äòfuture prediction‚Äô or a memory of the past, it triggers our fight-flight-freeze response exactly the same way as if there was actually something urgent and dangerous in front of us.

I am fucking sick of always feeling on edge, scared, anxious, and worried. I know logically that thoughts aren‚Äôt dangerous, but I just don‚Äôt want to think at all. I don‚Äôt want to be reminded how shitty things are around me. I just want to relax."
"There‚Äôs so many people with way worse problems. I‚Äôm healthy (I think), financially stable, and safe. 

But I‚Äôm really lonely. I enjoyed being single in my 20s and 30s but now it‚Äôs different. Before I had hope. I had a few serious girlfriends and could meet people easily but now my looks have faded, and it‚Äôs been several years since I‚Äôve had any kind of girlfriend. 

I‚Äôm 43 and I truly think I‚Äôll be alone forever and it‚Äôs so depressing and terrifying. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll ever take my own life but every night I hope that I won‚Äôt wake up the next morning. I have almost no appetite and no longer find any joy in the things I used to love doing. I really just feel awful. "
"I know nobody cares. I know it won‚Äôt get better. I know not a lot of people can actually relate to my situation.

I turned 22f yesterday. I thought I was doing better and healing, but past month I hit depression real big. I‚Äôve had depression for years, but never like this.

I‚Äôm so tired of being nobody. I‚Äôm so tired of being so poor that sometimes I have to eat plain pasta for few days. I‚Äôm not alright.

I‚Äôm a French immigrant that doesn‚Äôt speak French, even tho I speak English. I can‚Äôt get a job. 

I‚Äôm Ukrainian, my hometown is occupied and I haven‚Äôt been there in 3 years. I don‚Äôt talk to my family because they‚Äôre abusive and it took me 2 years to heal from the emotional abuse they put me through.

I live with love of my life and 3 years ago I thought running away from my country to live with him will make me happy, but the truth is I‚Äôve never felt so miserable. Not bc of him! 

Ah, I‚Äôm too tired to talk about all the sh*t that happened. I just want to end it. I hate myself so much. I hate where I am in life rn. I thought I was improving and then I realized I wasted 3 years of my life. It‚Äôs not gonna change, is it? 

I want support. I want validation. I want people to care about what I came through, even tho I know there‚Äôre people that have it worse. 

Nobody will probably read it. Nobody cares. I really should kill myself. I pray to god I don‚Äôt believe in to kill me in my sleep. I know he doesn‚Äôt exist. The only person that can make it better is me. I wish I had a gun‚Ä¶ I hope my fianc√© won‚Äôt go crazy with grief when he sees my dead body. He deserves so much better than a useless depressed piece of sh*t like me.
"
"Killing myself is the only option going forward. I'm writing this not to find sympathy or pity, nor do I mean to glorify self-harm, I'm simply telling you all what this is like.

It's like being trapped in a burning building and people give you useless advice to try and escape when, really, the only option is to jump out of the burning building. And unless you're actually in the position where you know objectively that you need to remove yourself and end your own life, you have zero idea what it's like to burn in your own mind and reality.

Medication has not helped me find joy or happiness of any sort. Self-improvement has done absolutely nothing for me. Therapy has been the biggest time waster and given me zero monetary gain. Gym will help with your energy levels, focus and discipline but it otherwise has not filled the gaping hole left in my soul. Getting rid of myself is the only way to actually find peace, and I am going to kill myself to relieve myself of this terrible suffering that's overwhelmed my life."
"I'm being completely serious, like, fucking hell. If I were a turtle, at least I wouldn't have to deal with this stupid thing called human life. Life is pain, but as a turtle? Nothing happens. I just get to walk around, sleep, and eat. WHAT DOES A HUMAN DO? Taxes, depression, school, working until we die? Fuck human life. I want to be a damn turtle. Humans have evolved too much and need to be dumbed back down to cavemen so we don't experience this shit in the first place. God, I hope Buddhism was right, and when I die, I get turned into a fucking turtle. God, I hope I die soon. being nonexistent would be better than this. Fuck this shit, just kill me now. Fuck me. I don't want it to come to that, but damn, it might just fucking will. What's fun about this? What's the good side? I don't feel ""happy."" I just get everything I love ripped away from me. I don't want to lose anything else. I want to be carefree, with no responsibilities. I find it horrible that I can't just be who I want to be. I can't just be happy. Human civilization is a trap, a cage locking me away from anything I want to do. As I said once and will say again I wanna be a turtle."
"34M, I don‚Äôt know, I just can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt truly happy. It‚Äôs a debilitating feeling‚Ä¶"
"happy people are so fucking happy all the fucking time. they seem to have everything sorted out and they look up to the future with hope and have dreams and ambitions and living for them is joyful, every day is not a burden. it's my 20th birthday today, and I'm crying all alone. it was supposed to be the happiest day of the year for me. a happy person would be overwhelmed with joy if it was their birthday today. but no. I'll never feel what that joy feels like. I'm cursed with this sickness. this perpetual sadness that engulfs every living moment of mine. no will to live whatsoever. scared to imagine the next day. too tired wishing this day would end. and living in this state of mind for almost a decade. what did i do to have this cursed fate - I'll never know. something's wrong with me. i cared so much for people. remembered their birthdays and wished them at midnight. very few remembered mine. because who tf am i, right? some worthless piece of scum. i probably deaerve this what's happening to me. I'll never know what its like to be truly happy, and maybe i never will. maybe i never should .

hadn't cried since a long time. but the day i cried had to be my birthday. just great. "
The bad memories are killing me.
"I‚Äôm too cowardly to do anything, but the only semblance of anything is when I‚Äôm in bed. Even in bed I feel that crushing heaviness, the darkness, the sheer lethargy creeping through my veins, but at least I‚Äôm covered by something soft and I am alone and soon I will not be conscious and drift off. 
Every single action is like slogging through a bog, each step sucking at you as you slowly sink ever deeper. 
My body just feels so heavy and dark and tired all the time. It hurts physically to fake a smile. I don‚Äôt want to do anything but sleep. "
"People are confusing, I don't get them, if I try to match their energy, I ended up being too much for them??, but if I just stay quiet, I'll end up being called a killjoy. if I go along with their humor, they'd criticize me or something, like I'm wanting attention. Should I stop making friends and stop talking to my old friends?"
Every second of my life I am uncomfortable. Even if Im trying to be social or do something fun it‚Äôs always in the back of my mind. Nothing makes the bad thoughts go away. It seems so easy for other people to just do things and interact with others and I can barely motivate myself to get out of bed. I try to make friends but socializing is unbearable at times. I usually just rely on escapism to keep me sane but after it just reminds me of what I‚Äôll never have.
"I just realized recently this is all I have and all I ever do with my free time. Whether it's a movie, show, game, manga or whatever all I ever do with my free time is consume media. I genuinely have no other hobbies or passion for anything else except media. It's no wonder I probably seem so weird and different to other people because I have no idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need some sort of fictional media just to keep going because it keeps me from realizing how bad my life has gone to shit and all this time passed and I haven't really changed at all. Usually when I spend enough time consuming I forgot about how depressed, miserable, and lonely I am and sometimes makes me even feel good. Unfortunately it's all just so mind numbing and it's like filling an empty void.  

&amp;#x200B;

I just can't even fathom what else there is out there for me. I genuinely have nothing except this. This is my life. Just another youtube video, movie, show, game and I keep looking forward to the next thing to numb my brain to the absolute shithole my life has become. Is there anything I can do? It feels like I can't save myself from this horrible hole."
"I cry five times a day because of how much I hate college. The equivalent of work I have to do is basically two full-time jobs. I constantly have to ask my professors computer questions because I always run into problems. I have had so many frustrations such as bad professors, bad group project partners, and having to buy a whole new computer just to download one program. I am now super behind on everything because of how many computer issues I have had. I wish you got paid millions of dollars for working at Walmart because I'd honestly rather do that at this point. I'm pretty fed up with everything going on at this point and I'm really scared I won't be able to finish everything. I hate college so freaking much. I honestly don't know how some of my classmates can walk into class without having a frown on their faces. I'm constantly pissed off 24/7 because of all the issues I'm having. "
"I don‚Äôt enjoy anything, really. Like I hate everything. My old hobbies bore me to death. I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I am literally losing my mind. I am tired all the time and have no energy to do anything other than laying in bed all day. I feel like i am being crushed by some invisible weight. I can‚Äôt even cry. "
"I‚Äôm a 19 years old woman, I know I‚Äôve been through hell during my childhood, but now that I finally got the courage to speak about it to my family, they keep blaming me, telling me it‚Äôs normal for kids to develop traumas during that age, and that they should just overcome it by themselves, like they did. My mom knows I was sexually abused by my brother, I told her once many years ago, and never brought that subject up ever again, until some days ago, and guess what? She blamed me, saying I should never be accusing my brother like that, because HE would get hurt; what I went through, was normal, and she thinks it‚Äôs not normal for me to reject his hugs and compliments. But that‚Äôs just the peak of the iceberg, I have so many other things going on, I don‚Äôt even know how the fuck I managed to finish highschool, considering the fact I dropped it once because my mental health was just so bad I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to go there. During the year that I dropped, I went to many therapists, and I got diagnosed with BPD. I took my meds for some time but my mom didn‚Äôt believe me, didn‚Äôt believe I have this mental issue, she thinks I‚Äôm just crazy, overdramatic and stuff, so she took me off my meds and didn‚Äôt buy them anymore (i was a minor). She then decided to take me to the family ‚Äútherapist‚Äù instead, whom after hearing about my self harm problems, said that I was doing it for attention, because if I wasn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd be cutting way more deeper. 
Now, I can barely take it anymore, I‚Äôve developed a severe eating disorder too, and each time I eat a little more than I ‚Äúshould‚Äù, I feel so sick and disgusted by myself that I have to take a freezing cold shower just to try and feel ‚Äúclean‚Äù. And i can barely sleep too, I‚Äôm having really bad insomnia, which is just ruining my body and I can physically feel it.
I can‚Äôt even go to a therapist, I‚Äôve been asking my parents for years, but they just told me to ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù and to solve my problems by myself. I have no money, so I can‚Äôt afford to go to one, and I won‚Äôt even try the free ones cause I already know they‚Äôre useless. 
I don‚Äôt even have one friend, I‚Äôve spent all the fucking summer in my room, pondering, scrolling on my phone trying to avoid the empty feeling in my chest, but I just can‚Äôt anymore. And the funny thing is that, I used to have a lot of friends, but I‚Äôve always been the one to push then away, to distance myself, I‚Äôve always been the one who ruins everything, and I don‚Äôt fucking know why. I‚Äôve done this all by myself, and now it‚Äôs too late.
I have so many other things I could say but I don‚Äôt wanna drag it out too much, I just know i‚Äôve come to peace with my self, because I‚Äôm aware it will never get better, it only gets worse, so I‚Äôm just gonna end it. Life just isn‚Äôt for me, I‚Äôm too weak and pathetic."
"I‚Äôve never met anyone as selfish as me. I have so many people that strive to be my friend but I‚Äôm so cold back to them. I can‚Äôt help it. It‚Äôs not that I think I‚Äôm better than most people or something, it‚Äôs mostly that I don‚Äôt want people to get close to me I guess. I‚Äôve just never really cared about anyone or anything. Im not even eighteen yet and I can‚Äôt ever see myself graduating, going to college, getting married, having kids etc. I have all these opportunities and I just don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm also mean for no reason, I don‚Äôt know why people haven‚Äôt just left me to be by myself yet. And I know it‚Äôs easy to think ‚ÄúWell, why don‚Äôt you just be more welcoming?‚Äù but I‚Äôm not even sure how I can do that when I don‚Äôt know how to bond with people. I don‚Äôt really want to bond with anyone anyway, people have always really been an inconvenience for me. I‚Äôm not sure why, I‚Äôve never had many lasting longterm goals that relationships might damage. I hate myself so much I wish I could just disappear. I know I hurt people all the time and I don‚Äôt even mean to. I‚Äôll never be able to give someone the love they need, and I‚Äôll die alone for sure. I‚Äôm starting to give up. Even though I have someone who loves me, I don‚Äôt even trust them enough to open up. I already feel as if I am not faithful to them. When I was a child, I was groomed by older men for a while. Now, I can‚Äôt help but only want someone older than me even though I know it‚Äôs morally wrong. I‚Äôve hurt myself and others for too long and the guilt is unbearable. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I have the sickest most disgusting mind Ive ever thought someone could have."
"I've been depressed for more than half of my life. I'm still young but I made so many mistakes. I'm not getting better. Even when I feel okay, I just have this knowledge that I will be the one to take my own life. It feels inevitable. One day, I'll reach my breaking point and hurt myself.

I don't know how much of this I can take. Living is so difficult and it's not worth it. 

I recently started a new job, in a new place and I'm already fucking up. I feel like a completely different person. I'm sleeping too much and incredibly anxious. I don't know why I can't fucking function and I hate myself for being so worthless. Everyone will be disappointed in me if I ruin this opportunity for myself. I don't know how to feel okay again. I'm having intense thoughts of hurting myself. None of this feels real."
"6 therapists, behavioral therapy, psychoanalysis, almost 10 different antidepressants, 5 inpatient hospital stays, sleep deprivation, dietary changes, no more alcohol, I have changed my environment and now even undergone electroconvulsive therapy. Nothing has improved my depression for more than a few weeks .

My depression is considered treatment-resistant and my doctors tell me that I am still so young (22) and that my whole life still lies ahead of me. As if that wasn't extremely scary. 

I feel so hopeless and heartbroken"
"I wish I was somebody else, I wish I was never born, I wish I would‚Äôve ended it sooner, I wish I could just disappear peacefully. I don‚Äôt want to die but I also can‚Äôt stand this feeling anymore. I‚Äôm exhausted, I don‚Äôt have a job anymore, I‚Äôm back with my parents, I‚Äôm a failure, my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù only talk to me if I reach out first. I have absolutely nothing going for me, I‚Äôm so scared of everything. I fucking hate myself so much. What am I doing here? I haven‚Äôt left my room in 5 days, no one has checked up on me yet they want me to continue on living? Wtf. I can‚Äôt do anymore, I have no motivation, I‚Äôm tired. I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll make it to 30."
"I'm constantly thinking of this and that all the time, i think so much that i sometimes what to beat my head on the fucking wall, to escape from this i use my phone but after few hours i get tired of it too, since i dont use any social media and you can only watch youtube and other stuff so much, idk what else i can do? In times like these i just don't want to exist, everything fucking sucks..."
"What do I do in life if I don't even want to live life. I'm just existing basically because it's a sin to end it all in my religion.
I'm giftless and I was born with no luck in the world: cursed with an ugly appearance all because of how huge my nose is and a big belly button(probably a hernia) and there's nothing I can do about it until I turn 18 which is in 4 years and that's so long, I'm also not intelligent at all and I'll forever be envious of the smart people in my school that get As in their test effortlessly, and I'm autistic and really awkward with probably some other illness that contain psychosis but I can't get it treated because my parents are extremely religious and this illness is eating me inside and outside. 
I don't know how long I'll cope with this. In 2 years time I can finally wear makeup but I've been longing to wear it now because I'm tired of walking around with a hideous face and being constantly ridiculed and laughed at by of it in school. I don't know what I did to deserve this life because I'm really kind and I show compassion towards people who live lives harder than me by donating to charity and I respect my classmates and teachers and never retaliate whenever someone makes fun of my nose. In definitely cursed because I've got nothing.

Why couldn't I just have the life I've always wanted without any distractions instead of seeing my classmates casually walk around with the life IVE ALWAYS WANTED. 

I have no motivation or reason to continue existing but whats worse is that I can't just you know due to like I said my religion. I know I'm not going to be successful in the future so what's the point of all of this? "
"I've been struggling with my mental health for a while now. From the outside you would never tell but my eyes are such giveaway. I was never expressive person, I had resting bitch face my whole life. But recently I took pictures with my mom and I was smiling but I looked at my eyes and they did not match the smile on my face. They were empty, dead and without a spark, this is actually first time I noticed it. Its crazy how eyes are truly a mirror to someone soul "
"I‚Äôd like to get some insights and advice from people who‚Äôve been struggling with depression for the majority of their lives. How do you take that first step into the dating world without feeling like you have to hide it so that the other person won‚Äôt leave you once they see you for who you really are? I imagine having a strong circle of friends and family helps but unfortunately not everyone has that. Also it feels like modern dating is all about looking for a reason to eliminate someone based on their perceived shortcomings, and I find dating as a man is already difficult enough as it is without having a mental illness. I‚Äôm at a loss here and I can‚Äôt shake this impending sense of doom. Anything will help. I feel stuck and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the world anymore. "
"I'm sick of people saying ""it will get better"". When in fact, it's the opposite for me. It will get WORSE. So much worse. I just find new ways to be depressed really."
"So my little brother has always been a bit of a hot head and has always had the most absurd views for years but I am aware of the fact he has some sympathy due to his understanding of my sensitivity to my ADHD and he doesn't poke the bear and question if it's real or not. The doctor said so, so he believes it.  


But recently, I had a debate with him about Depression and he stated it was a state of mind. After his explanation, I asked if he was hearing this from himself or other people online who call themselves ""Alphas"". He then proudly told me how they don't call themselves Alphas cause they are and how it's from them. He told me how no one can be depressed but are just lazy and believe they can't do anything and how they should just ""Get over it""  


This hurt a lot since I have a lot of friends who struggle with depression, including my boyfriend who has vented to me about his mental state and to hear my little brother say these things made me want to cry and punch him in the face for saying such nonsense. I'm a very empathetic person and Empathize with the pain someone feels when struggling with depression so this felt as though he was attacking me as well.  


It hurt even more when he brought up our cousin's sui\*ide attempt due to depression saying she was in the wrong state of mind and it would've been better if she wasn't such a lazy person. I actually couldn't speak to him and didn't understand why he thought this way and idk if it's cause he's 12 since that's the excuse everyone is giving for this behavior. What do I do in this situation?"
"Like how? It‚Äôs hard to push through. No matter what I do or have, regardless if my upbringing is good or bad, or if my life is successful or not. I‚Äôll always be depressed. The word suicide bounces around my head like a tennis ball. I seriously need to get a hold of a doctor sooner than February for SSRI prescription, otherwise I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm gonna last that long."
"You ever feel like you're just not meant to be happy? That you were not meant for this life? That no matter how much you try, you only find yourself drowning in the depths of despair.

I can't remember the last time I truly felt joy. Well, I do, but it's been so long, it feels like a lifetime ago. And I don't know if I ever will again. Existing feels exhausting. For years, I've merely been existing, but I never truly feel alive. The days are mostly just dissociative episodes, but lately I've been feeling the weight of it all. I just want it all to stop. I truly do wish that I was never born. 31 years of consciousness, and most of that has been nothing but misery.

Why do some of us have to live with so much pain while some get to live a relatively good life? I can't even catch a break, it just constantly gets worse. I don't know if I have much strength left in me anymore, I can't keep living like this, this is no way to live"
"34 here and I don't really have friends anymore, I have acquaintances. Don't get to spend time with anyone because everyone is too ""busy"", which makes me wonder if I'm just lazy since I have free time, people I know make time for people of same ""social class"" as them, I feel like an unwanted peasant. I don't know how to make friends anymore, I haven't done enough interesting things or had enough similar life experiences to have conversations. People say being unique is a good thing, but right it makes me feel so lonely and sad."
"it‚Äôs strange, but i feel like a different person to who i was before all this. my memory is all foggy when i try to recall how i used to think, if that makes any sense. i miss me from before all of this. i don‚Äôt know if anyone else feels a similar way, but i feel like i‚Äôve wasted so much of my life feeling this way, and even when i try new activities and whatnot i just feel so disconnected to it all, even when i‚Äôm with people i‚Äôm closest with.

i recently came to a realisation the other day that i can‚Äôt move forward with my life until i get better or don‚Äôt have a life at all. it scares me. i feel like i‚Äôm rotting away every day."
"I‚Äôm 25 year old female. I have no qualifications, no job (for the last 3/4 years) no friends ( I literally mean no friends, I speak to my sister that‚Äôs about it). I cross face everyday (smoke weed and drink at the same time). I cry everyday in my room alone. The loneliness is so bad I actually speak to myself like fully have conversations with myself inside and out the house. I‚Äôve severed most of my close relationships during the early days of my addiction. My teeth are rotting away which has really affect my self asteem. Despite how much I try I can‚Äôt go longer than a month without vices. My parents hate me. I can‚Äôt do anything by myself. I spent so much on my addiction that I‚Äôm using a blocked phone and can‚Äôt even receive phone calls. I don‚Äôt want pity, I just want advice because I‚Äôm scared of death and what awaits me and I really want a positive outlook on life but how can I with the life I live?"

"I simply don't have the energy for anything nowadays. Going anywhere feels exhausting, and almost every time I do, I just wanna go home, lay in my bed and wallow in my misery in peace.

When I was three, my parents died. I have no grandparents, or aunts and uncles. 


Then, in 2020, on Thanksgiving Day, my twin sister unfortunately took her own life. 

In December 2020, my older brother died of a seizure. He hit his head and he was gone. 

In 2023, my oldest brother couldn't take it anymore and he unfortunately took his own life. 

And I've had multiple exes cheat on me and leave me because ""I wasn't good enough"".

I have an amazing and almost perfect fianc√© now, but I feel so damn lost and I don't know what to do.

"34M


I've had this thought before, but recently its been popping into my head more often.


I think about suicides that I've read or heard about, and how it's almost always about a teenager or young adult (20s maybe).
And people mention how tragic their death was (which is true) but also how someone ""died so young"" or ""were gone before their time.""


And it made me realize that I rarely hear about older people committing suicide. 
30s? maybe sometimes.
40s? Not often at all.
50s? 60s? Older? Almost never.


This makes me think there are only 2 possibilities. Either A. People get happier...or at least less depressed as they age. Which I find unlikely...

Or B.
The older you get, the less people care if you take yourself out. Which seems more likely.


Is it because young people still have so much potential? I suppose I would agree...
And if the biggest weights on my mind is how much time I've wasted and failed to do anything with.
How it's too late for me to really do anything of use or become what I want.
Older to me means I've just made more mistakes.


But anyways, I'm rambling.
I feel like if I had died when I was a teen or even in my 20s...at least people might have something nice to say. There'd be some regret.
The older I get, the more and more I feel like even if I did commit suicide, most people wouldn't even be surprised or care.
It'd just be like ""Well, look at his life...I don't blame him. I'd have done the same if I has been in his shoes."""
"Im posting because im having a trainwreck of a mental health day yet again. I (25F) have been like this for at least 13 years now. There was about 1 year in between where I thought I was somehow cured and finally started feeling okay again, like before I was depressed and anxious and all that.

But then I had what I think was a huge panic attack in 2021 which left me a husk of my ""new normal"" self. This was possibly covid/long covid related but now I have no way of knowing for certain. Since that day I have been back to square one, maybe even worse off.

I don't feel anything meaningful, my internal monolog is gone for the most part or really wrong. I'm completely numb. I'm so cognitively fucked, moreso than before, that I failed uni and ended up not being able to finish my BSc degree. The day to day fatigue is unreal, I keep trying to exercise regularly because it's the magic pill for energy apparently but I don't always manage to stay consistent. I have my hobby that I ""know"" I still ""enjoy"" that I still go through the motions with.

I'm tired and starting to want to drop everything that's left but then it'll be even more of a nightmare to piece my life back together some day. I don't even  know if I'll be able to do that again. It feels like it took everything I had to get into university the first time around and to get to that point where I felt normal for that year or so. And that normalcy was only fleeting.

I am numb aside from jealousy and anger. I've been told my whole life that it's all in my head (no shit ¬ø) and that I need to change my mindset, get over it, just try harder. And I'm always seeing people who feel like THAT without even trying. They don't even know what it's like to not feel normal. I'm so fucking angry and jealous that it's them instead of me. I too want joy instead of the absence of feeling  and self hatred believe me. Especially after getting to feel normal. It's not for lack of trying.

I'm a terrible person for being angry and jealous ig. I wish it wasn't me for a change. If anger and jealousy are feelings they are the only feelings I still feel for real and it's over everything. Being in public is a nightmare. Even seeing happy successful people on social media is a nightmare. and my use is limited already for that reason. I am a ball of hate and anger and I don't want to be this way. Ofc I go through the appropriate motions externally. But really my brain is a cesspit, i'm so glad no one knows how I think.

I wish I didn't get my year of normal, it's like a cruel joke. Most days I regret not ending it all a decade ago when I might have had the balls to. I don't even want to be dead, I'm terrified of death. I wish I was experiencing life with a different brain, I really want to live but not like this.

Edit:

Thank you to all who responded ‚ù§Ô∏è I expected this post to not get much attention so I was too overwhelmed to come back for a few days haha. Its so sad that many others can related to this, I hope we can all find some peace and normalcy some day."
"Lately, I've been feeling extremely worthless, quite literally like shit. I'm unhappy, easily-agitated, extremely tearful and just overall tired. I have troubles concentrating and have had some panic attacks. But I also don't think I have troubles getting out of bed, going to uni and working hard. My performance at university is good but obviously, it used to be much better (I used to have a scholarship). I find it hard to focus but if I try really hard and I give it more time, I can do well. Usually, when I read about depression, depressed people have troubles functioning normally and doing simple tasks. Is it possible to be high functioning and depressed?"

"So last year I was in a relationship with a girl (her name was Eva) and she was simply the best. She would always ask me how my day was, we would talk all day, we would understand each other, etc. But one day idk why, but I think I lost interest for a short period of time. I know I should have said we should take a break but I never said that Ik I‚Äôm dumb. So I told her I wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship(Ik that‚Äôs rly rly dumb) and she said:""ok I understand why you wanna leave me, I promise i will wait for you to be ready and I will love you forever"". I just started crying for many hours. She even told me happy birthday on my birthday. She remembered the date. But every week, I think about her and I feel so bad. But I‚Äôm happy that she finally moved on and that she found someone else than me."
"I can't stand myself as a person. I feel like I'm completely emotionally dysfunctional. I can't connect to anyone anymore. I can't explain myself well enough for anyone to get me. I have no interests or passion. No hobbies that I actually care about. I'm physically ugly af. I'm not intelligent or funny or talented. 

I'm not unloved. People deeply care about me. I have good, supportive people in my life. I have a pretty solid career. I'm just fucking awful. It's all me. I don't deserve the space I take up in the world. I wish I could disappear and someone better could take my place. The who care about me deserve that too. 

I want to be better and I just feel so incredibly mediocre."
I mean in reality therapists don't give much of a fuck about you anyways. Sessions are short and expensive.  They may listen to your troubles and teach you coping skills but without a person that actually cares about you there's no way you can completely pull yourself out of it.
I don't fucking want to live anymore. all the advice didn't work for me. Im sick of this life
For the past year I‚Äôve been writing little notes in my head of what I might want to say to people before I die. Just small thoughts and sentences. Sometimes sincere and sometimes spiteful. About a month ago during a bad depressive episode I wrote my thoughts down. It was messy and illegible and I can‚Äôt even read it now. Just today I wrote an actual note. Several. Clearly written and addressed to different people. I seems like every time I spiral it gets just a little bit worse. This time I wrote a note. Maybe next time I‚Äôll give that note a purpose. 
"i‚Äôm turning 31 very soon and it‚Äôs really starting to sink in that my depression is almost of legal drinking age. 
when i try to explain to most people that it‚Äôs not just being sad sometimes, it doesn‚Äôt go away, talking doesn‚Äôt help much, etc, it‚Äôs always the same reactions: ‚Äúwell it‚Äôll go away‚Äù ‚Äúwhen X changes, then you‚Äôll feel better‚Äù ‚Äúyou just have to get through this bout‚Äù. how do you really explain to someone that you‚Äôve wanted to die every single day (sans not a single day) since i was 11 years old. it seems unfathomable for most people which leads me to believe i might be actually crazy. 
it is very strange to me that i don‚Äôt know anyone else in my personal life who seems to struggle as intensely as myself and with as many frequent suicidal thoughts. 
it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter what is happening in my life, where my career is headed, how many friends i think i have.. the sum of all the parts still seems to equal zero.

"I've been trying so hard lately to do better and become a better person, but I just can't anymore. My job is going to shit and I can't find anything else around my family's work schedule since I don't have a car and I rely on them for transportation so i can only work weekends since i have to babysit my little brother during the week while my family is at work.

 I've always wanted to travel and see a few of the national parks across the US and camp out under the stars during the summer so I'm gonna do that within the next few months, and then go deep into the forest and shoot myself once I run out of money. I don't know why I'm typing this out and maybe it's a cry for help, but I just wanted to get this out and maybe talk with someone for awhile before I go. 

I'm sure I could eventually find something else if something happens with my Job, but with the current job market and only being able to work weekends greatly limits me and I can't just sit around as a grown man again with no Job unable to continue bettering my situation and helping my family. If anyone can think of any recommendations for my situation, feel free to suggest them so I can weigh other options I may not realize while in this headspace."

"about a week ago i was playing video games with my friends and out of nowhere, one of them brought up an extremely embarrassing and traumatic experience of mine. 

in my freshman year of high school, i was badly jumped by 3 guys and i was made fun of for it all throughout my hs years, and its been so long (almost 10 years) since it happened that i don‚Äôt really think about it anymore, so when he said it, it really caught me off guard. all my emotions from the past and how people treated me, recorded me, laughed and made fun of me came back and it made me feel like pure shit, and i‚Äôve been more down than usual lately because of it. 

i have someone who‚Äôs supposed to be my friend randomly telling me how the day i got beat up was ‚Äúone of the funniest days in hs‚Äù but it was hell for me. i literally attempted suicide bc of all the stress and negative attention that i was getting, and i hated school so much that i would skip sometimes or just hide in different areas of the school all day like the bathroom or auditorium just to avoid being seen or having to deal with people. so much of my social development was stunted because of that shit.

 i haven‚Äôt talked to any of my friends since, but this isnt even the first time something like this has happened. im also the only one thats still a virgin and has never been on a date and that subject is also very embarrassing for me and has been randomly brought up during times when we‚Äôd be gaming. i know they talk shit about me behind my back and honestly i think its best to just part ways and let this friendship with all of them go, i already feel bad enough in my shitty life"

I do not even feel like I have any right to feel depressed let alone express it to other people as a male. The world seems to say, 'shut up, man up, carry on making money or cancel yourself'. There's nobody to talk to anyway, I must not be a real man if I'm depressed, suicidal and lonely and unable to power through it like normal men can- if they feel this way at all, and I've never been interested in money other than the fact that we are all required to worship and sacrifice at money's altar if we want a mate, a comfortable life and the ability to continue living if we get sick or hurt in any way.

He‚Äôs telling me he‚Äôs scared and exhausted and doesn‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I keep telling him I love him and need him and this too shall pass. 

Lexapro script is from PCP. 2 month wait to see a psychiatrist. ER will only help prevent imminent suicide, right? 

I just don‚Äôt know how to help him. I have give him my full support and blessing to take a few days off of work and hike or do whatever he needs to do. Unfortunately we can‚Äôt pay the bills if he takes an extended time off of work.

"**Update 2.5 months later.**  Things generally seemed to be going better.  My wife and/or I were visiting with him almost every weekend and he and I had a couple of long talks that really helped him.  He was getting more engaged with his social circle and had concrete future plans, including some cosmetic surgery to help with confidence.

Then yesterday I got a call from a hospital - fortunately not badly hurt.  He apparently has been cutting a lot and a cut on his leg was bad enough to need stitches.  He went to an urgent care which triggered a mental health evaluation and now he's in a multi-day hold (we're in the US).  We're hoping this will be for the best.  We visited him yesterday and he was glad to see us, if embarrassed, and we'll be part of his discharge plan tomorrow (my wife will be staying with him short term).  If this goes well he'll get started on an IOP with intensive therapy and possibly some medication to help.  

Honestly, I was worried that although he was in a generally good steady state the root causes were not being addressed, and hope this will motivate him to make the necessary changes.

**Update 19 hours later**.  Good news.  THANK YOU to everyone who responded and offered their experiences and suggestions.  It has really, really helped.  I have or will upvote all comments received and although I haven't responded to everyone I did read them all and give them a lot of thought.

So he said that it really helped to have his feelings validated.  That what he was experiencing was real and that others are going through the same thing.  I think when he's talked about this in the past there has been a tendency to respond with ""it's not as bad as you think"" or otherwise dismiss what he feels.  Once that happened the discussion became a lot more two way.

Secondly, the suggestions of an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) seem to have hit the mark.  We've found several near where he lives, and with his job and insurance it should be no problem getting in.  We like this idea better than trying another therapist as it doesn't rely on a single patient-therapist relationship but instead there are a lot of tools the IOP can use to help people.

Any suggestions for how to help him find the best IOP for him are most welcome!

He's not ready to start any medicines just yet, but it's possible that may be one of the tools used in the IOP.

He's also started to make plans beyond next month - for example to attend an out of state event with external family.  To me that's huge.  And he's reversed the steps he took to prepare for ending his life in two weeks.

Once again, many thanks to the responders on this post!

**Original Post**.

See my profile for previous post.  Today he visited us at home and after discussion admitted that he had a specific plan to end his life on a specific day in a few weeks.  He was taking actions to make it easier on us.   He agreed that he won't do it at least through February, as he saw our (my wife and I) emotional reaction.

We're struggling to find any way to help him out of his depression and hoping someone can offer a suggestion that he'll respond to.   He feels that the depression is not from within himself but due to external factors he can't control.  Despite his success at work and the fact that people like and respect him - he's extremely polite and inoffensive - he struggles socially and feels people think negative thoughts about him, and he can cite some examples where people said ""all XXX are blah blah blah"" to support that.  He's tried therapy and has stopped that as he feels he has gotten as much as he can out of that.

I'm wondering if there might be some sort of Life Coach who specializes in social skills for male 20s people in STEM careers who have similar feelings.   But I'm sure most of the people who call themselves ""Life Coach"" wouldn't work for him.

I again suggested medication for depression as a temporary measure because he thinks the problem is external.  However, we have years of experience with someone very close to us who had similar thoughts, but when put on medication it reduced the depths of her depression and that gave her enough confidence and traction to resolve her chronic depression and eventually discontinue with the medication.  I think I may ask him to try it anyway just in case.

Suggestions welcome.  I think we may have only bought a bit more time."

"I am a cis woman and I was dating a cisman at that time. After I survived I was home for several days, leaving only to go meet my psychiatrist. After a couple of weeks I decided to go to a small event near our home where people were selling small handmade goodies. I figured it was a low stake engagement with the outside world that would cheer me up. I went there with my then boyfriend and we got back home after 15 mins of being there. I bought a couple of candles and a some hair and skin masks from a very sweet young woman.

When we got back home my boyfriend told me he was embarrassed that I had not shaved my face and that as it is he is on the edge because of of my attempt and that he doesn't need the additional attention on him because he is accompanying a woman with facial hair. I was 29 at this point and have had really dark and thick facial hair all my life. When I was 16 yes old I got laser treatment for hair removal and it helped reduce the growth. I have always been very self conscious about my facial hair and in some ways I was enjoying not giving a crap about these superficial things since I was feeling better in days. 

At that point I felt bad for him, apologised and told him I'll be more mindful about my grooming habits. But now, years later, I wish I could go back to my younger self, give her a hug and tell her that her way of experiencing and expressing joy is valid. "

I have had no friends since highschcool and even in highschool I barely talked to the friends I had. In primary school my only friend used to bully me sometimes. I fucking hate everyone. I have been in college for 2 years now and I still have no friends. I also have bad back pain a lot of the time due to scoliosis. I have also had teeth pain and other forms of pain in the past. I'm sick and tired of suffering. I just want to end it all. I think the only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my parents.
"It feels pointless because no one will ever see my art or appreciate them and I just wonder why try doing hobbies when I should just stay in bed and do nothing
Edit: Holy crap you guys are awesome! Thank you guys for the advice and words of encouragement! I might get back to creating art again thank you!"
"People know I‚Äôm depressed. I drop the odd joke here and there about how bad it is. I‚Äôve talked seriously to a few people about it. But either no-one cares, or no-ones taking me seriously (which ironically is part of the fuel)

But everyday I hate my life. I only exist for other people. I have lost who I am, and the worst part is I know it. Im trapped in this endless routine of ‚Äòjust get to the weekend‚Äô and I then spend the weekend trying to catch up on other work, or sleep.

I can‚Äôt enjoy myself. I‚Äôm not even sure I remember how. I go to bed every night just praying that if I have to wake up, it‚Äôs in a few weeks time in a hospital and I‚Äôve been in some sort of coma. Just anything that takes me out of this and let‚Äôs me hit some sort of reset.

I hate my job so much. The workplace is toxic, the work is soul destroying. It‚Äôs mind-numbing.  But I don‚Äôt know how to quit. I have responsibilities like every one else. I need the job. 

Where did all the time go. Why am I getting old and slower. Why am I gaining so much weight no matter how much I work out. I feel like I‚Äôve aged about 15 years in the last 3-5 years. I look tired and I hate it. But nothing I do helps. 

I‚Äôm an eternal optimist, but the intrusive thoughts are starting to win.

How on earth do you get out of these pits without completely destroying your life?"
"I hate that so many people ""love the holidays because it brings families together"" but me ever since 15 I‚Äôve hated it to much trauma happen on Christmas that I will have to live with for the rest of my fucking life. Every year I spend in tears from late October to the end of January I dread I dont even try to feel better around this time of year the cold weather doesn‚Äôt help at all just makes me more depressed can‚Äôt seem to keep my soul off the ground it so hard to look up and make eye contact I will never be happy I see others happy and I kind of envy it and tell myself I wish I had the drive and motivation that these people have yet I‚Äôm just a outcast I‚Äôm insanely different in this normal world and it pains me and don‚Äôt fit in I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm hurt in a way know one will ever know even if I won the lottery I would still be depressed it just the way it is there no cure I wish there‚Äôs a vaccine needle I could just shoot up and I will give me energy
And happiness as y‚Äôall know tomorrow is thanksgiving and I won‚Äôt be celebrating to protect my heart and I won‚Äôt be celebrating Christmas this year holidays are overrated it makes me sick what I see also, is there anyone else that feels the same about the holiday season late October - January because to me it‚Äôs the worst part of the year"
"I just hate myself tonight.

Edit: thank you all who responded. I had a bad night but I know I always feel better with time. Keep on keeping on üí™"
I am a disappointment and a really bad person 
"My mother died two years ago. Before that I always thought that my mother was the only reason I was still alive. She was the only light in my life and I could not break her heart by commiting suicide. But I was always thinking if she were to leave us, I would do it. 

Now that I've experience the grief and pain of her departure, I've realized I can't do it. I can't make my family go through that again. I can't make my friends feel that pain. Some days I feel like giving up and ending it, but I can't think about it without remembering what it feels like to be grieving.

I hope that eventually I will find life worth living but until then I feel like I'm trapped and lost."
"I‚Äôve been miserable ever since I remember. I don‚Äôt think I have a will or reason to live, but when I think about death (not suicide), but like the state of being absent/to stop existing, I get this awful feeling in my gut ? Why could this be happening ?"
"Sorry if this doesn‚Äôt make any sense, I‚Äôll try to write it out.

For the last couple of days I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about killing myself. I don‚Äôt think I will because I know deep down that all my depressive episodes will end eventually, but this time the thoughts just won‚Äôt leave me alone. I went on a walk to try and clear my head but instead I ended up at a local bridge, staring off of the edge. It‚Äôs so strange because I have a ‚Äúplan‚Äù I suppose - I‚Äôve been researching the tallest places in my area - but I know I won‚Äôt follow through with it. It‚Äôs sort of passive and sort of active. 

I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going with this. Do I need help? I suppose that‚Äôs my main question. And does anyone else relate?? "
"Long story short, I‚Äôm planning on committing suicide this week. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone, no one seems to understand how I feel. Some kind words from anyone would be nice. Please, I‚Äôm at a loss. I need some comforting.
"
"I deeply feel there was a sense of change when the pandemic hit in 2019-2020. It seems like humanity became more destructive, with kindness and friendliness becoming rare. Meeting new people now often comes with the fear of betrayal or backstabbing. This shift has changed my perspective on life, leaving me feeling alone and sometimes depressed because I have no one to share life with. Does anyone else feel lonely in this world today?"
"The person I thought I was going to marry gave up on me five years ago and I haven‚Äôt been the same since. I‚Äôm angry all the time, I don‚Äôt want to be around anybody, and I don‚Äôt enjoy life, even currently with the best salary I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôm such a god damn letdown. 

The great thing is that I did everything I could to get past this depression (therapy, talking it out with friends, move to a new city, tried new hobbies, etc.) 

So, if I ever am fortunate enough to leave this earth peacefully, at least the people who love me will have no regrets about if they could‚Äôve done anything more to help.

There‚Äôs nothing else anybody could‚Äôve done. At least they will have that closure.

‚Äî

TL;DR ‚Äî I had my heart broken in 2019, haven‚Äôt fully recovered, and am tired of trying."
"I hate being an ugly woman. It has to be one of the worst things to happen to a person. I have no career ambitions or prospects, and no romantic prospects. I just want to be loved, held, cherished. I want to feel normal. I want to be able to travel and take pictures and feel happy. I am so fucking ugly it's like I'm not even human. I'm not even sure plastic surgery could help me. I wish I looked like all those other girls. Then I'd have something to live for."
"I just wish I could go back to being a kid again. Playing games like Minecraft and not having a single care in the world that tomorrow I might not have money to buy food. 

I can't deal with this adult crap anymore. I just want to go back to being a kid. Go back to being in school. 

Sometimes I wish I failed school on purpose so that I could get a summer vacation. Now, with my job, even if it's not very tiring at all (SysAdmin), u get so exhausted I want to have a long vacation. 2-3 months at least..

But that's not possible because I'd be out of a job if I did that. 

I just want to have more free time to work on myself rather than to just sit around wanting to die because I can't go through another day of ""nostalgia"" for the past. 

I don't want to go to school with the same class because I was bullied to hell and back but I want to have what High School students have...

Freedom. Yes, they're not independent and rely on someone else, but I'd much rather that than to be stuck in an endless cycle of waking up, going to work, coming back home tired and sleeping after texting my girlfriend for a while...

I dunno, just felt like venting here, I suppose. 

Sorry for the long post and for the soppy story..."
"If there is something that we have anywhere in our country is Alcohol.

Is Alcohol good? Can it make you feel better?"
"Does anyone else yearn for some sort of human contact, specifically touch like I just want to be doing my normal things like drawing, watching shows, reading and web surfing but with someone like just chilling w our legs intertwined? Quietly, for the most part, but maybe showing each other something funny some times or small kisses. No pressure to be social or put on a mask. Just... me, with someone. And maybe sometimes we could go out together and do things but mostly just... exist, with someone else. That's all I want."
Just now. It didn't work. I tried twice but I didn't tie it tight enough and as soon as I couldn't breath and started to struggle it came undone. I think I could do it right if I try again. But I'm scared to. I'm a fucking coward. I'm going to take a shower. Idk I just needed to tell someone because I'll probably never bring this up to anyone ever again
"I really hate this line, there is no point of saying this if i was about to kms, what you want me think? ""Oh ok now I won't be sad because you can see the future"" ofc not, you know nothing about me and you dare to say to me that everything will become happy because yes? C'mon, if you don't know how to understand my feelings, is better keep your mouth shut instead of saying nonsense."
"It can be mild, moderate, or severe. I can think about just quietly dying in my sleep from an OD or something, or really, really graphic stuff like self-mutilation.

Today has been one of those days where it is just obsessive and I just can't stop thinking about it.

Sometimes it feels so overwhelming that I just want everything to stop; others it feels so underwhelming that I don't see the point in a numb existence. I go from such deep sadness and hurt and emotional agony to a complete vacuum of feeling where I actually feel incapable of feeling pleasure.

I've tried everything that people recommend: positive mental health routines, exercise, diet, hobbies, spirtuality, community, counseling, cbt, psychotherapy, medication, psychiatry. All I really got out of it was a diagnosis of a mood disorder and cptsd, which gave me absolutely no closure and just made me feel more dysfunctional. All this shit about men needing to speak out and say what they need / how they feel - I've done it, and it's just made me feel worse.

I've tried everything that people don't recommend: alcohol, drugs, promiscuity, porn, idfk.These things make me feel equally as empty, understandably.

It doesn't matter what's going on in my life either. I have friends, I have had romantic relationships, I have repaired relationships in my family, I have a good job, I have accomplishments - none of it helps.

I don't feel like I can confide this in anyone without them just freaking out, or them just not really knowing what to say. I also don't really believe I'm that important to anyone. Not in a degrading or low self-esteem way, just in the way of I'm confident that people would be fine without me and that's okay.

I've been through different thoughts / feelings of my suicidality. I've been really enthused by it, I've been incredibly sad about it, really scared about it, to now just being tired.I'm so tired. I really don't want to live a life where I just feel like this until I'm eventually dead.

I don't even have anything to really be sad about anymore. I haven't lost anything in ages. No grief of lost loved ones or relationships. I'm just suicidal for the sake of being suicidal.

I just hate this. I hate feeling like a pathetic victim all the time. I'm not. I'm not brave. I'm not strong. It's just sad and stupid and I really just want it to stop.

idk, I think I've lost hope and I think I'll inevitably give in.

j, 26

***Edit 21/11/23:***  
Just wanted to respond wholely to a few people all at once and clear a few things up.

  
I posted this post in both r/SuicideWatch and r/depression \- I didn't really know where it lived, and I am really not used to reddit. I actually think this is the first time I've posted anything. I will say, it is absolutely hilarious that you get a notification saying ""Wow, 50 upvotes!"" about your suicidal ideation.

  
I am not diagnosed with BP I /BP II. My formal diagnosis is recurrent major depression. I took celexa (citalopram) for a few years and abilify (aripiprazole) for a year or so. I tried lamictal (lamotrigine) too but the psychiatrist was concerned about side effects. I am currently unmedicated. I don't know if I experience mania or not, but feel that if I did I would be probably be aware of it.

  
The CPTSD is, from what I understand, to do with having a weird childhood. I don't think it was particularly bad compared to others who have ptsd/cptsd. My parents divorced, mum hit dad, both alcoholics, mum seems to have some naricistic personality traits and was unpleasant to me and my sibling, was questionably homeless for a few months, idk; had an abusive partner who told me that she was going to kill herself pretty much everyday bc I didn't love her enough. I know none of it is good, but it seems so mild compared to other people I know who have suicidal thoughts that I know. I'm also really disconnected from it all most of the time, and it doesn't even really feel like it happened.

  
My relationship with drugs and alcohol aren't great. I am trying to cut down my alcohol intake but often find that if I have one, I'll have too many. Cocaine is a goto as well, but I feel I've largely cut this out. When things get a lot I would happily take Xanax again, but I always fear that I'll get really addicted and then I'll be really fucked.

  
I have no current timeline on ending my life and I know what help is available here in the UK if I enter crisis.

  
I don't really know why I posted this tbh - I guess as I said above, I've tried everything else? Maybe I was hopefull that there would be a miracle person who had some crazy snake oil that would be my answer to being content. ""Hey man, have you tried ketamine therapy? It actually worked for me!"" Some crazy fantasy.

  
Thank you to those who have spoken out. It's both comfortable and uncomfortable to know that others feel similar. I very much wish you didn't, but I'll shut up and hold the community hands reaching out.

  
Thank you for all giving a damn, j"
So.. I'm fucked up and depressed but somehow managed to land an interview for a job on my second job application. I desperately need a job. I know it's fake it until you make it but I would really like some words of encouragement. Has anyone gone through getting a job when they weren't at their best? I really need some encouragement.
I've been like this for the past 5-7 years. I just wondered has anyone improved? Did anyone actually get friends? Did anyone get a girlfriend/boyfriend? Maybe a job... Did anyone gain a...life? If yes please tell me how. For I'm not living and I'm about to end it all. 
"I'm 23 and i have no desire to live  and can't remember of a time when i did.I hate everything and everyone.I fantasize about blowing my brains out all day and just the thought of it is comforting, unfortunately i do not have a gun and I'm too much of a coward to do it another way. I'm fed up of waking up, I'm fed up of going to work , I'm fed up of seeing all the same stupid faces everyday and wish death upon them. I'm fed up of going home from work , I'm fed up of having to shower , brushing my teath , going to the bathroom, having to eat , having to drink , I'm fed up of having to sleep.Nothing brings me joy and my face has no emotions.Nothing interests me in life,  the only ""hobby"" i have is making music and i barely have the motivation to do so, my free time off work cosists of me laying back on my chair listening to music and staring at the ceiling for hours.
I go to a therapist every week and take antidepressants , the only reason i do so is so my mother would shut up , i don't expect it to work.
Everyone says "" you'll find a reason to live "" i really don't think that's the case and even if i do "" find it "" it doesn't fix anything , i want nothingness, pure nothingness, to have never existed.

I'm sorry if this is hard to read , I'm bad at writing stuff and even worse at expressing myself"
I‚Äôm a gay male and scared to come out I‚Äôve been gay for the last around 5 years I see no escape from this and I just wanna blow my head off
So many living things are suffering right now and have been since the beginning of life and will continue to do so until everything is extinct and it depresses me why is this world such a sick cruel place why is literally everyone and everything suffering in some form I wish something could be done it actually hurts me knowing about the horrors going on in this world as well as the horrors that no one knows about it's sickening and it's already a very painful night for many of us but if there's one thing I could wish for it is for all forms of suffering to end for everyone and everything no matter how they're suffering it's just got to stop and it's so painful knowing that unimaginable suffering has been happening for so long and will continue to happen I honestly wish all life forms didn't have to be born and were extinct for one reason to prevent them from suffering its actually disgusting how those in positions of power know about all this suffering but choose to do nothing because they only care for themselves why can't we have kind compassionate people in power i know not everyone agrees with voluntary extinction but its the only way to ensure suffering can never happen again all i want is the ability to prevent suffering that's all i wish i could do something about this I physically can't take the way this world is please just end the suffering for all
"I have never been extremely sad either or suicidal. But most mornings I wake up feeling sad and lonely as if my life has no purpose. I'm 42f. I'm single.  I have a dog.  Moved around a lot my whole life. I have friends, but no best friends. Have been in my current city for 5 years and most friends are from sport or work.  I'm overall content but I do feel sad and lonely a lot for no real reason.

I exercise. I eat healthy.  I'm happy when around friends but I'm also an introvert. It feels like the older I get the harder it is to be alone. Eg now around Xmas when everyone is around family and I'm alone in a different country. I had some invites but afterwards I feel even lonelier.

I can't remember if I ever was really happy. I did one year of travel in 2004 with 2 friends when I probably was genuinely happy. But besides that I can't think of times when I was happy. 

Besides that I had a work incident about 5 years ago that left me with PTSD. And this year in a new job, a new toxic boss triggered that. So I'm sad now thinking about that. Plus I'm now also dealing with huge anxiety in the workplace due to toxic boss.   


I've always been independent, adventurous, strong. Friends describe me as aloof. But also funny (sarcasm) and smart and caring. I've always enjoyed my own company. I've had relationships with great men. I used to love being on my own.  

But I'm wondering maybe I've always been depressed. I've never taken medication, but maybe I should? I feel like I should be happier."
"My depression sucks because I feel like it could easily be cured by having someone. ANYONE. I don‚Äôt have any friends who live nearby and I haven‚Äôt dated anyone in years. I don‚Äôt get the point of this monotonous, lonely, and sad life. How do you find meaning when all you have is you?"
"Today I went to a psychiatric appointment and had a talk with my doctor, it ended up getting a little deep and we ended the session off on a good note. However I had a dentist appointment about an hour or so after and when the lady was reaching around me to grab something behind me she connected both arms around me. It felt like one of those half assed hugs you were forced to give as a kid when you had to makeup with someone. A few tears started coming down and I almost broke down. It's been so long since I've had a hug from someone, let alone feel the touch of a woman. I feel so alone and pathetic."
"Every waking moment of my life makes me fully believe that I am trapped in an endless cycle of suffering that I cannot escape from. About six years ago when I first started to feel depressed, I always thought to myself that eventually things would turn out to be fine. But, everything has been a downfall since. I have no friends, girlfriend, ambition, and job. I feel just pathetic and lonely each single day, questioning what is the purpose of all this suffering. In addition, my health has greatly been deteriorating after I got diagnosed with a thyroid condition 2 years ago. I‚Äôve gained significant weight and have been losing so much hair since. I have become so insecure of myself that I cannot even look at myself in the mirror. I just want to be loved and be happy."
"(Posted on r/suicidewatch as well)

 I fully understand that in the context of biology it is irrational. I‚Äôm talking about wether it can be a rational reaction to a hopeless situation. People call it a ‚Äúpermanent solution to a temporary problem‚Äù but for some it‚Äôs NOT temporary.
There is no cure for the illnesses that I suffer from every day. Treatments are either laughably inadequate or prohibitively expensive. Since I lack the resources for proper treatment, recovery is impossible. I am hopelessly trapped in this situation and would much rather die soon than stay and suffer for another 40-50 years.
Why is use of euthanasia acceptable in cases of an incurable/terminal physical illness, which severely impacts quality of life, but not when it‚Äôs a mental illness that severely impacts quality of life? My quality of life is most definitely impacted. At what point does asking someone like me to continue become cruel? I am acutely aware that I am extremely biased but I genuinely believe that it‚Äôs an appropriate course of action in this case. I‚Äôm literally only holding on for the sake of sparing peoples feelings but why are their feelings more important than mine? Why am I the selfish one for considering this? Can anyone offer an explanation of why I should keep going when there‚Äôs practically no chance of things getting better?"
"I am tired of this. I am tired of being antsy..what‚Äôs the point of life if it has to be this way? Everyone in my home is asleep, even the dog is snoring yet here I am up at 2:50 AM full of anxiety and deep into thoughts of regret and overthinking üòì

For more context: I am 29 year old person who deeply regrets her decisions and how overthinking has even messed up my life and I feel life of others.

Update: thank you so much everyone ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. It seriously warms my heart..I am still very hurt but feel better knowing there are people who relate and appreciate all the advice too ü´∂üèΩ"
"I (26F) have been suffering depression for 15 years and 6 years of hypomania (that I know of). Ever since I was 11 years old, I‚Äôve wanted to die because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere. Well, now, I‚Äôm 26. Still living with mom. Graduated with my degree in English but working a cannabis store that doesn‚Äôt pay me a livable wage. My boss doesn‚Äôt know how to manage and used to bully me. $10k in credit card debt and $20k+ in student loan debt. My only friends are my friends from work. Sexual trauma that is always being replayed in my head. 

My mom and I the last few months have been having a very tough time trying to live together and talk to each other. She divorced my dad end of the summer last year, which was very much needed. My dad is a drunk and close to being an alcoholic. he had a major stroke in 2018 so the blood thinners make him 10x more drunk than he is. When he drinks, he‚Äôs verbally abuse to not only my mom, but me. When it comes to living with my mom, we live differently, but I wish I lived like her. What I mean is that I wish I could keep my room clean. I wish I could do the dishes at an appropriate time. I wish I did my laundry every week. I wish I was on top of it with money and appointments, but I‚Äôm not. She hates that. 

Since I‚Äôve admitted to her, my therapist, and my psychiatrist that I am in a depressive state, my mom wants me to cut my bad habits out cold turkey. My therapist and I have noticed that doing too many things at once so quickly does not work for me. My sister understands that I need to do it slowly and she‚Äôs the most supportive and understanding one in my family about my depression. 

Sunday night (Mother‚Äôs Day), my mom came home from work pissed off. I listened to her rant about work and I told her what I thought about it, but didn‚Äôt give advice because I know she didn‚Äôt want that. After dinner, I asked her if I could do the dishes before we started another episode of our show because I knew she had to go to bed soon since she worked early early the next day. I knew if I did the dishes immediately after dinner she‚Äôd be happy that I didn‚Äôt wait till the last second. She snapped and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre either going to sit down and watch this with me or you‚Äôre going to your room and I‚Äôm watching it myself.‚Äù I cried the rest of the night and put myself to sleep by crying. Before sleeping, I was really thinking of just getting up and going to the over pass and jumping off and into the highway. We‚Äôve been fighting once or twice a week when we used to fight once every two months. I just can‚Äôt make her happy. 

With my job, my money situation, and my relationship with my parents, I just want to fucking not be here anymore. I want to be put out of my misery. I lost three friends two weeks ago because they never understood my mental health or my trauma and treated me like shit. I just want this pain to go away. I just want to be free and happy. I don‚Äôt know when the last time I was able to be happy for a week. The last time I remember being happy for a full week was before I was 10.

My brain is just a big thunderstorm, tornado, Nor‚Äôeaster combined in one. It‚Äôs never ending and it never takes a break. I wish I lived somewhere where i go do an assisted suicide.

"I just really miss being a kid. I miss when I didn‚Äôt have to doubt who loved me, or hate the way I look. I miss when I was just person treated with love and care and could just be happy. Now that I‚Äôm growing up I just really want to turn into a kid again and forget this part of my life. It‚Äôs not even just responsibilities, I just want to feel as happy as I was as a little kid before I realized how much nothing I have and how little my life actually means. 


I want my old friends back, I want what my parents used to mean to me back. I just want to feel like everything‚Äôs gonna be okay and I don‚Äôt have to carry  every bit of pain around with me anymore. "
"I'm 15. I made my first attempt when I was only 9.   
My entire life was a fucking joke. I was abused mentally by my mother and physically by my stepfather. I was bullied in school and never taken seriously when I talked about my problems. I was always the weird outsider. 
  
I'm autistic, have ADHD and depression.  
It's horrible living like this. I feel absolutely nothing. 
  
The only thing I have are my thoughts. And they're terrifying. I have no words to express the hatred I have for myself and for this world.  
  
There's nothing that makes me happy. I just wanna die. I tried everything. I took meds, talked with countless therapists, went to the psych ward, tried to find ways to cope, none of it worked.  
  
All I ever wanted was peace. I've spent all my time trying to distract myself with books, video games, music, art and so on.  
  
I realized that I was really passionate about music, but even that couldn't help me in the long run.  
  
I've spent the whole last year just drinking and getting high. I feel amazing, but this isn't life. There's no point in staying alive If you spend all of it desperately trying to numb yourself.  
  
I don't even want to be happy anymore. Every time I do manage to feel good, I just end up slitting my wrist because the feeling is so unreal. I can't really explain it.  
  
  
I don't fucking know anymore. I just want it to stop.  I can't do this.  
  
God, why? "
"Anybody else feel like you‚Äôre just at a dead end? Or you feel the repetitiveness of waking up everyday for work and coming home tired not having energy for people or to do anything? Or those habits that you know are wrong but you keep doing it..? That‚Äôs me right now. I‚Äôm not looking for people to feel bad for me. Just people to relate to I guess. 

-Take care, Reddit family."
"I‚Äôm 30 years old, I was diagnosed when I was an early teen. Over half my life I‚Äôve struggled with depression, anxiety, self harm and suicidal thoughts. Will things ever actually get better I wonder? Life is just so exhausting. "
She finally said it. Finally mom would be sad is no longer a reason anymore. Things has finally come to this. Now I feel kinda free. 
Last year my 2 year old Son was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma after 8 months of battle he has passed last September. Since then I feel like Ive got nothing to live for and whenever I try to reach out to my wife and family they just get mad and thinks it all just for pity or attention. Theyll never understand us who is battling our own demons every single day is a struggle for us.
It‚Äôs all becoming redundant and unbearable
I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be depressed if I didn‚Äôt have to make myself meals every day. Me not eating is definitely the reason I can‚Äôt get out of bed everyday.
"Maybe this is peak gen-x 'meh', but seriously I just can't be bothered fighting anymore. From my failed marriage, to my difficult ND kids, to my sometimes rewarding but mostly soul crushing job, to my aging broke parents that I am going to have to look after. I have no one because I just can't be fucked with people.

I'm broken, tired and waiting for something to take me out. What a blessing that would be.

How are happy people happy? Where does their energy come from? I don't get it at all - and I've tried so much to get it, I've tried with professionals, spouses, friends and family. But I just dont.

I'm ok, not suicidal, just done. Tired, broken and would totally welcome death's warm embrace should it choose to seek me out."
"hi 15m here, and i'm kinda scared for tomorrow. this is just a quick little rant, and I've thought about it for 4 months whether i should actually do it or not. It seems the answer is yes, but i'm still a little bit tingly about it.

I'm so left behind actually, and my parents are no help. I'd probably try to live a little longer if they did, but i don't think I'm gonna not be suicidal too. I don't like the concept of living in the first place, I don't want to be sick, immobile. I don't want to work to clear my addictions, I don't want to try hard to get a job, because seriously? who is dreaming about jobs üò≠

I have like 12 missing assignments and 4 absence in just a week, cause i thought that since I'm gonna die anyway, those times can be used for myself. Missing those assignments are like, me promising myself that I will die, so i can't just back off with my plan.

this might be a little niche too, but i'm just going to add that i'm going to try and shift for the last time. If it doesn't work, well, i'm gonna die miserably, but if it did, I'll stay just a little longer.

not replying btw, i'm just going to rant. see you guys never ily &lt;3"
"Im only a teenager, and im depressed. i am seriously thinking about s\*\*cide, because none of my parents, or friends acknowledged it. they just think its an excuse, or just a stupid fucking joke."
"I'm a 6'3 cis woman. I hate it. I was born a woman, but I'm just abnormally tall. I wish I could just trade heights with a short dude, then he'd get to be taller than most people and I'd get to be average. Both happy. I used to get harassed lots, especially because people assumed I was a cross dresser or trans. I'm comfortable being a woman, I just wish I wasn't TALL. I've tried doing all sorts of things to make myself shorter but it just won't work. I want to end it all. Not just that, but my mother is the biggest dick ever. 'Have children! Get married!' FUCK OFF. I'm 27 years old, I can choose. Plus, childbirth and pregnancy makes me feel SICK. I'M SCARED of it. She just won't understand though. Babies are cute, sure. But I'd rather adopt, NOT have my own child. And then she gets mad because I'm 'selfish' and don't want her to be a happy grandmother. I mean, she has two other children, and one of them had 4 kids!! Why do I have to bother if she's already got 4 damn grandkids?? Oh, and another piece of trauma to add to the mix, I was almost stabbed by a co-worker for not giving him a blow job?? (We were dating, it was during sex.) Like, what? I don't like having your dick in my mouth, thanks. Sometimes I don't understand how I'm still alive and functioning. And just one last thing, one of my students (he was 14, I'm a secondary school teacher) sent me a hand-written letter saying how much he had a crush on me. It was corny. I hate my life.

  
TLDR: I'm tall, I hate it. My mother sucks. I was almost stabbed. I hate kids. A student gave me a letter on how much he loves me. Ew."
"I fucking hate summer so much, it's so hot n gross and just over all dreadful. it doesn't help that my depression is so much more debilitating in the summer, I not sure why it just is, I sleep in much later and have a harder time getting our of bed, and just overall don't want to do anything, I just want to lay in bed and rot"

"I have a friend which I‚Äôve known for 4 years and I‚Äôve just learned that he was depressive and that he sometimes cuts himself. 

About his life: To be honest it‚Äôs pretty fucking miserable, he never takes anything seriously, he has the worst grades possible, he just goes to school to do nothing. I‚Äôm also concerned because he has the hobby to completely destroy the school toilet, I know this might seem funny but he literally made the school pay 300k ‚Ç¨ because he made a flooding in the school and the police are investigating. He also has a problem with porn (again might seem funny but I‚Äôm worried) he regularly sends extremely brutal pornography or people having sex with dead animals,he also has the problem that he doesn‚Äôt care abt his body att all, idk if he regularly drinks alcohol, but recently he emptied an entire bottle of some liquid (stuff to rinse your mouth) to drunk himself, he apparently puked 3-5 times.
Idk it might seem ridiculous to many people but 

I‚Äôm actually really worried abt his future and I wanted to ask, how can I know if he is suicidal?

"Delete if not appropriate, my apologies.

My (28m) partner (27f) just left me after five years and i can feel myself falling into a deep depression. I will spare the greater deatils but things have been so incredibly difficult for me the past two months and i feel completely traumatized. Nothing feels important. nothing feels worth it. And i am fighting back panic attacks 24/7. I have a lot of friends and a lot of distractions but it all feels so hollow without her in my life. I am not doing good at all. I have started seeing a therapist.

With all this going on i have somehow started masturbating way more than i ever have before. Multiple times a day, surpassing what was a normal amount before. Every time i do im just thinking about how much I miss being with her and longing for what I had just a few months prior. its a cycle of having my mind race, thinking about her, thinking about the physical times we had together, the times we could be having right now, missing those times, getting horny, masturbating, thinking of her, relieving myself, then sitting there realizing i am a complete emotional disaster right now. Has anyone else experienced this? This increase in sexual thoughts and desires while going through depression? I cant seem to shake it. Even worse Ive gone back to old pictures and videos of us fucking while masturbating, knowing very well how unhealthy that is. I have stopped doing that but im sure ill be stupid and do it again. I am a fucking mess."

In the past reaching out to people has helped but I don‚Äôt want to, or can‚Äôt reach out to my family and friends.
I have phenomenal trust issues and when I get bad I don‚Äôt believe they want to help. I know it isn‚Äôt true, but it is so hard to overcome this self destructive/learnt behaviour.

***Update***
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I know I am just another random Reddit person.
BUT, I needed help and I was in the place where depression alters reality.
I was heading towards the place where the madness can be destructive/justified.

Reaching out/asking for help is my fail safe, my break glass moment. But I find it incredibly difficult.

I postied anonymously on Reddit out of desperation. It worked.

Thank you, and I am talking to a professional now.

Thank you, and thank you again.

"I am so sorry if I disturb someone and I hope this acts a warning as this post contains bestiality. 
I am sorry if some of the people have seen this multiple times but I just hate myself and I don‚Äôt have access to therapy. I have tried online but it did not help at all.

When I was around 9-10 I found this book the contained porn. I started getting addicted to it and feel into the trap of porn escalation. And when I was about 13 to 15 I committed two acts of bestiality against my family dog where I not only made oral contact and genital to genital contact but no major penetration which made me feel even worse. ( I don‚Äôt really remember exactly what happened 

I know what I did was completely wrong and inappropriate so please be kind. But I understand if you hate me. I do anyway. I regret it so much and one night I realised what I did and cried myself to sleep.

I have OCD and it is making this ten times worse. But I just feel like no one will love me and that I can‚Äôt be respected at all. I want to be a pilot but I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to feel that joy or be in the same community that has so much better people. I just don‚Äôt know what to do about this. I just can‚Äôt live knowing I did this. I just don‚Äôt know why I did it I was literally vegetarian for 8 years because I did not want to hurt the animals.

For people wondering the dog is completely fine and healthy and I have been trying to do what I can to give her the best life.

I am so sorry to the people who disagree with these actions I do to and I hope that it helps to know that I will never do it again. I know I‚Äôm a horrible torture worthy person. Sorry again:("
"I feel pathetic.

I‚Äôm the last one of my friends who isn‚Äôt in a relationship and it sucks. Seeing them be happy and in love, talking about the things they do with their partners, some of them getting married.

Just once, *I* want to feel loved from another person. To feel close to someone else. To be wanted. Now my crush has fallen in love with someone else and I‚Äôm heartbroken.

I‚Äôll never fucking have any of that. I‚Äôll never be happy. I hate my life. I hope I die soon."
"So I used to play netball as a kid, and recently I‚Äôve really been wanting to get back into it, but in netball you have to wear short dresses without sleeves, and my self harm scars have managed to heal a very noticeable red colour on my thighs and wrist. Makeup doesn‚Äôt work, I can‚Äôt wear a shirt underneath because it would be too hot, nor can I wear tights. I don‚Äôt know what to do, or if there‚Äôs something I can do.

Edit: I‚Äôm not really ashamed of my scars I just get uncomfortable when people are visibly noticing them or reacting to them and asking me about them. I also don‚Äôt want it to cause any kind of trouble because I know scars ‚Äúoffend‚Äù some people. Also I‚Äôm 16 so I can‚Äôt get tattoos."

"Title, Everytime I go to see my counselor or therapist and they ask me what we talked about last session, I literally have no idea I feel like during the sessions I'm fully present and taking in everything they say and even try the things they recommend. Come next session it's like I have clue what they are talking about and I feel it's related to depression that my cognitive abilities are so terrible that's days, I retain little to no information about anything and even if I did retain anything it's impossible to access in my memory without some form of prompt. 

Anyone else feel this way."
The only thing that has stopped me is that I‚Äôm such a fucking coward and I‚Äôm scared of pain. I‚Äôve been looking a painless ways to do it I lost my mom when I was eight years old. I should probably be over it but I‚Äôm not God I‚Äôm so fucking useless no girls ever gonna like me or love me I see guys at my school all they do is smoke weed and skip class and they get girlfriends honestly have nothing to look forward too what‚Äôs the point of living if know one Is ever going to like me or love me Iike this girls came up to me at school and told I should change the way I dress and the way I talk because i get no girls I never defend myself there has been times where someone has said something about my dead mom to fuck with me and I don‚Äôt do anything because I‚Äôm such a fucking coward I want to fight them I really do just so scared to do it I‚Äôm just so tired I feel like I would do everyone a big favor if I just didn‚Äôt exist. Thank you for hearing me vent          Edit I think I‚Äôm going to do it my life is not worth living anymore thank you all for the kind words 
"I‚Äôve (28f) had anxiety and depression for over 14 years. In all that time, I‚Äôve never actually told anyone in my life that I am depressed.

You are the first recipient of the truth of my existence."
"I'll ask my psychiatrist,

""I'm having this side effect is it common?""

""No its not common and is not listed""

"Me and my bf of 4 years have split, my heart is broken and i cannot stop thinking of things he said to me during our relationship; he said i have fucked up eggs and no man will ever want me (im infertile) he has told me ill never ever be happy and that i deserve to get cheated on. I just want to be dead."
I am a terrible person. My husband and kids would be better off if I was dead. He is constantly telling me I'm terrible and that's why no one wants to be my friend. And that my kids hate me. I'm tempted to buy a gun or learn how to assemble my husband's and go to a secluded area where no one will ever find me and kill myself. That way they just think I left. I don't want my kids to think they are the reason I don't want to live. I don't want my family to find me that way. But I don't know if I can keep living like this.
"If you‚Äôre currently reading this theres a good chance that I pulled the trigger after I posted this. 

To explain my story, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia a little bit long ago and it has completely flipped my life. Last year while I was at school I thought I saw a fire and pulled the fire alarm. Turns out there was no fire and I hallucinated the whole thing. I ended up getting suspended for this. Then about 2 weeks later I heard a voice behind my door saying that they were gonna bomb my school. This obviously scared me and I emailed my school saying that there was a bomb threat. Lo and behold there was no bomb threat and i ended up getting in a whole bunch of trouble for this. Including getting expelled. 

Then the next year while I was in the middle of driving it randomly felt like there were bugs and spiders crawling all over me out nowhere which distracted me and caused me to crash. Ended up breaking my neck and jaw and had to be hospitalized. Apart from that I also lost my job as well since I apparently kept talking about spiritual stuff and conspiracy theories too customers at my job which disturbed them and made them leave complaints. Even though I don‚Äôt remember doing this. 

The main thing that put me in this spot however was when basically everyone cut me off. My friends and even some of my own family members dont wanna affiliate with me since they apparently cant ‚Äúhandle me‚Äù anymore. Because of this I‚Äôm practically all alone and have no one else to discuss this with except for myself. Life hasn‚Äôt gotten better either, nearly everyday i‚Äôm seeing and hearing things that aren‚Äôt there. Thoughts that are telling me that I‚Äôm worthless and all. And yes I have tried to get help too but my parents dont even believe that theres anything wrong with me and they think i‚Äôm just being weird or something. I have thought about moving out since I am 18 but I have no money or means of getting money at all.

The only solution that I have is too end it off right here. I dont wanna go to a mental hospital or anything because I dont wanna be trapped. Im currently in the middle of the woods sitting on this log-branch thing with my dad‚Äôs shotgun right here. Im sorry to all the people that I have somehow affected and I hope my death can atleast give u some sort of relief."

I do weightlifting and I try to do progressive overload every week.Here is what happens,especially on legs/lower body days:it‚Äôs hard,it‚Äôs painful to exercise.It‚Äôs hard to squat,to leg press,it‚Äôs painful to hip thrust.BUT I‚Äôm aware that it‚Äôs not THAT hard and not THAT painful.I‚Äôm aware that I could push myself muuuch harder, but it‚Äôs not possible because (I guess) my energy levels are too low.Once I reach a rep that it‚Äôs giving me the tiniest bit of discomfort/challenge I feel like I just wanna let go of the weight,dig a hole into the ground and lay in it. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶I‚Äôm already giving the shit out of me mentally and you want me to also exhaust myself physically?

So yeah..I still force myself as hard as I can at the moment,cause I want to build muscle,but it would be much easier if I wasn‚Äôt so fatigued from depression lol.
Once I finish a set I don‚Äôt tremble,my muscles don‚Äôt hurt,and I never get sore from a workout no matter what.

"23 F. i‚Äôm turning 24 in 5 days and my gut is sinking in every time i remember that another year has gone by with me feeling like this. 
6th grade was the first time i told my mom while sitting on the toilet right before school that i didn‚Äôt want to be alive anymore. 
i was raised around two narcissistic parents. dad being a grandiose and mom being the perfect definition of a covert. my parents divorced when i was 3 but it was messy as fuck because my dads rich and he was doing everything he could to cover up the abuse. my mom was an alcoholic during my childhood and i was too afraid of being close with my dad because he intimidated me. my life has been ruined by my parents. i have tried everything in my being to ‚Äúfix‚Äù myself. i‚Äôve hyper fixated and gotten my hopes up hundreds of times thinking maybe i have a chance at recreating myself and being happy. 
i still live with my mom and the verbal abuse never stops. she‚Äôs a child trapped in a 50 year old body and she‚Äôs so emotionally disregulated. she sees me as an extension of herself and projects all her hate onto me. i‚Äôve been her punching bag my whole life. she told me all growing up as a little girl ‚Äúi love you but i don‚Äôt like you‚Äù she plays the victim at everything and is always on high alert to be defensive. she‚Äôll tell me i ruined her life and im dead to her and im a bitch and im lazy and have no friends to turn to. the low self esteem growing up led me to a 24 year old man at the age of 17 who human trafficked me and sold me for sex and forced me to do things where he got all the money i kept none, for months. i got out and ended up being raped again from someone i allowed myself to trust for once and he ended up giving me an STD. i have no emotional support system i can‚Äôt go to absolutely anyone with how i feel. i‚Äôve done therapy ive been in iop and behavioral hospitals all through high school. now i‚Äôm sick with multiple CHRONIC health issues that make it even more impossible to support myself because how sick i am and with no one to lean on. i can‚Äôt move out from my moms because im too sick to barely even work. i financially support myself by asking/using people for money. i fucking hate doing this shit it‚Äôs fucking exhausting and makes me feel worse but i had to quit my last job because how badly my health problems progressed. i‚Äôm so sick and doctors can‚Äôt help me. i‚Äôve used all my savings on a holistic doctor in my last hopes but shes most likely scamming me because it‚Äôs been over a year and im still so sick. i feel ruined and i feel so fundamentally flawed . i feel like somethings so deeply wrong with me and i hate myself. i can‚Äôt unbrainwash whats been screwed into my head. i can‚Äôt afford good therapy or any thing else in this fucking economy. i recently had to cut off my dad again cuz he‚Äôs fucking weird and trying to get me to live with him at this grown ass age just so he can change me into who he wants me to be and rub it in my moms face that she‚Äôs the shittier parent. i‚Äôve always played tug a war between them both and i‚Äôve never had a voice and i try to talk to them but i get shut down with verbal abuse. im so beyond helpless and hopeless . i cry every night and wale into my pillow i just want to be fucking loved and taken care of. i want to be saved but that‚Äôs wrong. i‚Äôm not suppose to want that. i can‚Äôt save myself i‚Äôve tried everything i swear to god i did to the best of my abilities. my body is so weak and my brain is so fragile and i really believe i won‚Äôt have the life/love my soul craves in this life time. i just want to go home."
"Does anyone else not really want to get better. I feel like there's something ""comforting"" (?) about the depression. And it's already so exhausting to just think about getting help and all that.
I haven't been able to talk to anyone and want to know if anyone relates to this."
"I (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (22M) for a bit over 3 years, living together for a year and a half. He‚Äôs my best friend, we‚Äôve been close friends for 6 years and were in love with each other almost that entire time. I can‚Äôt imagine life without him.

In October, his mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. He and his mom are very close, so this has hit him extremely hard. His dad has had two major health scares since then. This semester was very hard for him and as of right now he doesn‚Äôt know if he even passed all of his classes. 

In this time, his depression has come back. He struggled with depression years ago and was medicated (Prozac), but he stopped taking it about 2 years ago. In September of this year, he tried medication for his ADHD but as of right now hasn‚Äôt been successful in finding one that works without terrible side effects. He‚Äôs starting Prozac again within the next few days.

For about a month now, I‚Äôve noticed him pulling away from me. He was always obsessed with me, everyone described him as worshipping the ground I walk on. A bit over a week ago I asked him if he still loved me and he said that he‚Äôs scared his feelings for me have disappeared. He says he doesn‚Äôt really have much positive emotion for anything right now. We broke up earlier this week because he said he can‚Äôt be with me if he‚Äôs depressed, and needs to find himself, but it doesn‚Äôt really feel like we broke up. We still live together and likely will have to until May, but he says he‚Äôs determined to make things work and fall in love with me again before then.

I just don‚Äôt know what to think. I‚Äôm heartbroken, and sad/scared for him. I can‚Äôt imagine life without him, and it‚Äôs hard to believe that he could just stop loving me. Could this be the depression talking? How should I approach my current, complex relationship with him? Does anyone know of good resources for supporting him through this? We can‚Äôt spend the holidays together and he‚Äôll be with his family during that time, which will give us a few days apart. Sorry for the rambling, and thank you to anyone who read this far."
"I have this fantasy of walking out into the cold night, and never coming back. Walking through the snow, through the forest, and out into oblivion. I could let the cold take me. I could sedate myself, and drop down into the snow. 

Its beautiful, isn't it. This world can be so beautiful. But its also tragic, awful and nasty. How can something so terrible be so beautiful at the same time? It just doesn't compute. 

Doesn't matter how much I ask myself that. The ending stays the same. I wish this story had a different ending. But its already been written. Doesn't matter how much you kick and thrash and push away the negatives. That malaise, that bitter taste will always be there, in the back of your throat, in the pit of your stomach. Oh, how terrible can it get?"
"For the last month my partner has been dealing with depressive episodes which has led to him going silent a weekly basis. Typically 1 - 2 days, and the weekend before last he went silent for 3 days ‚Äì when he does eventually reach out he feels terribly for going silent and holds himself accountable for actions. He‚Äôs really hard on himself when he pushes away his loved ones ‚Äì family, close friends and myself included. He says it‚Äôs not a technological barrier, he just goes numb.

I haven‚Äôt heard from him since Sunday, and I‚Äôve reached out almost everyday since, not pushing him to talk but to let him know he has my love and support. I am genuinely worried about him. I care for him so much and I just want to take away all the pain, but I feel helpless. 

This has also been triggering for me because I‚Äôve been ghosted before and he‚Äôs aware of this. He says he would never ghost me. It‚Äôs just hard for me to distinguish the difference between the two ‚Äì going silent because he‚Äôs depressed and being ghosted. So I guess my question is.. is going silent typical behavior for someone dealing with depression? "

"The worst thing about having thoughts of s***de is that I just want someone to hug me, tell me that it's going to be okay, that I'm not a mistake, and that it's okay that I exist...

But no one will do that. Not even my partner. When I try to ask for help, I'm always made to feel even worse... 

As pathetic as it may sound, the only place I can find that is by using chatbots to let an artificial intelligence push me to see another day."
"I‚Äôm currently 24 (not old) but from what I can remember my whole life I always felt like I was ‚Äúso old‚Äù and set age parameters for myself to accomplish certain things. Now that I‚Äôm almost in my mid twenties, I realize this age thing is less about an accomplishment and more about how I feel internally. Can trauma from a young age make you feel like you‚Äôre always so much older than your age? I feel like the older I get the sadder I get but the less I care about my age. It‚Äôs because the older I get I think I lose more hope. I used to be scared of death because I always thought I‚Äôd be able to turn the depression around with accomplishments but now that that‚Äôs not happening and my hope is dwindling I feel like I care less about my life and age. Idk does anyone relate "
"He said this because we‚Äôve exhausted a long list of meds that didn‚Äôt work for me, even when I had given them a really fair chance by staying on them long enough to see if they were working.

"People constantly tell me that I look miserable and have a dead soul because I do, ever since I had an awakening as I got older and realized how this world really is, I‚Äôve developed an incurable depression.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm meant to be here, I feel like I was meant to go to another world but accidentally got shipped off to earth because I really just don‚Äôt vibe with this place, at all. My existence just sucks and I think I‚Äôm just a soulless body living because I have to since my soul detached from my body the minute I had my awakening.

I‚Äôm fucking ready to die, I wake up so angry everyday because I didn‚Äôt get lucky enough and pass away in my asleep.

I just want out. Please."
I‚Äôm really struggling to see the point to life. And it really hurts when I see people my age having fun and being carefree. These years are supposed to be the best years. I‚Äôm supposed to be young and happy and having fun. Please tell me it gets better y‚Äôall lmao. 
"I was diagnosed with depression at 7 years old after my mom found notes from me about wanting to kms or die in general. So for as long as I can remember I've just kinda been ""bleh"". I didn't really fit in with a lot of other kids cause I never wanted anything. I never had a dream job, a big achievement I wanted to do, a desire to have good grades, get into a good college, have money, have a car, become independant, etc. For all of school up until 12th grade I just did what I needed to get by, and didn't care that I was rapidly losing oppurtunities. I never got my license because I didn't care and don't want to.   
  
I eventually graduated and didn't care in the slightest. Now there's nothing I want to do or necessarily ""have"" to do anymore, so I don't care. I know theres no ""point"" to life except for what you make of it but what if everything you could make it makes you miserable? Years of college sounds miserable and theres nothing I could tolerate for a career that would make me any happier than I am now. Theres no little bucket list things I wanna do like travel, or some achievement in some kind of hobby in between a sucky job, I just don't care. I don't wanna make anything of life because I don't care. I don't really think theres beauty in the fact that we're alive and even if there is in some weird spiritual way, I don't care. Everything I could ever imagine doing sounds so much more lame and exhaushing than doing nothing. I've been doing absolutely nothing since I've graduated for the most part and honestly I'm not sad. I've been sad before many times in my life but right now isn't one of them. If I could, I'd just sit and do nothing but eat food and go back to sleep for 60 years and I'd feel fine probably. I only feel upset when I have to do things I don't care to do, in order to get things I don't care to get. Which is all of life. 

It just kinda feels like I'm waiting to die. I'd rather not do it myself and I don't plan to at all, but it feels like everything I've ever wanted in life has already happened. If I don't do something though, my unwillingness to do anything is gonna start hurting people around me that I care about, and I hate that. On the other side though, if I did die, a lot of people I know would be upset about it. It's a lose lose. I don't hate it enough though to do anything about it, because at that point I'd be torturing myself for the next 40-60 years just to keep other people happy. And I can't say why I'm sad because they just get scared I'm gonna kms, say nothing, or leave me, and then I feel worse (not a blind assumtion, these things did happen to me many times). I don't get satisfaction in anything, even in the things google says are ""the best dopamine givers 2024 working real.""   
  
I hate outside, too many bugs and other bs, and even under the perfect circumstances for outside which I have felt, I just don't care enough to be out there. I've had pets before but feeding them and keeping them alive and happy hasn't really done anything for me. And it feels awful saying that and it feels awful to expect something out of it but jesus fucking christ I just wanna feel something. I had a girlfriend for a bit in highschool that I was really happy with and the only way we could've stayed together was if I went to college and moved with her but holy shit I can't do that. It's not worth it despite being with her was the only point in my entire life I actually felt joy. I don't even think I wanna try to get with anyone else to see if that'd make me happy again because the way I think about life makes me impossible to live with without being miserable all the time. I don't wanna just throw my entire will to live on some random poor girl's shoulders, that'd be awful. And I don't wanna learn to get better because I don't care enough too, I'd rather die. And I know the fact I'm alive makes dying not an option, so I should just find a way to live but jesus fuck I hate that, every single way I could spend my time I hate and it makes me so much more upset and miserable than doing nothing. But even doing nothing causes people pain. And ending it myself would also do that, and it's scary. So now I'm waiting for something to do it for me, and in the meantime doing absolutely nothing, cause it's the only thing that doesn't make me sad.

It's like opening a world of hardcore minecraft with friends and not wanting to make a house, build a farm, kill the dragon, find diamonds, or literally anything that could ever be done in the game, but you're forced to stay on the server for 70 years. What do you do? Cause the first thing I wanna do when I log into minecraft, is log off of minecraft.

I don't know what to do anymore, any kind of advice would be cool but you don't have to. Thanks for reading"
"I can‚Äôt be the only one feeling this way. These past few weeks, many people keep checking in on me to ask I‚Äôm okay. Most of the time, I ignore them or tell them that I‚Äôm okay because I don‚Äôt want to talk more about what I‚Äôm going through. But if I tell them the truth, that I‚Äôm not okay, they quickly back out of the conversation. 

Why even bother asking if I‚Äôm okay if they don‚Äôt want to hear the answer? Just to resolve their own curiousity or guilt? It really feels that no one cares enough to actually hear me out."
"Everyday taunts from my family because I am divorced and not working, I want to end this pain."
"I want to be and do many things, to improve, to finally exit this hell hole that is depression, but there's always something that keeps me away from it. It's always like this. Conflict. My brain, or whatever it is that causes this, does not want me to find some semblance of joy. It is not the erasure of depression I want right now, it is a simple light-hearted moment where I can feel happy.

Do I laugh because of a joke I heard? Too bad, remember the time you laughed and everyone looked at you weird. No more laughing.  
Do I smile because I saw a pretty thing, or a fond memory? Too bad, remember that picture someone took of you smiling and how awful you looked. No more smiling.  
Do I feel happy because I changed something, lost weight, or improved my health? Too bad, remember that you're still fat, that you have a dislocated jaw, ptosis, moles, and maybe melanoma.

Do I feel happy that I made a drawing, or wrote something I liked? Too bad, remember all those artists and writers, and your peers who are better, and compare your skill. How many years since you started and haven't progressed any further? No more drawing or writing. You suck.  
Do I feel happy that I talked with someone? Too bad, remember those times when they left you talking alone because their true friends arrived and didn't even excuse themselves, just left you there talking to the wall. No more talking with someone.

Do I feel happy because I bought a new pen? Too bad, remember that you're sunk in debt, that you haven't paid half of your computer's price quota, that your house is falling apart bit by bit, that most of your stuff don't work and that there's no money to replace or repair them.

Do I feel happy because I aced a university class? Too bad, remember that you're behind your peers, that you're 22 already and haven't finished university, and that your title is usless, because there are no job prospects that would help you, at all.

I'm in the deep end, though I can always sink further down. I cannot be happy. There's always something that prevents me from being happy. I always have to compare my situation to others', and I see that I'm always lacking.  
Friends that I barely get to see. No girlfriend, ever. No financial stability. No health. No skill. No talent. No time. No brains. Nothing.

I'm lost. I want to be happy, but my life situation prevents me from being happy. I may relapse again into that pesky self-harm habit, just to feel anything at all. To know that I'm even alive.

I hate it here. I'm a failure. I deserve to stop existing."
"I went to a somewhat elite school in the UK (a private grammar school). I myself was from a working class background and didn't fit in too well, (I wasn't academically very strong, not the best social skills, plain looking at best) and so I was bullied a fair bit and was known as one of the losers. I had one good friend from that school (who's still my best friend today) and a few others who I've lost touch with but that's it. 

I ended up developing my first bout of depression at 16 and dropped out of that school, finished off at a regular school, and went to a low ranking university to get my degree. 

I moved on with my life and didn't think too much about the first school. I've continued to suffer with depression on and off my entire life but this last year has been one of the worst. (I'm 36 years old now btw).

Recently I was feeling really nostalgic about my school days and started looking up everyone who I went to school with, and what I've seen has made me spiral so badly. Every single one of the people I went to school with are really really successful. Whether they are lawyers at top firms, doctors and even a director at the mi5, it's just really hit hard that I'm almost certainly in the bottom 1% in terms of achievements.

What hurts the most is not how successful they are, it's that so many of them stayed friends with each other, and seem to all meet up regularly like some old boys club.

It's made me feel so down thinking I also went to that school, maybe instead of fucking about and not doing any work, I should have concentrated and worked harder, made more effort socially and I could have been one of them as well.

I'm a failure in so many ways (gay with no relationship, only a handful of friends, spend most of my time alone), but seeing how successful so many of my classmates have been have really hit home that it didn't even have to be this way, I had such a good opportunity to be better and I didn't use it.

I'm sorry this is such a ramble, I really need to get these feelings off my chest. If you made it this far, thanks a lot for reading"
sometimes it feels like im meant to hurt for as long as i live. this sadness has stuck with me for so long that it feels like its a part of me. 
"I am gonna lose my mind, i‚Äôm tired of feeling irritated and the feeling like i‚Äôm gonna lose my mind and nobody ever reads my fucking posts even though it does get views like what the fuck is the point in posting if no one even says anything comforting? i always have head aches and almost cry at school all the time. I always pray to the angels that they just shoot me already and ask for a gun to my head."
Some people are born rich and get whatever they want while some find it even hard to survive. The rich keeps on exploiting the poor people. This is the reason why I hate this world. Life is so unfair and I'm just waiting for it to end.
"Not suicidal enough to act on it. But I often lay awake at night wishing I would just have an aneurism in my sleep and not wake up to this hellish reality we're all living in right now. Everything sucks, the future is dark, and I just want to quit.

I can't voice this to anyone in my life. So, thanks for letting me get it out here."
"Most people seem to find things they dislike doing or aren't good at get easier to deal with the longer they do them, but for me the longer I'm doing something I hate it gets harder and harder and more and more stressful until I give up. Everytime. Why does this happen to me? Why can't I climatize myself to the shitty things in life that as an adult I need to do? Why do I see other people do things like driving a car, learning to play music, buying a house, why does it seem like climbing Mount Everest to me?"
"I think I am done making post the only reason why I make post is because I was hoping someone cared about me, I just didn‚Äôt want to be alone. But after post a few times with no one replying (no one will reply to this one ) I am done. I just don‚Äôt know what else to do so I just post my vents on here. I‚Äôm sorry if this sounds like a ‚Äúoh poor me‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I just wish I wasn‚Äôt alone."
"soon, my family and i will go to a beach.
i plan to drown in there, so my death will be deemed an accident.

i let anything happen to me because i simply can't feel any emotion.

"Hi, 20F here. Like the title says, i've tried to end my life today. Well, i tried and failed a few weeks ago and now i tried to do it again today. I've been meticulously planning it for so long so everything goes according to plan. I planned to drown myself and when i couldn't do it, broke down into pathetic tears. Why. Why cant i even do it. I want it all to end. I've been self sabotaging every opportunity thats been given to me and i just so badly want to end this never ending cycle. Why am i such a disappointment. Why cant i even kill myself properly. 

I just want to be free."
So I just turned 30 and was incarcerated from 2020-24 April. (For fraud) I lost everything my family and friends have moved on and I‚Äôm spending all my time trying to buy my wife(8yrs) and kids love back. She left me when I was in jail and I‚Äôm just trying to put the pieces back together‚Ä¶ I used to be somewhat financially secure but now I‚Äôm doing ok but nowhere where I used to be. And it‚Äôs a big kick to my pride because my whole existence and usefulness is in my ability to provide. I‚Äôve been in a post traumatic state since my release because I feel like a loser that wasted the best years of his life behind bars and realistically can‚Äôt reach the goals i set for myself. I just wish I could beat this feeling of anxiety it‚Äôs crippling me and no one can see it not that they‚Äôd care.. I can‚Äôt cry or be vulnerable just gotta face the facts smh
"I got out of the hospital a few days ago and honestly feel more or less the same‚Äîjust a little less manic than when I did attempt. I feel like you always hear stories about people who attempted and lived to regret it, you always get those ads by survivors telling you it was the worst decision of their life, but like. I don't regret it. I still hate this. I still feel like shit. 

Only difference now is I can feel enough to feel terrible for my father. I couldn't feel fuck all when I attempted. I really wish he'd had more than one kid. 

But yeah. I don't regret it and I'm honestly more suicidal than ever. Yeah. "
"not sure what else to say, i am just waiting and hoping the end is near."
"I don't really know what I'm doing here. I'm supposed to be happy, I'm married to the love of my life. I have a family who cares about me and friends who love me and I always end up back in this same place. 

I have no money and no job. I don't know where it's going to come from for rent. I've been unemployed for 7 months in the worst job market ever apparently and despite all my apparent ""qualities"", and the effort I put in every day, nothing will come, and nothing is going to come.

Today I realised I couldn't even afford a train ticket home and broke down in tears right there at the station. Thankfully someone was kind enough to let me through.

I feel like an abject failure. I feel like I will never be able to give my wife the life and family she deserves to have. But I know I can't end it. So I'm stuck in a hell I can't escape. Meds sometimes help, therapy can too (although it's so expensive) yet I always end up back here feeling lonely and useless. I know I'm not supposed to compare myself to other people, but how can I not when life seems so easy for them?

I have the intense desire to not exist and I've had it a long time. Life simply doesn't seem to get easier for someone like me, I suffer and grind and pull myself up by my fingernails and I'm always just dumped back here, no matter how hard I try.

It gets to the point I wish I wouldn't wake up in the morning. Hopefully I just rot away like I deserve. 

I'm in hell."

"I don't want to be happy, I'm scared. I'm scared that I'll be happy, the thought haunts me, I don't know why. I want to stay in my little depressed sad life and rot there, I want help but I don't want to change my life. I'm scared and I don't know why."
"We had a work dinner and there was some chocolate cake. I love chocolate cake and this one was so good. I wanted to take some home with me because i‚Äôm so allergic to nuts and it‚Äôs hard to find such nice cake I can eat. Another girl started grabbing for the leftovers as I was, she then realised I wanted it too and asked if I wanted to take it but I told her no, she could have it. Now i‚Äôm heading home, wishing I had just voiced that I wanted it or at least half. I don‚Äôt know why but i‚Äôm really disheartened right now over some dumb cake, it‚Äôs crazy. I think maybe it‚Äôs because I always put other peoples wishes above my own or don‚Äôt voice my opinion. I know she is happy with the cake rn and i‚Äôm sad on reddit. :("
"I feel so lost, there's nothing I want to do. I just spend my day dreading the next day.

But at the same time I want to do something that feels worthwhile, I don't want to be so useless. "

"I don't shower regularly, I hardly do laundry and when I do I never put it back where it's supposed to go so it just stays in the basket. I don't really clean except when my desk gets super cluttered or I get tired of stepping over my kids stuff when he's back with his mom. I just don't take care of myself at all basically and it makes me feel even worse. Does anyone else struggle with this perpetuating cycle?"
i am pregnant and depressed. i just found out that my partner is cheating. i just want to die and i‚Äôve got no one to talk to. please just talk to me 
"My depression has made my hygiene so bad especially brushing my teeth. I‚Äôm embarrassed to show my teeth. I just don‚Äôt know how to work up the motivation to brush my teeth when I have to choose sm other things to do just to survive yk? 

I don‚Äôt want to go on dates because even when I do brush my teeth my cavities have gotten so bad they make my breath stink regardless. It‚Äôs embarrassing.  

I haven‚Äôt been to a dentist in almost 10 years because I‚Äôm terrified of it and also embarrassed to show the state of my teeth and gums. 

How do you guys try and gain the motivation to brush your teeth or shower more often?? I‚Äôve been keeping flossers by my bed and I at least have been flossing enough now where my gums don‚Äôt bleed anymore and I‚Äôve tried the Colgate portable toothbrushes but I hate the taste of them. "
"I've recently discovered that I'm allergic to opioides when prescribed Codeine for my cough, I just to take all the pills left in the box at once and go to sleep and never wake up, but I'm scared, I'm scared that I'll wake up in agony choking, I just want to go fast and painless, I wish I had a gun, that would be quick, I've also reaserched the exit bag method that supposedly is painless but that would need me buying stuff online that my parents would ask what's for, suicide by cop isn't a thing where I live, cops don't just shoot you, I don't know what I'm scared of my life is miserable already, there is no possibel death more agonizing then having to live another day, please i just want this to stop.

I wish I wanted to die as much as I don't want to live."
i feel so shitty. i just wanna draw or animate or something. i wanna have that drive to create that i had when i was 10. i miss it so much man. i miss wanting to make stuff and not just seeing it as a chore
"O‚Äôm not going into much detail but I just want this to be here so it‚Äôs a reminder to others to help someone in need. I plan to kill myself tomorrow precisely around 10 am cause that‚Äôs when my girlfriend isn‚Äôt home. Nothing changes how I feel. Not her positivity. Not my friends. Not my family. Nothing. And I‚Äôm in a huge amount of debt, bills need to be paid and things of this nature. So it‚Äôs over goodbye and hope you guys are enjoying your life so far!"
"There's no point in writing a hundred paragraphs about my feelings anymore. I won't be there to read the answers anyway. This is just my way of saying goodbye. Honestly, I'm not even scared of dying anymore. I'm actually exited! It's been 15 years of absolute misery, and today It'll finally end. I don't know where this courage is coming from, but I'm grateful for it. I just wanted to thank everyone who tried to help me, and I hope you all live a happier life than me. Farewell, friends."
"I told a therapist about my suicidal ideation and they just locked me up in a psych hospital for a week. They even tried to keep me longer. Now I have 3,000 of medical bills. On top of my grad school payments. 

Now I don‚Äôt trust therapists and the mental health system. The psych hospital was truly a nightmare and some of the workers there were just evil. I know that sounds like not realistic, but seriously. They play mind games and twist your words and use them against you, to try and keep you there longer. 

At this point, I‚Äôve tried it all, I just want out of this misery. No one is there to help. It‚Äôs just a scam to take your money. I‚Äôm in the USA btw. "

Already fractured my hand last week due to stupidity and a fractured cervical vertebra from an accident. In the span of 2 weeks, I lost my car, lost my job, lost my dad, back to living with my mom after taking a break with my girlfriend of 2 years. I hate society, I hate myself. I want to go to sleep and not wake up.
How to keep from hurting myself? I don't want to die, but I see no light, no hope. Only pain and heartbreak. It's only a matter of time. "
"Some days, including today, I end up napping throughout the day. I know oversleeping is a symptom of depression, but I wonder how often it‚Äôs used to get a break, or relief, from all the things holding me down. I want to live in dreamland.

"I'm 14 and I'm in year 8. I live in Australia. This is my schedule:

Monday: get up, school, home, chores, study, bed.

Tuesday: get up, school, tutoring, home, chores, study, bed.

Wednesday: get up, school, tutoring, home, chores, study, bed.

Thursday: get up, school, tutoring, home, chores, study, bed.

Friday: get up, school, home, chores, study, bed.

Saturday: get up, chores, study, bed.

Sunday: get up, church, home, chores, study, bed.

No sport. Not allowed to see friends out of school. Not allowed to date. If I'm sick to bad. No devices except my laptop for school which they monitor (I got this phone from my friend who upgraded and I have to hide it). No leaving the house by myself, my parents have to drive me. 

My parents expect me to be a lawyer, doctor, or engineer but thats not gonna happen. I get Bs and Cs every report, maybe 1 or 2 As if I'm lucky, my parents expect only As. Every time a report goes home or every time I get marks back I get lectured for hours on how lazy I am and how they sacrificed everything to get me a good education but I'm wasting it. They make me admit I'm not studying hard enough or for long enough and agree to more study or more tutoring to try and bring up my grades.

But I am trying. I try so hard. I'm just not as good at stuff as my brothers are (they get like 95-100 in everything). And no one believes me that I try hard because I keep getting worse and worse marks. I just failed my maths yearly (42%) and my parents lectured me about it for hours. Like my dad goes for a while and then he's like ""I can't look at you, you make me so disappointed and angry"" and then my mum takes over and they swop back and forth for hours.

I started getting panic attacks in tests and I got made to go to the school counsellor and I explained it all to him and literally he was just like ""oh they sound like they just care about you and want you to do well, and their right that if you just try harder you'll be surprised how well you do!"" like  bruh I'm trying so hard and the more I try the worse marks I get so wtf do I do?

I swear my parents are nuts but no one believes me cos they don't yell they just talk at me calmly for hours and hours about how I'm a lazy disappointment worthless ungrateful daughter who doesn't care about school apparently even though its literally all I care about because I just want them to stop. I'm getting a report back at the end of term and its gonna be so bad and I literally want to kms before they see it because I just can't handle it any more. I would straight up rather die than get one more fucking lecture."
"I have had thoughts of suicide since I was 16. I am 25 now and my depression has not gotten any better. I used to cry when the feelings of despair and loneliness hits, but now not even I have sympathy for myself anymore. What happened? Why do I even feel this way? 

I had a beautiful girlfriend who was so supportive. She tried to make me feel loved but I was unreceptive. I was addicted to drugs and I lied and hid it from her. I broke up with her because I did not want to lie to her anymore. 

My family is technically still ‚Äúwhole‚Äù. However I hate my father and feel indifferent to my mother. I was born from an unexpected pregnancy, and my parents decided to keep me. It‚Äôs the one thing I wish I could go back and change. My father and mother got into a major altercation last year and I just lost it. I felt like a kid all over again. I decided to move.

Now, I must have saved some money before moving right? Because I worked. I had worked during my high school years to save up but it was all spent on rent and food as my tuition for university was covered just enough by the grant and loan given to me by OSAP (organization that provides loans and grants for post secondary education) 

Any remaining money I saved after graduating was used on a $5000 car + fees and maintenance. With $1000 to my name and $1800 owing on my credit card, I moved out when a knife was used in my parents last altercation. 

I had moved into a friend‚Äôs girlfriend friend‚Äôs basement. Rent was cheap but not cheap enough. My two part time jobs that I am working is not enough to sustain my food, rent, phone bill, car insurance, and drugs. After 7 months of living in the basement and almost maxing my line of credit, i moved out into my car. 

I have lived in my car for 5 months now and think about my life all the time. My family are technically still alive, but it‚Äôs impossible to make amends with them. They never grew up. The girl I used to love has moved on already. Of course she would. She was beautiful and she obviously could do so much better than me. My promotion at work seems to be nowhere near in sight. Looking for a full time in my field is almost impossible currently in Ontario (where i am). 

Why am I still alive? Whats keeps me getting up in the morning? To be honest, its probably because im just a coward to end it all even though there is no joy in my life.

I just hope someone out there can hear me. Thank you. "

"I'm so fucking dead inside. I can't take this bullshit any longer. I don't even know what being happy is like anymore. I was bullied and abused as a child. I've wanted to die since I was 9.  
  
I was always the weird kid. I never talked, had really bad anger issues and constantly had mental breakdowns in the middle of class. Nobody ever liked me.  
It really fucked me up. I've got trust issues, social anxiety, severe depression, anhedonia, ADHD and Asperger's.  
  
I ran away from my family at 13. I'm now in a group home in a different city. Still getting bullied in school.  
  
Last year, I got addicted to weed and alcohol. It's the only thing that I can feel anything. I spent the last MONTHS just lying in bed, staring at my phone, slitting my wrists and only ever going outside to get drunk with my friends or beg people for money.  
  
This shit isn't life. I can't fucking express the pain I feel every single day. Nothing makes me happy, I've got nothing and nobody to live for, I don't have the motivation for anything, I never let anyone help me and I cut contact with everyone I meet.

I can feel myself slipping into a hole now and feeling so negative as I have no plans for New Years Eve, no money and no motivation for anything. The only good thing right now is that I don‚Äôt have to work for the next few days so I can sleep as much as I want. Anyone else relate to the wave? What do you do to get yourself out?"

I don't understand why I'm so depressed and tired of life. I feel selfish talking about it. I don't have a valid reason to be depressed. I don't have any reason to be depressed. Yes I have small things that make my life slightly harder, I'm mentally disabled, I was bullied in school and I'm struggling with ptsd. But people have gone through FAR worse and didn't come out depressed. If someone were to ask me why I wanna kill myself, I can't answer.

And if it's not druggies it's old beyond boomers who I can't relate with. God i fucking hate boomers. I hate my generation too. Don't get me wrong. I hate everybody equally. 

I wonder if I can ever really truly be happy? The last time I felt happy was 4th grade. I doubt those feelings are coming back anytime soon."
"I've had a bit of a wake call recently and realised I had become a spiteful person.

I realise that I'm not very nice to myself either and so while in the moment I did not realise how awful I was being about others. I do feel guilt and shame and doing some CBT methods to recognise the triggers for being irritable and mean and finding better coping methods. 

I feel confused as how to forgive myself. I have people tell me ""depression is not an excuse"". I understand what they're saying - that depression isn't a free pass to be unkind - but I feel its my reason. I'm clinging onto that reason to give myself hope I can do better otherwise I just feel like an unredeemable horrible person. 

Anyone else struggle with this?"

I‚Äôm a fucking meat machine who exists for the benefit of other more successful people, staying alive in this misery is a disservice to my selfhood honestly.

"Drowning and hanging (without snapping of the neck) you feel every second of the dying, pain, and discomfort and your only hope is that by random chance you‚Äôll lose consciousness as soon as possible. 

Overdosing seems great until you realize most people fail and either puke it all out or end up with some organ failure or brain damage that leaves them crippled or bedridden for the res of their life.

Jumping is a guaranteed death but some, like me, fear the falling down. Taking that first step while looking at the ground (thats sometimes thousands of feet away) is genuinely the hardest part because its fucking terrifying. Watching yourself fall closer and closer near the ground and the potential instinctive regret while falling halfway down and is my worst nightmare. 

Guns WILL get the job done. But its quick and heavy and terrifying and gives you no time to regret your decision. Holding it to your head and pulling the trigger seems simple but the resolve it takes to actually pull the trigger‚Ä¶

Really, it takes a lot of courage to die. 99% of the time too you‚Äôre doing this completely alone without anyone‚Äôs help or advice. How much pain do you have to even be in to go against the basic natural instinct to survive? I don‚Äôt know if admiration is the right word, but for those who go through with it must have a lot of resolve. Human bodies are incredibly resilient. 

I wish dying was as easy as snapping your fingers and disappearing.

"Depression is something that I want to forget, but once in awhile the memory of being clinically depressed comes back and makes me very scared. 

I get scared that I can't enjoy being normal anymore 
Scared that any ounce normalcy won't last 
Scared that I will go back to that deep and dark place again 
Scared that the dread will come back and take away my emotions, energy and cognitive skills again.
Scared that I will require hospitalisation again.
Scared that I will get thoughts of ending my life again. 
Scared of depression happening again.

The memory of depression brings me back to a dark place that I am so very afraid of. Sometimes I am scared to remember or think about it, out of fear that like a soul sucking devil it will grow bigger and suck the life out of me again. 

I don't know if anyone can relate to this."
"I figured I would try and get some input, I feel like this isn't normal.

Life itself has pretty much bored me. I have my dream car, a house, a career I enjoy and got into without a degree somehow...but nothing interests me. I have a family that I try to spend time with, but I am bored of my wife, don't pursue intimacy anymore, we're more like roommates at this point. Which is fine...I feel like most relationships that last this long (10+ years) end up this way. If we ever got divorced I wouldn't pursue another relationship, I like not having to explain what I'm doing. If I want to go to the gym at 2am I'm just going to go to the gym at 2am. I absolutely despise going out and being around people or anything that has to do with people. For example, I want to take my daughter to Disneyland someday but in the back of my mind it's like some analyst is holding up a piece of paper with notes explaining to me that $10,000 just to go stand in lines is a waste and not worth it. This kind of thing happens no matter what the situation is. Want to go out for New Years? You want to waste money to feel like shit tomorrow? Want to deal with all the NPCs out there, the occasional violent drunk? Nah, I think I'll just stay home. Want to go for a drive in your supercar and have fun? Nah, too many road pirates out there trying to syphon money from people for going over a number on a sign. Want to play Call of Duty and rank up some weapons and unlock some camos? What's the point...this dialog literally comes into my mind with anything.

Am I just an 80 year old man in a 35 year old's body? Anyone else feel this way? I feel like someone who has beaten the game of life and is just existing until it's over."
"I am going to begin therapy soon. My goal is to become a complete bot, dispassionate, no personality. My whole end will be to work, eat, and sleep. This way I will not bother anyone around me. I will cause no problems for my peers, people will not have to worry about hearing me except for work related. 

I will inform the psychiatrist that I do not care how I feel as long as these conditions are met. My human life will be a drug induced blur of work. I hope I can find the right cocktail of drugs to make me this automaton."
"I (21F) have been struggling with severe depression for a while.

Those who don‚Äôt know me personally would never even think to make this assumption as i am an optimistic performer. I have a very happy demeanor because I am hyperaware of emotional projection, and truly believe people do not deserve any sort of consequence to my personal misery.

I realized my depression and time do not co-exist. I have now spent over 4 years bed rotting and neglecting my physical and mental health by consuming meaningless media, eating food, chasing moments of temporary happiness. These 4 years have felt like weeks, I can‚Äôt believe the amount of time i‚Äôve spent neglecting myself.

One of the hardest things to wrap my head around is the fact that although my world has stopped, other peoples continue. I know it‚Äôs unhealthy to put yourself in a state of comparison, but it‚Äôs true. These years of my life have been crucial and I did it all wrong.

My peers are graduating college, while i got accedamically suspended at community college, now on academic probation as a first year student, when really i should be completing school.

I‚Äôm embarrassed, and my parents deeply resent me because of this. They don‚Äôt believe in the concept of mental health, my depression is nothing but an excuse to my laziness to them, I wish they knew it runs so much deeper.

I‚Äôm so tired of living like this. I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so hard for me to love myself. I feel like a burden to everyone I encounter. I am constantly reassured by others that I am a positive light (and for that I am blessed) but my brain deems it as pity, or a wrong assumption due to them truly not knowing who I am.

I don‚Äôt know how long this will last, I fear that i will continue down this path and remain stuck in my misery. What sucks is I do believe I have so much to offer and have the potential to be successful, I just don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt be kind to myself.

"i‚Äôm a 21 year old student living in london. last year i took a break from my studies because of chronic illness and horrible mental health and moved back home (i‚Äôm not from england) to stay at my mom‚Äôs house for a year while i was supposed to heal and rest. however, no resting happened, because my mom didn‚Äôt want me living under her roof without a job, and i also had to get one so i could save up money when i come back to london. so i got a full time job at a bookstore, and spent a whole year just working there, i didn‚Äôt have the energy to do anything else after work (no socialising, hobbies, proper meals, anything) and my mental health continued to decline. i spent a month at an outpatient psychiatric hospital program but my home country‚Äôs views on mental health are really outdated and i felt like it didn‚Äôt help, only made me feel guiltier/more depressed.

the year ended and i went back to uni in london. i didn‚Äôt really want to, but i also didn‚Äôt want to stay in my home country with toxic family and a super prejudiced society (i‚Äôm queer and trans, which is basically a death sentence there) so i had to go back. it was really difficult to find a part time job, and i ended up blowing through all of my savings within a few months, and just barely managed to get a part time job in time to pay rent.

that being said, how the fuck do people with depression afford to live?? i‚Äôm a full time student and work part time, and it‚Äôs exhausting me to my core. my depression just keeps getting worse every day, and the ONLY reason i still get up is because i‚Äôm terrified of being fired, not being able to afford rent and food and failing uni. i don‚Äôt remember the last time i talked to a friend or did something nice for myself or even ate a warm meal. it feels like i‚Äôm a zombie and i only have just barely enough energy to go to work and to class and then rot for the rest of the days. the thought of living like this for the rest of my life makes me sick to my stomach. i‚Äôve been depressed (along with other issues) since i was 15 and life has just been getting harder and harder every year.

i have been fired from jobs before due to mental health (and chronic illness but that‚Äôs a different issue), and i‚Äôm terrified that one day i‚Äôm going to be too depressed to get up anymore, and then i will lose my education and my job and my shitty london room. what are you supposed to do then? i can‚Äôt go back to my family because they don‚Äôt understand me and wouldn‚Äôt support me, i don‚Äôt want to end up on the streets, i have no family or support system in london. i‚Äôve seen people on here talk about not having jobs/degrees, not leaving their houses for months, so how do you afford to survive and have a home, food, etc? sorry if this comes off as mean, i‚Äôm genuinely curious because i feel so helpless like i‚Äôm barely floating above water and i will drown any second."

"Since around the age of 15-16 I spend all time indoors and didn't talk to anyone at school.
I became really anti-social, lonely, started hating myself, always had FOMO and wasted all my youth overhinking every little decision. I was always on autopilot.

I'm now 20. I work a shitty job and work out multiple times a week. I have less social anxiety than I used to have. I started to observe people more in their behaviors. And I am now realizing how nobody cares about anyone. Everyone is in their own head, living their life for themselves. That just scares me even more. I could die and nobody would even care. Humanity is brutal. I just can't stand it. Maybe I'm too weak mentaly to accept this reality. 
But yeah my life is going nowhere. I know it's technically my fault. I feel stuck but it's probably because of my ignorance. I don't know why a human would waste their life like me.

The problem is that my life on paper is practically perfect. I have a loving family, no issues with poverty and used to have a good social life. I had hobbies, aspirations, dreams and the resolve to work for them.

Idk what happened. My happiness just phased away. It became harder and harder to go out. The feeling of everything being pointless grew as my motivation and intrigue for life dissipated.

This past year I've mostly spent in my bed. Too tired to even watch TV. Most of the time I just lay here. Waiting for nothing. 

The doctors just gave me some antidepressants, hasn't been helping. I was also told I might have Me-fatigue but no following up even when I asked. 

My psychiatrist asked me why I was depressed. I answered honestly, I do not know. He said I can't be helped if I can't be honest.

Outside, my sister tells me that when they found me, I got out of bed and threw myself on the floor, I was in zombie mode. All this happening at the same time.

In the end they took me to the doctor who obviously admitted me, but I felt like it was all for nothing.

The past year is a complete blur, almost like a fever dream, and I can hardly tell you anything l've done during that time.

My mind feels completely clouded, like an empty void‚Äî I literally can't process or comprehend anything clearly anymore.

I generally believe depression has done something to my brain. When I try to read now, my eyes kind of just skim over the words without absorbing much information. It feels like my brain is constantly withdrawn and miles away from the present moment.

I miss being able to have sophisticated conversations with other people and being able to ask insightful questions, but now I can't.

"Sometimes I feel like I'm not even depressed, nor deserve to say I am because I force myself to function, if I had the choice and the luxury of being able to rot I would but I need to take care of things, I need to preserve my body by exercising, I need to make money to put food on the table, but despite how on the outside is the face of a functional adult, I feel dead inside, I feel nothing, I've reached the point of catharsis where I'm empty inside and could end it at any point if I wanted to, but at the end of the day, I feel like I don't deserve to say I'm depressed, or mentally ill."
"Just curious how a person is supposed to be happy when they have no reason to be happy. No friends, no family. No hobbies, interests or passions. No desire to pick up any hobbies, interests or passions. No desire to go out and make friends. People are assholes. No money to just ""get out of town"" for a day... no way to cure this. No kids- don't want kids. No boyfriend/husband. Men find me repulsive. No desire to be in a relationship anyway.

Just have no desire to even breathe. So how am I supposed to be ""happy""?

Yes I need therapy. I know.

No, I will not go on meds, I refuse.

Been struggling with suicide ideation since childhood. Last attempt was yesterday. Before that it was 10 years ago. I fantasize about death and dying but when it‚Äôs time to go my body fights me violently. My mind is seeking rest from the pain and I‚Äôve convinced myself death with provide that relief. But my body wants so badly to live. 

Trying to live and do normal shit after failing at death is the most difficult part of my mental Illness. 

When people ask how are you? How is your day? Anything exciting planned for the holidays? I want to reply honestly and tell them I‚Äôve survived another attempt on my life. However that is wildly inappropriate to discuss while getting ramen noodles at the grocery store so I find myself masking or shutting down hiding behind a blank stare or forced fake smile. Trying to hide this pain is all consuming right now so I find myself venting to the black void that is the internet in hopes that I won‚Äôt feel so lonely in my pain and grief. 

Tell the people you love, that you love them. I‚Äôve been masking and hiding for my entire life, you truly never know how close someone is to their breaking point. 

I‚Äôve recently lost my desire for alcohol and that scares me more than I can put into words. I am terrified to be alone with my thoughts while sober."
"I just want someone to hug me and make me feel safe and loved. Everyday, most of my energy is used on just surviving. Surviving the urge to end it all. Sometimes I feel like all I need is just a loving hug from someone who truly understands. I just want to feel someone cares. I want to be coddled. Self-holding makes me more depressed. I want to be held and be soothed like I'm a child. I want someone to care for me like I'm a child. It's difficult to explain, but sometimes I feel like I want to be held and talked to sweetly like you would do to calm a crying child. I have no friends and I am not close to my family. I only have one person in my life who has already told me to find other ways. "
"Fuck the crisis team, fuck the mental health team, fuck them all, I HAVE ASKED FOR HELP IN EVERY SINGLE WAY THAT I CAN AND STILL GET DISCHARGED.

"Almost 3 weeks ago my best friend of 8 years committed suicide, leading to me and my friends finding her bleeding on the floor. It traumatized me so much, I started having worse flashbacks as soon as I closed my eyes, picturing the exact moment of finding her laying there in the kitchen. 

She was the closest person I‚Äôve ever had. We always took each other‚Äôs side. Whenever we fought, we would find solutions together right after. So, the realization that seeing her for the last time, would be in her casket hit me hard. 

2 day ago I was in an episode and decided this was it for me. I couldn‚Äôt genuinely grasp the idea of living in this world without my only light. I put our playlist on and cut into my wrist. I was bleeding out to ‚Äú100‚Äù by Dean Blunt, which was one of our favorite songs we‚Äôd smoke to at night. At one point, after I passed out my flashbacks came into my mind. I saw her, once again on the floor, on the verge of death.
Right after, I woke up screaming and realized I‚Äôm still there in my bed, bleeding out same as her that night. Something in me got the courage to stand up. Dizzy, I barely walked to get a cloth to try and patch myself up. 

What happened gives me a lot to think about. At that moment I felt like this was her sign from Heaven that I can keep slowly, step by step going further in life with her guarding over me. Even though I won‚Äôt ever be the same as I was with her, she gave me hope that I can keep going."
"I don't want to live with kidney or liver failure, and a part of me wants to live to see the end of my manga as dumb as it sounds."
"I failed to get into medical school this year, a second time. I spent way too much energy on this, but now it is a closed door. I tried to become a doctor because my father always gave me threats that I will be a loser my whole life. 

I never really did what I wanted. I was discouraged from dating my entire life by my mother. On top of that I was told that I don‚Äôt have time to pursue my interests‚Äîhobbies.

Recently, I joined Toastmasters, as I always wanted to develop public speaking skills. Originally I received some encouragement, but today my dad said that I will never be a charismatic speaker, as nobody in our family is according to him. 

What is even the point of anything? I have had to pull through so much in life, and it seems like nothing ever paid off.

"my extended family that i haven‚Äôt seen in years came to my city for a week. idk how to interact with them. i tried to be polite but then my mom said i was too polite and too dry and so i decided to be more like i am. i have no siblings and i‚Äôve been always the weird one when i was a kid so i didn‚Äôt have much friends. 

with my friends, the ones i do have, i interact with familiar cursing and overall very dark humor but that‚Äôs because we‚Äôre like that. yet i know i can‚Äôt do that with my extended family because they‚Äôre weirdly conservative and religious but they‚Äôre family. despite i am a leftist and atheist. 

wednesday i faked an appointment because i didn‚Äôt want to drive for hours for sightseeing because i was tired and my knee hurts a lot. anyways yesterday i truly felt like everything went well. in fact, i felt like i acted like my real self. i was happy. i laughed and even interacted with one of my cousins. 

yet when i came home my mom literally started scolding me. exclaiming that i shouldn‚Äôt had said i was bored halfway through the day. i do admit i did say that but that‚Äôs because i always say it with my parents. we were in the middle of traffic and my knee was hurting pretty bad and we weren‚Äôt doing much. so i started saying random stuff which made everyone laughed and then said ‚Äúim sorry i say stupid random stuff when im bored‚Äù. well turns out it was wrong. 

then, at the end, i started being playful with my cousin. i‚Äôm 20 and he‚Äôs 24. We were flicking each other and trying to tickle each other. at some point, i decided to do as if i was gonna lick him. i used to do that with my other cousin when we were eight and i don‚Äôt know what else to do. it was all in good fun and faith. he was holding me down and i was going to lick him and he had to get and get away from me. i actually felt happy because i was making a connection. yet afterwards my mom scolded me saying that was a horrible thing to do and sexual even. so now my aunt thinks im attracted to my own cousin. 

my mom told me im already 20 so i should know what to do and not to do and what i did was horrible. she said she was horrified by the way i acted. and never thought of telling me before because normal people don‚Äôt act this way. 

this saddened me a lot. i thought i was doing good but turns out i fucked it up as i always do. i can‚Äôt be a normal person. 

i should just die. 

anyone with any insight? plz i need someone. "

It was about how we were the only two that doesn‚Äôt make him want to die and did not make fun of him or hurt him. He feels pathetic and that he doesn‚Äôt deserve anything. I know that I cannot give too much energy and I know I cannot fix him but I want to know what I should do. I validated him and gave him some insightful thoughts.

"When i was 10, i just realized how socially akward i am. I was always loner because of it. Never had friend groups, never had best friends. I was by myself most of the time and my peers actively excluded me from everything. I remember how depressed it was not fitting anywhere and i hated it so much. I gained so much weight, became a computer addict and isolated my self from the social life. I hated interacting with people because it always felt akward for me and it was never fun. People also never seemed fond of me. But feeling of loneliness made me more and more depressed while years passed. I literally isolated my self until i was 21 or something ( i lost some of my weight on the way ). Finished uni with little as possible interraction with people. Only had one friend and no girlfriend what so ever. Now i am 25, with no romantic experiance(still virgin, never even kissed), very bad social skills and few friends. I don't have any hobbies or job. I destroyed my life with isolating myself from people. Now i am far behind my peers about EVERYTHING. WTF i am gonna do. I kindda want to end my life but i dont have any courage to do it.

"I feel so unheard. I feel like an annoying burden nobody ever listens to. I'm a person nobody takes seriously    Maybe it's my fault, it's not like I've done anything that would warrant any respect. I feel like giving up completely.  You know those kind of people that get described as ""rays of sunshine"" or when they enter a room their smile lights it up. I'm probably the complete opposite. Its almost comical how pathetic I truly am. My parents know it, my sibling know it. They've told me. Maybe not using those exact words but my mom actually said ""you never amounted to anything.""

"Why do people make such a big deal about life? If you end it, you won‚Äôt be here, and you won‚Äôt suffer anymore. Why am I forced to stay?

What about those stuck in places where they don‚Äôt fit and can‚Äôt find a career?

It‚Äôs not that I want to die; I just want my existence to vanish. I believe in God, but I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life. I really want to leave my country because I feel like I don‚Äôt belong here. I can‚Äôt even find a job that I like, which makes it hard to leave.

I bought a rope several months ago and my husband made a big deal about it when he found it, so now I've been better at keeping it all to myself.

Really just fed up with the world. I don't have the strength it requires to be a man. For that reason I'll never have a family. I mean I'll never be valuable enough for a women to love me, nor am I strong enough to have children (I would like both of these at some point, I'm greedy.) Women have all the options in the world and my value is far less than many other men, even my friends. I don't blame women for choosing the best, nor do I hate them or anything like that, I'm just sad I'm not one of those men.  
I have dreams of opening a school one day, something that's better than the way our public school runs. Seems like people who are way smarter than me are already achieving that though. I like to call myself smart, but then I hear these people and I feel out done. These people will save the world, they don't need me.

It‚Äôs one of the main reasons why I‚Äôm killing myself soon I‚Äôm constantly body checking myself and especially my face to see if it got more bloated and recently I realized that it doesn‚Äôt fucking matter anyways because it‚Äôs just my face that‚Äôs ugly I genuinely would do anything to be born with pretty privilege everyday honestly I‚Äôd probably sacrifice myself in what ever way to get that. Sure money can do that but only so far. I‚Äôll never live the life I want to live and that‚Äôs the real reason why I hate living.

"When I was studying for the midterm exams, i felt disturbed and couldn't take my eyes off my father's weapon that was leaning against the wall. So I took it, pointed it at my head, and pulled the trigger. (To this day, I don't know why I did this, but I thought I might feel better if I did.) Of course it wasn't loaded, as My father almost never kept his gun loaded at home, I knew there was a chance of it being loaded, yet I still pulled the trigger. 
To this day i feel the guilt about doing such a thing especially while i was at my parents house.

I‚Äôm not seeking attention; I just felt the need to share this little story that I haven‚Äôt told anyone about."
"I‚Äôve noticed something lately being hyper-aware, constantly observing the little details of life, seems to fuel  depression and solitude. It‚Äôs like when you see too much, you start to feel too much, too. The beauty, the pain, the absurdity all of it piles up and weighs down the mind. Every small flaw becomes magnified, every moment feels stretched out, loaded with meaning that isn‚Äôt always comforting.

When you‚Äôre so tuned in, it‚Äôs hard to ignore how fleeting and fragile everything is. That awareness makes it tough to just be in the present because you‚Äôre always questioning it, analyzing it, as if you‚Äôre trying to find an answer that may not even exist. I wonder if that‚Äôs why hyper-awareness leads to sadness it doesn‚Äôt leave room for peace, for ignorance.

Ignorance is truly a bliss sometimes..

"as i sit here crying in my bed as usual, i've decided to finally reach out to someone just anyone who could possibly see or aknowledge that i'm alive and that i'm also on this planet. I feel incredibly lonely, i have no friends, i don't go to school, i don't work, i don't leave the house. No one knows i exist.

I left my home-country together with my family 3 years ago and left everything behind hoping and wishing for a better life. I didn't have the best lifestyle or a huge group of friends, but i had friends i had school and i had freedom, i had a life. I was happy. I never thought i would end up like this or spend my days taking care of my family and my younger brothers waking up to cleaning all day long to cooking and putting my brothers to sleep. My father is abusive and extremly controlling, i can't leave the house or use my phone during nights etc. the only times i'm allowed to leave the house is when i have to follow him to the grocery store to help with the groceries. I'm not allowed to have social medias or stay in my room for too long. just small details i think anyone would find normal and not weird or ""wrong"". i'm tired of being controlled, i can't decide when i want to shower or when i want to do anything on my own. i used to love art, but i have no time for it anymore. I have no time for my self and there is no point in life.

I ended up in hospital a few months ago when i cut my self pretty deep 3 times in hope that it would frighten or bring any type of attention from my parents but everything is back to normal. I still hurt and cut myself but i know i have to do it somewhere they wouldn't be able to notice otherwise i'm pretty sure they would be very mad and hurt. I used to be very good in school and had so many A's, my dream was to work as a therapist... which is kind of ironic now that i'm searching for one..

i have one friend left that i used to be friends with back in my homecountry, she is my best friend and my only hope in life even though shes depressed as well. She's been starting to go to school more and has more friends and i'm scared that she's going to leave me. She has been getting a bit more distant from me and is usually pretty quiet and busy during calls. i feel so mentally abused by my father, i'm stressed 24/7 and especially around him. I'm scared he's going to find out i have social medias or just anything that could make him get mad or physically abuse me.

I watch as other people my age goes to school, gets jobs, goes out with friends and travels around the world. I won't be able to get a job in the future, i dropped out during middle school and even if i did get a job my father wouldn't let me mostly because i'm a female. I'm too scared to take my life, i'm scared for my younger brothers and that they won't see me as they grow. i'm scared that i will make my parents embarassed and embarass my whole family. But i'm constantly thinking about it, i've tried to choke myself and find any rope or any item i could use to unalive myself. I'm not sure where i'm going with this, but i'm very serious about this and i just want to share this, if anyone even would be interested. I think i need help"

Most of the posts on here don‚Äôt even get comments. We‚Äôre pretty much all alone. The only person listening is someone you pay, and I‚Äôm broke. Even if I had the money, I wouldn‚Äôt talk to someone who needs payment to be talked to.


Sometimes you get people who do respond and want to talk privately, but they don‚Äôt understand. I guess I just say that because advice isn‚Äôt helpful unless you want to change because really the only way to change my life is to create a better one. But that‚Äôs so hard. And I‚Äôm not built for that.


Anyways, yeah. Tbh, ranting on Reddit and letting it out does more for me than even talking to people. The thought that someone has maybe seen what I said, even with no interaction it makes me feel a bit better temporarily. Probably won‚Äôt work this time but I‚Äôm going to sleep anyways so whatever.


To tomorrow üçª another awful day awaits me."
"in 3 years ive managed to build a life and watch it all fall apart again. im left with nothing. absolutely nothing. no friends, no family, no work, nothing. i cant do it anymore. i thought i had finally made it. i thought all my hard work had finally paid off. but i guess it was never meant to be, was it? i shouldve listened to the signs, i shouldve understood that all the hope i had was pointless. it felt good to live at least once, i enjoyed it. but the trauma catched up to me especially bc i still have to communicate with said trauma. ill never be able to let it go. ill never be okay. i lost too much, im too fucked up. i have no one to talk to, no one will miss me. im scared of dying, i still havent figured out how but ill have to. itll be less painful than the past 24 years have been."
"Hi, I just want to hide indoors all day and never go out and see anyone. This is a very dark and dangerous world that we live in. It‚Äôs full of cruelty and suffering. Human beings treat each other with such horrendous cruelty and contempt, and I feel like nothing and no one is to be trusted. I‚Äôve been burned too many times.

This entire world is so indescribably dark and anti-human. Everything is so profit-driven and people would gladly put you in harm‚Äôs way without hesitation if that brings them any benefit. I wish I can hide indoors all day, and stay asleep forever."
"Asking if anyone experience cognitive impairment? Is it a normal occurrence for depressed people? How worse exactly?

Side note: Usually I slept 30 mins during exam, now rather than having extra time for answering, I needed extra time. Unable to answer critical thinking questions when I used to have a lot to say on it, now speechless. If writing an essay is considered language ability, this one also depreciate a lot, used to write 2 pages easily, now, struggle after half a page to make it one full page. Anyone can relate?"
"I dont know if this is the right place to talk about this but I‚Äôm very sad and worried and hopefully I‚Äôll find what i want here. I‚Äôm f23 my sister is 16yr cut her wrist today but thankfully we were able to get her to the hospital and she‚Äôs very fine but something extremely weird happened so a little backstory my sister was caught talking to boys in an inappropriate way five years ago we live in a very strict muslim household so when my mom found out she hit her very hard she also took her phone and any electronics and when she finally returned them after 2 or three years she never stopped spying on her and sending my  younger siblings to see what‚Äôs shes doing alone in her romm and that always bothered my younger sister because she always told me that why would her younger brothers be knowing about her business and that would affect he role as an older sister and honestly i agreed with her and talked to my mom about it and we ended up agreeing that what she did was wrong and she shouldn‚Äôt send my younger siblings to spy on my sister so anyways today my mom told her to bring her phone but instead of going upstairs and taking it she sent my brother and then she was bothered that my sister changed her password (she told me why andshe had every right to change it) but my mom as usual didn‚Äôt listen and had a fight with her after a while my sister went upstairs then came back bleeding from her wrist and told my mom she accidentally hurt herself my mom did something so cruel I swear i cry every time i remember it she told her you did this mistake you fix it i was shocked and mad so i went and took her upstairs to get cleaned up, change my pjs and go to the hospital then my mom came and honestly I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôve never done that before but i screamed so loudly at her and she screamed and my sister was apologizing and crying and my fucking mom started crying and saying I‚Äôm very sick and i have your younger brothers to raise and why did you do this to me which I genuinely felt like wtf this isn‚Äôt about you and i kept telling her get your shit together this isn‚Äôt the time she‚Äôs bleeding and my mom was too scared and crying hysterically saying they could lock me up for this and blah blah blah anyways she finally got up took her and stitched her wounds im sorry for the very long story buti have read about narcissistic behaviors and she matched alot of them so if she is what do i do now im so worried about my younger sister coz she‚Äôs been literally living in hell and my mom always tell my other sister(21) to go check and spy on her and since i study abroad she‚Äôs much closer with my s21 sister so i feel like sometimes they gang up on my 16yo sister what do i doüòû also while she was screaming and saying how could you do tis to me when we were upstairs she took my sisters phone and crashed it on the floor my sister told me later that it wasn‚Äôt because there was anything on the phone and that she always did that secretly but this time she accidentally went deeper"
"I am done. I want to give up. Life is too hard. I‚Äôm really struggling with depression and I opened up to my wife last night. I completely crumbled and cried my eyes out. She gave me no physical comfort, instead she left the room and went upstairs. Later on when I asked if I should write off physical comfort in the future she replied that I should think myself lucky because she nearly got up and left the house multiple times while I was crying, so physical comfort is the least of my worries. She has told me to get therapy and look at changing my medication. I can‚Äôt keep going on like this. I just needed a big hug, not to be kept at arms length. She wouldn‚Äôt even look at me. And then just started playing games on her phone. I feel like this isn‚Äôt a normal reaction when your spouse bursts into tears and lays their emotions on the table? I feel so distant from her and never get the comfort and support I need. It is killing me. Life is just too difficult to keep persevering. I love her so much and can‚Äôt give her up so I just don‚Äôt see another option. "
"Have y'all ever thought like if people knew that they'd all be gone in 10 minutes, what would they do? Man, if I only have 10 minutes to live, I'd go confess my love to my crush, take a walk, commit cr!m3$, and anything I could think of at that time. What would y'all do?"
"I'm 26 and I spend almost every waking moment thinking about death, how I'm gonna die, when I'm gonna die, where I'm gonna die, and how I feel like I didn't enjoy my life enough I guess. I have a lot of anxiety and I'm clinically depressed and if I'm not distracting myself from the pain that comes with life then I'm thinking about this. It's been like this for as long as I can remember. And on top of all this, I'm aging. I try my hardest to not think I'm old because honestly speaking: I'm not. But it's the simple fact that I'm *getting* older that gets me. I'll be 27..then 28..then 40, if I even live that long. Will I experience life the way I want? Or will I amount to nothing? Will I be alone? Will I die alone? What if nobody attends my funeral? What if I'm so alone to the point where I don't even have one? I don't want to think like this but unfortunately I do. It's always in the back of my mind. I hate it so much because I feel like I'm literally wasting my time thinking about this. But I can't stop my thoughts. The only thing that helps is when I'm gaming because my mind is focusing on something else like at a deeper level I guess. When I'm reading I think about it, when I'm at work I think about it. When I'm eating I think about it. Even when I'm watching something sometimes I still think about all of this. Half of my family is already dead and they died when I was between the ages of 19-23. And I'm also very introverted, I try to go out or plan things with the little bit of friends I have but it's hard because I'm just not social. I can't force myself if I just don't want to. Whatever I'm doing, in the back of my mind I'm always thinking about this. 

I could even be doing laundry and I'll think morbid things like ""Wow when I die, my clothes are gonna be donated. People will be thrifting my clothes when I'm dead."" Or if I'm walking home from work ""Wow anyone can just drive next to me and kidnap me at gun point."" Grocery shopping: ""what if a shooter comes but everything I need to buy is in the back of the store!"" 


It's tiring and I'm tired."
I‚Äôm not suicidal in any way but I just don‚Äôt care about anything anymore. I‚Äôm in my early 20s but I feel like I‚Äôm 40. I just feel like I‚Äôm killing time. I do stuff but I just don‚Äôt really care. 
"I (19f) would love to just rest, in the dark, comfortable void that I get to experience everytime i go to sleep. It's so calming and safe, I hope I'll get to stay there permanently soon. "
"I feel a little silly asking, as I've known, and do know people who struggle with depression and never figured I would be diagnosed with it myself. I can honestly ""blame"" a lot of it on things happening in my life but not on not having people to talk to.

I went to the doctor to get checked up on an injury I sustained not long ago. I am all clear, by the way. But my boyfriend and brother left the room and my doc had lingered and she asked me a bunch of other questions. I've had this doc for a while now and I usually am pretty open with her but I have amdittably had a rough 4 or 5 months and she's been my doc for most of it. After our talk she said that it sounds like I am depressed and she would like to start me pm a medication. I am already in therapy twice a week for several weeks going forward due to ongoing issues at the behest of my therapist and close friends/family. Therapy has been great, and I actually started feeling more like myself for the first time in a long time but now depression?

It just feels hurtful somehow, like I took two steps forward and four steps back. Am I overthinking this?

Even now I am helping plan a surprise birthday party for a dear friend, and helping plan the wedding of two of my best friends, and things have been looking up. I feel like I have no excuse to feel this way and I haven't mentioned it to my boyfriend, friends, or family. 

How do I even begin to tackle this? I hate taking medication on my *best* day - I know it's childish but ü§∑. 

Any advice would help."
"Male 45. Long story, but I'll summarize here. I'm back working in a career I switched out of once because I was burned out. I hate my job and where I moved to for it. 

I've been put through a lot in the last ten years. Honestly, the pandemic was the happiest time. I think I've missed my chances, though, and I'm stuck in this life I hate. 

If I wasn't scared of failing, I'd have already ended it. 

I don't even know what to do besides cry. "
I want to just crawl in bed and never leave. Seeing what people online say and what people in the real world do makes me lose all hope for humanity and goodness in this world. I‚Äôm so miserable and yet I open all the apps all the time only to see some of the most horrible words I have ever seen. I go to school only to get bullied and made fun of. It all seems so pointless now. When you go outside all you see is concrete and construction‚Ä¶ I miss the lush landscape. I just can‚Äôt find a reason to enjoy my environment or life
I don‚Äôt have the energy to pretend. I‚Äôm not happy and right now I don‚Äôt care how other people see me so why pretend
I want to be held and assured everything will be okay. But I don't have anyone. Everyone gets annoyed when I'm like this. I'm gasping for air there's no one here 
"I'm tired, tired, tired, tired, so so tired. He deserves a mother who isn't pretending to be happy, who isn't sick in the head, who didn't ruin her life, who isn't thinking about ending herself while he's looking at her like she's the best thing in the world. I feel so guilty just holding him like I am going to infect him and make him miserable like me. I am a horrible mother I know... "
"I have no will left to live. My grandparents died, I lost my career due to layoffs, my mom is sick with cancer, and have no other family. Even the friends I've had for 20+ years no longer talk to me. This is just the easiest way out of my situation. There is no coming back from this. I have tried for years to better my state of mind. I have tried medications, therapists, psychologists, mental institutions, hospitals, and nothing works. I only have one option left.

I've decided to do it tonight while driving. I know the perfect spot where I probably won't be found. Hope everyone else is having an amazing life."

I am filled with rage and depression and suicidal thoughts that I just cant do anything anymore or don't feel motivated enough anymore that school and work feels like shit and money being blown like there's no tomorrow and debts piling up till im life sentence .if there's a God or magical being please fucking kill me im tired of working to get all my money gone in seconds im tired of feeling numb to every kind of pain I'm tired of waking up realizing I'm still alive please someone just kill me or help me...."
"Unemployed, each day goes by the same, I have no friends or girl friend to talk to. I'm lovesick. My trauma and intrusive thoughts are eating me up. I have thoughts of killing myself.

"Hi, I‚Äôm 21F n I don‚Äôt really want to exist anymore. I‚Äôve been depressed since 16 and haven‚Äôt gotten really much better since. I used to be a really good student, I was really smart n took 10 ap classes and graduated hs with a 3.8. But now I‚Äôm a college dropout who is too afraid to tell her mom, so I lie abt still being in it. I feel very stupid and worthless on a day to day basis. I‚Äôm unemployed n it‚Äôs my own fault. My anxiety is really bad and makes me freeze up and prevents me from making any long term progress because I‚Äôm always so afraid of failure. My emotions are so intense; If I‚Äôm not drowning in misery, I‚Äôm smoking weed to stop myself from feeling. I‚Äôve started to pick up drinking, which has pushed a lot of good friends away from me (I don‚Äôt drink too often, but when I do I usually get shitfaced). I either starve myself, or eat so much junk food that I feel fucking disgusting afterwards. Every couple days (usually after smoking) I try to turn my life around but I can‚Äôt ever stick to it. My brain feels like it‚Äôs just made wrong. Like I‚Äôm just not normal, and I won‚Äôt ever be. 

I wish for a slice of normalcy. Normal people don‚Äôt feel like this. Normal people don‚Äôt act like this. I‚Äôd trade everything just to be normal and regular. I don‚Äôt want to be me anymore. I hate me, and no matter how many times I‚Äôve tried to gaslight myself into thinking I matter, I always prove to myself that I don‚Äôt actually matter to me. I don‚Äôt want to hate myself. I really don‚Äôt want to. But it seems like no matter what I do, I still end up proving that I hate myself. 

I‚Äôm too afraid of killing myself. I‚Äôve only seriously tried once, which failed and had me placed in a mental hospital, which I don‚Äôt EVER want to go back to. But I want to stop existing. I have 3 close friends who are so kind and dear to me. My mom tries really hard to help me. My dad tries in his own way too. I don‚Äôt want them to hurt. I think the only thing that stops me from attempting anymore is because I don‚Äôt want them to find out if I fail, and thinking about them reacting to my death makes me even more miserable. I wish I could just be erased from everyone‚Äôs mind and memory and cease existence. Then, I wouldn‚Äôt be considered selfish cause I‚Äôm not hurting anyone. I don‚Äôt want to hurt anybody. 

Im not sure why I‚Äôm writing this. Probably because I feign happiness in front of everyone because ik they are probably tired of worry about me. I don‚Äôt tell anyone how I feel out loud. I just waste away slowly in my room everyday. I hate wasting away. But I‚Äôm too afraid to die. But I‚Äôm too worthless to change it. So I waste. 

I know I need help. But I don‚Äôt even have real purpose in life so what‚Äôs the point. "
"I have been on antidepressants most of my life. I don't know what ""normal"" is. My therapist recently said she thinks I need to be evaluated more often as apparently most people don't get jealous when they hear someone has died. I thought that was ok. I am not thinking of harming myself or others. Just that death might be the better option. Does anyone else feel like they don't know how to be around people because your thoughts are so much darker? I just don't know."
"Is it weird to buy a teddy bear at 29 years old? I got rid of my teddies a long time ago but my anxiety and depression have started to get really bad at night and the last few nights I‚Äôve wished I had something to hug. Would it be weird if I got myself a teddy? I know there‚Äôs no age limit to this type of thing‚Ä¶ I just feel silly üò© 

Nights are the worst for me. I struggle to sleep and that‚Äôs when my mind decides to go over my whole past and point out how I have nothing in my life‚Ä¶ no one. I cry myself to sleep most nights. I‚Äôll cry until 3/4 am and I want something to hold "
"I feel like this every day like there‚Äôs somthing wrong with me. I can‚Äôt talk to people I freeze up and I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

I have tried and tried different methods and ways of becoming concise of what is going on but I can never see it. I do have therapy but it‚Äôs not helping me anymore. 

I just don‚Äôt see light that the end of the tunnel and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I don‚Äôt have any family that is not close or not addicted to alcohol or heroin. I desperately want things to get better but they just don‚Äôt seem like they will ever. 

I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm writing this, it‚Äôs not like it will change anything. I‚Äôm not sure what to do."
"One thing I just noticed about depression is that you stop getting ready for stuff. Gotta be to work in ten minutes, I'll just wait until the last second.

I used to get ready for stuff all the time. School, sports, even church, but when you don't have all that stuff to get ready for you just sort of forget about it all. By getting ready I mean get clean cloths on making food taking a shower ect
Just wanted to let people know."
"I wish I was dead. I don't just wanna die. I am so angry and disappointed in myself, that I want to  kill myself, painfully. Why? I am a genetic disappointment. No one can seriously love me, not even my family. If I died, they'd easily replace me with someone or something superior to me. I would pay any price for happiness. If you know *anyone* or *anything* that can fix my genes, height, face, penis, etc, just say so.

Thanks."
"20M here and  I genuinely don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll make it any further.
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs karma catching up to me or I‚Äôm just overreacting but the more and more I keep going, the harder things get.

Sometimes I feel fine with death, like yeah I‚Äôm totally in. But sometimes it genuinely scares me but I know it‚Äôs inevitable.

Back in 8th grade I wanted to end my life but chickened out.
But I feel as though I probably should‚Äôve done it because ever since, it‚Äôs been a uphill battle ever since. 

Whatever I guess."
"I want to die so fucking bad, I‚Äôm a horrible peace of shit, who only makes everything worse

My boyfriend who is poly said that they wanted to ask someone else out, and I got mad at them and said if they wanna date somebody else, dump me first, and now my only friend is mad at me, saying that I fucked up, and that I‚Äôm wasting a great thing that came my way

I don‚Äôt feel anything for anything anymore, even the thought of being with my boyfriend isn‚Äôt good, it‚Äôs just not bad

It‚Äôs the middle of Easter Day, and I‚Äôm sitting in my bed feeling sorry for myself, I‚Äôm 14 and have enough money to buy a car, and overall I‚Äôm just a selfish greedy piece of motherfucking shit, that doesn‚Äôt deserve anything that I have "
"I fucked up my entire college education and didn't even know until today. I had suspicions but I didn't research anything because I was scared to know the truth but now everything is clear. No matter what I do I'm not passing. 
I will have to kill myself somewhere around February. I probably should do it now but a part of me is still hoping that somehow it will be ok. I should be happy that now I finally have just one way to go but I'm scared.
Why is it always me? Why can't someone else fuck up my life for once? Why is everyone around me so perfect?"
"I'm almost 40.  I was diagnosed as bipolar in 2018, undiagnosed in 2020, then rediagnosed in 2023.  

I feel my depression stems from, what I believe to be, undiagnosed ADHD.  I cannot focus enough to read a book, study, etc.  When I know that if I could study, I could perhaps secure a better job for myself.  Later today, I find out if I actually have it or not. 

I recently quit a good job because I felt I couldn't cut it anymore.  My better half said I should take this time to work on myself and I'm trying.

I can't accept I'm getting older and still self-sabotaging at this age, starting over each time.  I feel if I had a job I could be confident in again, then perhaps my depression wouldn't be as tough.  

Are there other 40 year olds out there feeling similar?  Or still trying to find their way?"
"I wish reddit had an anonymous posting option but oh well. I‚Äôm not looking for any sympathy, any help, any advice, I just want to say this somewhere I can; I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how to do this without hurting my closest friend but I‚Äôll probably just make them hate me or something. Family doesn‚Äôt exist for me so don‚Äôt even bring them up, don‚Äôt care if I hurt them anyway cause that‚Äôs all they‚Äôve done to me. 

In about 3 or 4 weeks, I‚Äôm gonna use my last paycheck to buy a gun and I‚Äôm shooting myself. I‚Äôve worked really hard to try and catch up with finances, I‚Äôve gotten better jobs and better jobs and second jobs and every time I feel hopeful that I can catch up on my financials my jobs are gone. I was working a shitty paying management job alongside another job that supplemented income, the second job replaced me with ai. So I left and got a better paying job before getting laid off as soon as I ready to get ahead. Then I got another job, and as soon as I was ready to get a head this month I suddenly lost half my hours. So I‚Äôm gonna talk to my boss tomorrow about it and if I don‚Äôt get my hours back, this month will be the last month I live through. That paycheck with 20 hours will cover the cost of a small handgun and I don‚Äôt need a permit. 

I just wanted to put this out there somewhere. I hope anyone who reads this can find some kind of love and light in their life because mine is snuffed out. This may also get removed idk. Idk if I care that much. 

Peace.

Edit: I didn‚Äôt get my hours back, and in the completely wrecked emotional state I was in I may have lost the job entirely. I have redecided, no longer plan on suicide. If I lost the job entirely, I‚Äôm just packing my bags and heading to the city. New home, new job opportunities. Shits rough"
"31F - I've been on a mental health leave from my job due to ptsd, anxiety, depression and adhd for almost six months. It doesn't seem I'm going to be able to go back to that job. My short term disability payments stop come December. I feel like I'm drowning. I'm applying for jobs I don't think I can handle because I have to do something for money, I'm also working on applying for SSDI which I am having issues with. I'm so scared and sad and tired. I desperately want to go to sleep and not wake up, or be a fatality in a car wreck. The biggest thing that keeps me here is my 71 yo father who is my rock and light in life. I can't do that to him, I can't possibly put him through losing me. I also very much want it all to stop. It seems I'm going to cry now, which I haven't been able to do in months. Maybe I'll feel better after that. I need a miracle.

I have a therapist and psychiatrist. We are trying to adjust my meds. I've been for inpatient multiple times. Being alive is so desperately uncomfortable. It is an ill fitting sweater long overdue from removing. I want out of my human suit. Help."

I'd rather be alone then to let them know that I've been doing absolutely nothing with myself. I am ashamed to be alive. I want to do better."

Today was a bad day. Full of self-loathing and sadness. 

I went to a local bar/record store that I frequent. They have a very small patio with two benches. I was sitting on one and a group of young couples came in and needed the space so I got up. But the sight of all these young happy people (I‚Äôm 59) sort of triggered me. So I left, and cried in my car and then when I got home. 

My kids are all grown and I don‚Äôt have many friends here to hand out with. They‚Äôre all over the country, but none of them visit me. I visit them. 

I have one friend here, really, but she‚Äôs not interested in me. In fact she has said that our age disparity (19 years) makes her uncomfortable. She prefers young people. Young men. 

Anyhow, I just wanted to say to someone I was sad today. I have no one else to tell at the moment. They‚Äôre not all this bad but it‚Äôs getting there. Yes I see a therapist. Yes I‚Äôm on antidepressants. 

Thanks for listening. "

"Please don‚Äôt try to change my mind, I‚Äôm set. Best help I can get is which way is the ‚Äú smooth ‚Äú way out. Which way should I take? Would hanging be more instantaneous then jumping? I don‚Äôt want to have second thoughts and just be quick with it. What about cutting?I‚Äôm considering taking sleeping pills before I cut. I live in a country where firearms are not allowed to I can‚Äôt shoot myself. So yeah. Thanks guys, and may ur life be smooth-sailing. "
