"My 35 yr old son died last month from complications due to diabetes and infection and I’m completely lost. I rarely sleep, I try to only cry at night and in the shower (my husband thinks I’m taking showers in the wee hours because my back hurts) so I don’t upset anyone but inside I’m dying. I stayed by his side 24/7 for the last three months of his life, only leaving him to be with my other sons as their dad (my ex husband who I remained friends with) died. Now, when I do sleep it’s just nightmares of my son’s screams of pain and death. I don’t know what to do. I just know that I have never felt so lost."
"I’m in my late twenties and I have no friends. I haven’t had many friends most my life but the isolation got pretty bad after I graduated high school and it’s only gone downhill from there. I have been somewhat trying to make friends lately but it hasn’t worked out. I feel like a creepy loser.

The friends I’ve had in the past mostly used me as a person to dump their problems on and then they would leave me. I don’t mind listening to people vent but that’s all any of my friendships have been. I’d like a friend I can watch movies with and go places with and do stereotypical friend things with everyone else seems to have experienced but me. I’m scared I’m too old now and the older I get the more pathetic it is that my life has been mostly isolation.

I’ve never dated, I’ve never had anyone pursue me and no one I’ve ever been interested in has liked me back. I’ve given up, I don’t know if I’m ugly or if it’s my personality or if I’m just invisible or what but I don’t want to be 30 and never even gone out on a single date. 

I don’t want to die alone but I realized earlier this year that I don’t know how to have connections with other people. I wasn’t ever taught. My parents isolated me as a child and I’ve always been ‘different’ (in a way that I don’t quite understand why) and I think it all stems back from that. I’d like to let go of the past and move on with my life and actually make connections with others but it feels like there’s something Wrong with me on a fundamental level that everyone else sees but me. I don’t think I’ll be able to move forward in life being as isolated as I have been my entire life.

I don’t know how to not be alone. I don’t want to be alone anymore."
"Kind of a ramble but I have something to say, trust me. 

I'm 17 (cis incase the title gave the wrong impression) and had to drop out of school due to bullying and probably have autism, my parents just refuse diagnosis. Now I'm jobless, a shut-in and have no irl friends. I'm meant to return to education in September however I'll probably drop out again ASAP.

I've missed all of those ""formative experiences"" in my teen years. I've never been able to maintain friendships and honestly do not want any anymore. I've never been to a party, didn't have any real friends until 15 (I only ended up going out with them twice and then separating myself from them a few months later). I can count the ammount of occasions I've been allowed out places alone on one hand. Also most of my school social interactions have just been receiving bullying.

Real girls are out with their friends socialising, if they have a struggle it's due to something happening in their complex social lives. They always have friends to lean on during tough times. Girls are seen as gentle and attractive to the opposite gender. 

I've never been considered attractive to anyone and look quite mannish. I don't look have any offline friends and spend most of my time online just reading fanfiction, drawing and looking at the news. I do pretty much nothing else unless my parents force me to. I yearn for the pain of a teenage breakup, to laugh at a sleepover, look good in makeup, kiss people, watch a movie with friends, be involved in some sort of stupid school drama, dress up, grow used to wearing heels, have any aspiration, not be extremely socially awkward and honestly agoraphobic. I hate teenagers and people my age as they make me feel sick and jealous, especially real girls.

I'm not just too ugly to be considered a girl but I'm too useless to be either. I wish I had a basic use like being seen as sexually attractive but I don't even have that.

I'm hardly a girl,  I'm simply female. A sick part of myself wants to be catcalled or something. Even though that's the bottom of the barrel worst female experience I feel experiencing it would improve my self image greatly. I'm that fucked up.

I just felt like sharing my perspective on ""girlhood"" (or i suppose im a woman now even though i still feel 13) I don't expect anyone to be able to help me."
"I'm 17 and female. A few months ago I dropped out of sixth form because my mother was concerned about me. I was getting picked on and wasn't being social enough, i couldn't get any work done due to inability to concerntrate and lack of any motivation. I now stay inside all day and have an addiction to shitty imageboards like 4chan, fanfiction sites, discord, and reddit. Whenever i scroll i feel like a part of my brain is wasting away yet i can't stop. I keep my curtains shut so i don't have to see what's going on outside as i might start wanting to go out or feel like i'm missing something. I have no friends irl and only interact with people online for discord game jams, fantasy anime leauge and anime discussion on imageboards. I can't even play online games with voice chat because the idea of speaking to people through audio makes me feel horribly sick and lightheaded. I spent my 17th birthday crying alone quietly because i'm one year closer to having to get up and take responsibility for things which i never want to do. I hate interacting with people who aren't my family because they all backstab you and think they know what's best for you and I have no real interest in anything they have to say. I've grown to much prefer characters and concepts because they cant change suddenly, or be snarky. I also hate the responsibility of having to speak to someone daily as it makes me feel burnt out pretty much instantly plus i struggle with giving people advice and generally understanding them. I've ended up pushing away so many people because socialisation makes me extremely exhausted. Theres no point in having friends if i grow to dislike being around them or get burnt out and can't hang out. For the good of the other person i just push them away.  
  
I hope you, the reader, are understanding how big of an issue this is for me. I'll probably be forced to return to school in september but i will certainly end up dropping out again. I don't even have any sort of job i want to do, or special talent. My routine is wake up, go online, eat lunch with my family, go online, eat dinner with my family, go online until 4am then go to bed. I'd really like to die, as i'm just spending my life sitting alone without much career purpose. If i can't find a career in future I'll just kill myself as punishment for being a leech on society.  
  
I can't go to a therapist because my mother refuses to let me do anything like that and ""doesnt want"" me ""to be that kind of person"".  
  
My main focus for now should be to go outside but it's really terrifiying. I'm worried i'll see people. Plus i live nearby a secondary school and seeing teenagers and kids makes me feel ill, especially when they're in large groups. 

I really want to leave the house but it makes me feel so scared."

Hey Warriors,

I just wanted to drop a note for all those burning the midnight oil, those feeling weary, those who might question if the journey is worth it, and especially those who trusted someone more than life itself but were let down. You're not alone, and your efforts are seen.

 **For the Strivers:** Keep pushing through those challenges. Every step forward is a victory, no matter how small. You're building something extraordinary.

**For the Weary:** It's okay to feel tired; it means you're giving your all. Take a breath, recharge, and remember that rest is as important as the hustle.

 **For the Doubters:** When the doubts creep in, remember why you started. The path may twist, but your goals are worth it. You're stronger than you know.

**For the Let Down:** Trusting someone deeply and feeling betrayed is an indescribable pain. Know that healing is a journey, and your strength is not defined by someone else's actions. It was never you. Engage and engage more, but don't let past experiences dictate your future connections. It's tough, I know, but putting trust out there again is worth it. Love extravagantly; the world needs your light.

**For the Lonely:** Loneliness can be tough, but know that many hearts out here resonate with yours. Reach out, share your journey, and let connections weave into your story.

**For Everyone:** You're crafting a unique narrative, one filled with growth, resilience, and the beauty of becoming. Embrace the journey – it's molding you into something extraordinary.

Sending each of you strength, courage, and a sprinkle of belief in your own magic. Remember, you're not just trying; you're blooming."
"I just sexted with a guy I don’t know. Everything was fine until the last video in which I came, suddenly I get the message that he screenrecorded everything. I told him how disrespectful it was and he removed his friendrequest on snap. I asked him on reddit what he was going to use the video for and he’s not answering :( I’m learning from this experience…

Thanks for your kind words everyone. For clarification, no my face wasn’t in the video. I’m not sad he has my video, I’m sad my trust was so violated. :(

UPDATE: he did answer. Told me he’s not putting it on any sites, that it’s only for his own use and that he has a problem. I then told him to delete the video and he said ‘ok’. Could of course all be a lie, but I guess I’ll take it. Nothing else I can do now."
"2 years ago, I [33F] embarked on a healing journey. 
Before that, I was a serial monogamist. After a really bad relationship, I decided to focus on myself and my friends. As a result, I’ve been abstinent, and have grown a ton. 

A couple months ago, my best friend[28F] broke up with her partner of 2.5 years. He’s great, but she was outgrowing him, and I knew it would happen. He needs to grow on his own— they both do. Selfishly, I was sort of excited that I got to spend some more time with her. She’s in school and works, so her time is limited. About a month later, she started dating again. 

Another friend[26F] I’ve spent a significant amount of time cultivating a deeper connection with has been going through some really heavy stuff. She told me two weeks ago that she was closed off from everyone. Today, she tells me she was laid up with her man— I’d never heard a word of her dating someone before that. 

I understand that people have a right to privacy. I also understand and respect that people cope with change and wounds differently. People celebrate differently. People just do things people do. It’s all good. People be peopling. I also understand I have a little more life experience than my friends do, and therefore different priorities, although they have both been through a lot and it doesn’t feel fair to measure via age. 

For my whole life, I’ve had a pattern in which I find myself just not on the same page as some of my friends, and I move on from friendships that aren’t serving me anymore. I’m so tired of that. 

I really just feel so alone in wanting to deepen my friendships. I know I need to talk to them about this. I just wish that it weren’t the societal norm to lean so heavily into romantic relationships or encounters and less on friendship. 

Edit: Please no unsolicited advice. I’ve been in therapy for years. I am my own best friend. I do an insane amount of work with myself &amp; I teach others how to do it too. If you’re in a relationship and you’re happy, then I’m happy for you. But please no projecting. I am allowed to feel this way regardless of the work I do alone or not. Friendships are important. "

Went to a wedding yesterday and it was a great day but I can't help but feel I marred things somewhat with a rude gesture I made in a photo.i wasn't actually in a single photo of the night except this one. 

It was an old friend from university and usually we'd all take photos as a group or a few nice ones here and there but we got to the end of the night and realised we hadn't taken a single one together. They had a photo booth and we went into it.  We were all pretty drunk and the groom for some reason started shouting 'hold my c*ck'. I didn't think and instantly made a gesture on his groin as if I was...... pleasuring him..

I instantly regretted it but was too late and the photo was taken. We came out and there was a guy there adding all of the photos into a photo album!

So my only contribution to the memory was that crude picture that is there for all family and friends to see! Even one of the other guys said afterwards 'that's disgusting '.

I know it's not the end of the world but it's actually really out of character for me and I'm usually a bit of a prude. I'd be really ashamed if my family saw that for example. And it was probably be shared or seen by lots of people.


I'm just really ashamed and regretful that I would do that in a photo of such a special occasion. "
"I’m trying to not cry as I type this but I feel like a complete and utter failure in life at this stage. I have no friends. Nobody. I did before but they moved and I moved to a different city. We drifted apart. 

I tried making friends here, I really did. But it’s so, so difficult to meet my people here. I feel a disconnect all the time. It’s worse when I crave adventures and feeling alive. I see amazing events so often and my heart aches to go have the time of my life but I have absolutely nobody to go with. These could have been incredible experiences but instead they all turned out to be the saddest disappointment because of how lonely and how much of a loser they made me feel. I tried going alone before but it felt so bad and lonely and it’s just not for me. 

You don’t understand how much I want a go to person or persons to call when I hear about that great band touring. How much I just want to feel anticipation and excitement instead of shame and sadness when I see that amazing opportunity. How much I just want my people to hop on these experiences with me that easily. 

I’m so tired and sad of feeling this way. But I don’t know what to do. I just miss having company to make memories with so much. It’s been too long since I’ve been happy. "
I just turned 40 and I have no friends. I started a new hobby ballroom dancing 7 months ago as one way to try to meet some new friends. About 6 weeks ago I mentioned the class to someone who just moved to the area and they started too. This weekend one of the regulars had a party and I just found out pretty much everyone including the new person who started the class only 6 weeks ago was invited and went. This was one of many things I tried over the last year and I still don’t have any friends. I genuinely don’t know how to connect with people and make them like and include me. 
"Hey, all you beautiful people. Right now, I'm feeling very sad and lonely at the moment.

This may sound cliche, but I don't have much friends. I looked at myself several times, and questioned why no one would want me, I care so much about the feelings of others, and I comfort people, even people here on Reddit, people I barely even know, but I still help them, because I can't just watch someone suffer and do nothing.

I blame my friendlessness on me being an introvert, and as much as I can be introverted, it really hurts me that I can't make connections with others. Last night, I was crying over this, and over the times where people have hurt me. I even just wanted a hug, and I still do. 

I'm feeling very alone right now, and I feel like I won't be having friends because there's not many people in my generation that are like me, kind and compassionate, even if there are good people in my age group, I don't know where or how to find them.

I came here because this sub is like an online home to me, a place where I show love and kindness to others, and I hope that it's shown to me as well. 

I appreciate any kindness shown to me, it's really what I need right now. Thank you for reading."
"All the memories are coming back and I’m just really hurting. Part of me is relieved it didn’t work and the other part wishes I had succeeded. I’m reflecting on everything that has happened since then— the pain, the grief, the other attempts. And there’s also the good moments, which is creating this bittersweetness that I can almost taste on my tongue. I honestly don’t quite understand these feelings. Would really appreciate some kind words, because although I don’t know what exactly I feel, it’s not a good feeling at all. It’s making me sick to my stomach.

"Hello, I'm currently in my 20's, yet I'm still a kid in my dad's eyes.

I'm what one would call Book Smart, yet lacking in Street Smarts/Common Sense. So it's very depressing to see me end up being scolded again and again, being called stupid and moronic, to the point I close myself off to them, which would restart the cycle.

I'm not a good kid, I'm lazy, clumsy and forgetful. But I am trying to change who I am, but lack of common sense, and the shutting off communication of my parents is a large dent to that plan.

Especially my dad, who sees me with indifference.

I guess what I am asking, is how to prove my parents that I am as smart  as my report card tells them, in chores and outside academia in general?

" Hello to all the Kind Voices out there,

I am aware it’s rare we make a post regarding the sub because in general you are all a great bunch and aside from banning spammers and the odd troll, we don’t get much trouble. However I do want to pick up on some recent feedback we have had both here and in the discord and advise people to be careful on promises of friendship and long term support.

This is not in response to any particular individual, but I just want to put an advisory out there to all our offerers to be careful with how they commit to lookers. Kind Voice was always intended to give troubled souls a place to find someone to listen to them and have a safe space to be able to say what’s on their mind. More often than not this is a short term interaction, when someone is in a bad spot it can be very easy to offer long term support without realising the expectation this places on you as an offerer, and the potential for let down on the side of the person who is looking. The last thing you want in a bad spot is another person to leave you hanging, please be mindful of your own mental bandwidth when offering long term support. There is nothing wrong with knowing your own limits and being a temporary shoulder for someone to lean on, you are already doing an amazing thing by offering your time to help a stranger.

To all of our looking members, I really hope you have found some help in Kind Voice, but please remember everyone here is volunteering their time and be mindful of their boundaries as they should be mindful of yours. Again there is also nothing wrong with setting your expectations of what you are after up front to avoid any confusion! You can always post again if you need another Kind Voice.

Thank you for all your participation and remember to look after yourselves where you can.

&amp;#x200B;

* AJ and the team at Kind Voice"
"As the title says. We'd been close friends before dating for about a decade prior to the relationship, so I was pretty sure I would be with her the rest of my life. I won't lie our relationship had been rocky for this past month for many reasons, but I'm devastated as I never thought she would do this to me. We had gotten into a fight about a co-worker of hers hitting on her, and I had asked for some space because I was uncomfortable with how she had been handling it. Well we talked again today, and she admitted to me that they slept together the next day after we had the argument (Probably many more times than that. I don't trust her at all anymore). I know its pretty lame, but I broke down in front of her shaking and in tears. 

We ended up talking for a long time and I left... only to return to her place an hour later because I'm weak and I wanted to be next to her even if she had just destroyed all my self esteem. Well, she wasn't home either. 

Anyways, I'm probably at the lowest point I have ever been in my life, so if anyone has had any similar experiences or methods of coping with something this fucked up let me know. I probably wont be sleeping for a while....

I have a genetics disorder you can’t tell I have it but I feel like no woman will love me because of it and I I feel like I look creepy. It hurts. It makes me cry. I feel like I’ll only be happy in a relationship
"I’m well-liked everywhere I go, I am called handsome a lot, I have a very nice body, I’m sweet, funny, etc. but I haven’t had a girlfriend before. I’ve kissed at least, but relationship-speaking, I’ve never been in a relationship and it’s soul-crushing.

Was diagnosed with high functioning autism many months ago and it destroyed me as soon as my doctor gave me the bad news, much more than I thought it would. I always knew I was somewhere on the spectrum, but still, this shit fucking sucks, realizing you don’t fit in with most of society.

I just want love."
"I’ve been contemplating it because I’m 22(f) and well, I’ve always only been used for sex and no man ever wanted to get to know me beyond my body. I kinda feel like it would be better off to die. Ever since I was small I’ve always been cornered and bullied. It took me to try twice as hard to make the friends I have today, but even then it feels like it’s not enough. None of my relationships lasted and they didn’t make an effort to get to know me but just sweet talk themselves into wanting to have sex with me. (No one has ever said that they love me either) I feel like it would be better off to die instead? because what’s the point in living in this body if men only want me for sex? What’s the point in living if this is my life? I can be at peace when I’m not here anymore. When i’m not living. No one wants me anyways. No one wants to love me. It’s so hard to navigate and make people like you. "
"after being told all through school that i may have autism, having teachers assume i have it without asking much and now in sixth form college have been told to go see a gp about getting a diagnosis i really hope i dont fucking have it because that will be the last straw.  
  
i probably do and thats the worst part. and i refuse to be a autism acceptance activist type because that's cringy as fuck. i refuse. there is no good that could come from this and i dont want to live in delusion.  
  
my mother on the drive home from seeing the GP today and getting a list of phone numbers gave me a speech about how ""being labelled is a bad thing because people will bully me even more"" and i get what she means and have to agree.  
  
if i get any diagnosis it confirms that i cant make my life better. I dont go outside unless i have to, dont speak to anyone and spend all day online, there is genuinely no hope for me, i have no aspirations and if it turns out im disabled that just solidifies my uselessness to society.  
  
fuck my life.  
  
if i actually get a diagnosis i will end my life.

could i have some nice words. i feel so fucking horrible right now,"

"I (36F) went to work today, despite having a painful sinus infection. My husband (36M), who has been searching for work for almost a year now, stayed at home and did a couple of chores. 

I came home and felt too sick to cook, so I ordered KFC for both of us (very healthy choice, I know - I just needed some comfort food). I told him that I was ordering one box of ten crispy strips (because it just seems reasonable that one person would be able to eat five strips, not ten in one sitting), but he somehow infered that I ordered one box per person. 

When the food arrived, he went downstairs to get it and tripped on his way back up and spilled some of the coleslaw on our neighbors' floor mat. I was lying down in bed at this point and distantly heard some commotion, but I then heard him coming up the stairs and thought he must have just dropped something. 

He dumped the food on the table and refused to eat with me, because I had ordered one bucket instead of two and because I didn't come to his aid after he had tripped. I immediately ordered another bucket, as well as the replacement coleslaw for the one he'd spilled and I apologized for not having realized that he'd tripped. 

He still refused to eat with me and called me a bitch and other names and continued to shout at me for at least 10-15 minutes as I ate. 

This is by far not the first time this has happened. 

I have no one to tell this to and I just want a hug. "

"I'm a junior college student and I feel so negative and stressed all the time about the future. I'm not sure if I'm even gonna pass my exams to get through to next year, but even if I do I'm terrified of how I'm going to get a job that can support me. I can't even get initial responses for internships at small companies, and I feel like I'm unprepared for the reality of life.  
  
My parents always told me not to waste my potential and study hard or I'll end up on the streets since I was in elementary school, and I think that mentality ingrained in me has begun to make me very anxious as of college. I've gone from being the absolute best in high school and getting into one of the world's best universities to now barely scraping by and just studying for shit grades with no friends since freshman year, and my maladaptive daydreaming habits have gotten worse and gotten very destructive compared to in high school as I get more and more stressed.  
  
I feel like I'm way too soft. When my parents randomly yell at me from time to time (to drill into me that I need to study hard usually) I get on the verge of tears, I get so anxious about failing that I can barely focus on studying, I'm socially anxious to the point where I can barely commit to student societies that I wanted to do for my CV.  
  
How do I ""toughen up""? I feel like my mindset in life is so negative, and I feel like everyone is against me for no reason. I feel like every day I'm on the verge of giving up and I have to push so hard just to get some studying done and fight the anxiety or depression I feel (idk if I'm actually ""depressed"" clinically, I think it might just be that my life is objectively bad rn).  
  
My goal in life is just to get a stable career in something that allows me to afford a place to live, bills, food for myself with a decent work-life balance so I can build some hobbies on the weekends/days off. I don't feel like I currently have the capability to do that with all my anxiety, whether or not I get my degree. Right now I have exams 3-4 weeks away that I need to focus on but after that I wanna know what I can do to ""toughen up"" and become someone who can be confident that they can make a living and survive in this world."
"After being unemployed and depressed for 2 years I recently started an online business. I made my first sale and asked for some advice on a subreddit and for some reason loads of people got very upset and angry by my lack of experience. They started saying things like I’m the reason buyers dislike online sellers, my customer service is irritating and annoying, calling me a dumb ass, and some were even wishing that my business fails. 😞

To make things worse, when someone commented with helpful advice in a kind tone, and tried to defend me, they got downvoted by loads of people. I replied to them saying thank you for your kindness &amp; I got downvoted by 50 people which made me feel SO disliked! 😭😭

I have childhood trauma of being bullied by several people, so this has really rattled me and I’m feeling really sad.

My husband has struggled with mental illness as long as I've known him. I've been along for the ride for 24 years. His psych doc just made some meds adjustments that went bad. This is the first time he's been held in-hospital and I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around it. I'm just at home with the dogs trying to go on with things but what I really want is just a normal life where everyday isn't coloured by mental illness hanging over our heads. 
"I’ve been feeling really depressed lately - one of my worst episodes in over a year. It’s been hitting hard.

When I feel really down one of the mantras I try to follow is “do something.” Basically, if I have the urge to do something, I do it, even if it’s a little weird or out of my usual routine (provided it’s not harmful to myself or others, obv).

Do I want to stop by the side of the road and look at that tree? You betcha. Wanna drive out of town and chase some interesting clouds? Sure. Wanna sleep on my back porch in the middle of winter? Why? Who knows, but my sleeping bag is rated for 15F so why the hell not.

When I’m depressed I figure any sign of wanting to do a thing is worth celebrating. So even if the thing is odd, I do the thing.

Today’s thing was making something. After almost a month of worsening depression and some really really bad moments, I wanted to *do* something. I wanted to *make* something. So I did, and I was feeling pretty good about it so I decided to share it.

And a asshole on the internet said something really unkind about what I made.

It’s the internet. I know what it’s like. I’ve lived here for years. And if I was doing better, it wouldn’t throw me at all. But now I’m back to feeling low and sad and I’m so tired of feeling this way.

I wish that person had decided to be kind instead. So I’m gonna take this as an opportunity to do a thing and I’m going to be kind.

I hope you all have a good day - or at least a better day than you had yesterday. I hope you see something that makes you smile.

You are worthy of kindness and compassion, and you are doing the best you can right now. And if your best *right now* isn’t where you’d like to be, that’s okay. You are okay.

"Hey everyone. I really feel down right now, lonely, and I need a kind person here with me. I'm sorry if this sounds like a rant.

I've already made multiple posts on this sub about my loneliness, and I am thankful for all the support you have all shown me, but I feel like I want to talk more about my pain.

Right now, I feel alone. For as long as I can remember, I've had no one to call a friend. To this day, I'm not part of any friend group, and I've faced only rejection. People don't want me, and it's been proven to me. When I was 15, I was once in a friendship that I thought was a true friendship, but things happened that made me question the friendship, which led to conflict to that friend, which ended in me receiving death threats.

As of now, I've wished for a friend, I wish I could feel welcome in a friend group, I wish I was understood and loved, but sadly I grow up with a cruel generation of people.

I've been so kind to people, I've helped people on this sub out of the genuine warmth I had in my heart, but I wish someone could be there for me. I'm sorry if this gives you a bad impression of me, but I just feel sad right now. If I made this post on r/teenagers, I'd be harassed like I've never been before, despite the good I did for others on there.

I'm just feeling down now because I'm saddened that I haven't had a successful social life compared to my step-siblings. They have people who care about them, value them, everything, and I've only had a deal with false people who only pretended to care, I've never been lucky, and I blame it on my introverted and shy personality as well as my past, as my parents split up when I was 8, which still affects me.

I'm sorry for venting, I just wish I had someone to turn to, I wish someone could sit next to me and tell me that everything will be alright, I just need a hug. I just want to feel loved.

Thank you for reading, I hope you understand."
"Hey everyone. I think I was in an abusive relationship. I'm thankfully out, but the relationship haunts me. And I find it hard to open up about it with people without feeling like I'm just bothering them.

There's a lot that happened, a lot I can't even outwardly admit happened. It had destroyed my confidence, my own idea of self.

To this day I am scared, in the back of my mind. I'm pretty sure she has saved my nudes. Idk. Maybe I'll end up on some revenge porn site or something. 

I don't know man. It's just really hard. She once told me that she liked to hurt me so I could feel how she feels.

She was a very hurt person, and couldn't empathise with others well. I think she may have been a narcissist. But I don't know. "
5 years ago I was a guy who did not care at all about anything after developing panic disorder and anxiety disorder (almost 100% recovered) I developed a habit to rant how hard is it for me to keep living like this. 2 years ago I developed ibs that makes your quality of life miserable and hard and I find myself constantly ranting how hard it is for me to keep going. I need advice on what to do to brake this horrible habit. Yes my life is extremely hard for me but it's not as hard to rant almost daily and spiral in rage how unfair it is. Please I need advice 😞 
I turned 23 today and I didn’t have a single real friend to celebrate with. I know that I don’t have a lot of friends and I guess I don’t make a huge effort to make any. I just feel so anxious in social settings and to exhausted to go out and make the effort. I feel like something must me wrong with me. 
"Thank goodness people interrupted it and he's okay. But I don't even know how to process any of this. Just really heartbroken and scared. I'm barely keeping my own shit together these days, I don't know how to handle this."
"it’s so fucking childish i know. it’s not something i want to think about or like to think about, but there’s some part of my brain that hyper fixates on the fact that i haven’t been any “firsts” for him

i’m 21 and he’s 20. his past relationships were all in highschool, and we’re long distance, so i know we couldn’t haven’t met in highschool,  but my brain overthinks in ways i cannot fucking explain

he’s had 2 actual relationships that he said weren’t healthy and he doesn’t talk to them or think about them. he dated a girl for one day but they broke up, so he doesn’t count that, and he also had a fling but he said it didn’t last long because flings aren’t who he is 

but my fucking monkey brain thinks like this, “you’re his 3rd relationship. technically you’re his 4th and you’re the 4th person he’s been with sexually.” it is absolutely toxic, but i physically can’t stop myself from thinking that

i have never had a boyfriend before and im a virgin. i feel very insignificant though because, he’s going to be all of my firsts and i won’t be any of his. i’m not his first relationship, im not the first person he’s been in love with or said “i love you” too, im not anything

being a first is not that big of a deal, but it just makes me feel like i mean something to him. i want to feel like i have a meaning

sometimes it gets really overwhelming and i zero in on the fact that im not even the second person. 

how can i stop thinking like this? it’s genuinely starting to make me feel sick and i don’t want to be like this anymore "
title. I’m 22[f] and have only been used for sex. No one ever wanted to get to know me. I just want to know if any of you have ever been in my shoes and found love. I want some hope. 
"I’ve had a rough couple days. So for starters I’m a trans girl, and I’ve been dealing with the worst dysphoria. I just feel hideous. Like itll never be better or okay, my entire life has been 19 years of a nightmare. I hate myself for being here, being a friend, being a child to someone, just everything, No Love. I feel so alone, I’m also on the autism spectrum so it makes me being emotional really hard, I never express my feelings and when I do I get shit for it. I posted on off my chest and got met with no support. I guess. I just wish I could be born a woman or something, start over again, do everything over again same friends and life but as a real girl. I guess life was never meant to be good for me."
"I cry about it so much. I deal with a lot of self hatred/mistreatment because I'm really unattractive but usually people don't make it THAT obvious, but this boy I used to work with would body shame me a lot, commented on my flat chest/small butt, made jokes about my body/his body being ""better"" than mine (as in his pecs were bigger) and he called me ""underdeveloped"" and I haven't been able to get that word out of my head, it really hurts

It's so accurate.. I don't look like a woman at all. It's just more confirmation that boys think I'm ugly and don't like me. It just hurts so much and I'm so sad over it"

"I created a proposal with a team and presented it to our executive team today. They seemed to think our proposal was not needed, but only because they are not tasked with the daily work that builds up because we don’t have what is proposed. I tried to ground it in my own experience and the President cautioned us not to conflate our personal experiences to that of our clients. I just felt misunderstood, rejected, and chastised… which I often continue on my own after the meeting.

Just looking for kindness."

"I have struggled with a lot of mental health stuff for my whole life.
I am currently on meds and attending to therapy weekly (I have been for almost a year, and I have also been in therapy many times before..) and I still have bad days, weeks, months. Life is hell.

People say 'take care of your mental health' like it's a choice.
Sure, some people can get burned out from working too much and not listening to their bodies, which is a serious problem and in that case people could maybe help themselves get better....

But it doesn't always work that way and by hearing people say it as if it does, I feel like a failure for not being able to get better.

Sorry if that came out too angry, I am pretty low rn"
"It does not matter what you have done in your life, you are worthy.

It does not matter what others perceive you as, you are worthy.

Bad relationship? Sorry, still worthy.

Skeletons in the closet? Uh, worthy. Yep.

Lonely and isolated equals worthy.

Regrets don't make you unworthy.

In fact, even if you have done things that you consider disgraceful, the fact that it's a regret is screaming in your face how worthy you are.

You simply cannot take away your worth.

Each day is an opportunity to become a more authentic expression of your truest sense of self and it is impossible for you lose that.

Now in the meantime, you might not feel that way about yourself, because your worth is there for you to discover.

You can take your time.

But eventually you will see that you were worthy all along and it was just your environment that shaped your perception of yourself negatively.

Whoever you are, you are loved."
"I’ll be 23 in 16 days actually. 
I’m being sued for probably thousands of dollars. I don’t have a car anymore. I was so close to finally moving out of my abusive home. Once they find out about me being sued it’s going to go really really bad for me. I’ve never been so scared in my life. I was already depressed and suicidal to begin with. If this lawsuit goes into effect (it will) I’m really going to remove myself from existence. I lost everything. I was finally in a good mental headspace and this happens. I’m so fucked. I’m so done. My life is over. "
"(15 M)
So here it is, my dad who has a crippling alochol addiction. Probably been drinking his entire life. 

Due to some misjudgement/ misconception he was drinking a lot during the past 2-3 years. It was daily, sometimes one, sometimes two and sometimes even three bottles of 180ml of whiskey. 

Fast-forward to now, he had jaundice for which we took him to the hospital for checkup, he was kept there for 2 days then was shifted to a better hospital where he's being kept for 4 days now.

Doctors concluded that he has major Liver Cirrhosis with 80%+ of his liver not working at all. ""It has rotten"" - the doctor said. Currently he's being injected with plasma and requires a liver transplant. 

Our family is not a rich one, and the transplants is gonna probably cost a lot with very slim chances of survival. 

I love him, even if he was not in the best shape these past years. He did so much for me that I am only realising now. I lost my grandfather in 2017 and I am not sure if I am ready for another loss. I am trying to brace my self but find it difficult. I am not crying but I want to. I just know that there's very less chance of survival with his condition and I am in shock and agony. 

I don't want him to go, but what if he does? What will I do? I didnt want to say this but I am only 15, what am I supposed to do? I am aspiring to be a student of a prestigious college, if I break I will get no where, I am the eldest child so my younger siblings don't know and its hard to keep a smiling face.

I am trying to be hopeful but his condition says otherwise. 

Anyways enough with my yapping, thanks for reading all the way through.

"I once heard somewhere, that there is infinite amount of people who could have been born and somehow YOU made it here. So what, if everyone doesn’t understand you or if they can’t see how awesome you are! Make sure when YOU look in the mirror you like that person who is looking back at you. "
"My name is Yamen Nashwan, and my family and I are currently living in a small tent in Rafah after being displaced for the fifth time. Our lives have become a daily battle for survival. 

Finding food has become nearly impossible. We’ve lost our home, our jobs, and every bit of savings was spent on our latest displacement and setting up this fragile tent. We often go to bed hungry, not knowing if we’ll have anything to eat the next day.
 
Getting clean water is a constant struggle. I spend hours standing in long lines, just to fill a few containers with water that’s barely safe to drink. The fear of airstrikes is always with us, making this simple task even more dangerous. 

My father, who was severely injured during our escape, and my mother, who is also ill, need medications we simply can’t afford. Prices are sky-high, and medicines are scarce.
Despite spending everything we had, it’s still not enough to care for them.

All of this happens while bombings and gunfire continue around us. Each night, we lie awake, terrified that the next explosion will be our last. The fear of death is a constant reality here."
"My name is Yamen Nashwan, and I used to live in a beautiful four-story house in Beit Hanoun, Gaza. My life was full of promise—I had a job, dreams for the future, and a close-knit group of friends and family. But all of that was taken away from me when the conflict erupted.

The place I once called home is now just a memory. My family and I were forced to flee, and now we’re living in a small tent in Rafah City. There are 27 of us crammed into this tiny space, including 13 children and a newborn. Every day, we struggle to find food, warmth, and safety. Loved ones.

The dreams I had for the future now feel like distant memories, overshadowed by the daily fight for survival. My friends, my community—so many have been scattered, displaced, or worse. The laughter and joy that once filled my life have been replaced by fear and uncertainty.

The hardest part is the loss of the intangible things—the memories of better times, the bonds with friends and neighbors, and the sense of security that came from knowing we had a home. These things can never be replaced.

Life in Gaza is not just a struggle for survival—it’s a constant reminder of what we’ve lost. I wanted to shed light on the harsh reality we face every day. It’s a life filled with pain, but also with a small, flickering hope that one day, things might change."
" I do not know if this post will be relevant to this subreddit, but I don’t want the attention of people on other social media who know me, or to know what’s happened to me. So I come here, instead.

Yesterday I was in my first car crash, and hopefully my last one. God had his hand on me, for whatever reason surely, as death tried his dance with me for the second time in a year and a half. Three, in total. It seems he wants my company and for whatever reason God keeps denying it, thankfully. 

My soul feels like it’s still in the passenger seat, careening around and around until I can catch my own head and make sense of it all. I can still feel the hot pavement underneath my hands and arms and against my cheek after crawling out through broken metal of the passenger seat. I have…I have never known such a horror to rack my body in such a way. I crawled and crawled, I tried to call for my best friend, whose screams I will never forget. I don’t remember if I was put on my back or rolled, but I had never been swarmed with so many people so suddenly in my life. I’m beyond thankful for the people and emergency personnel who prayed over me.
My heart broke in the ambulance, and all I could do was cry out to God and apologize. I wasn’t the driver, and yet I feel guilty. My best friend was seriously injured, a result due to the other driver speeding and cutting cars to make his green light. 

I’ll never forget him leaving his car, cursing at me, kicking the glass while I gasped for breath on the ground. He told hospital staff it was all our fault, but he denied medical attention at first. All I could gasp out was “I wasn’t driving, I wasn’t driving!” Before a million faces hovered over me. The man hit us so fast I didn’t have a chance to see anything above the grill of his car. All I saw was silver and white. I can’t….i can’t let go of the colors. The smell. Everything. My parents tell me I’m wallowing and should stop crying and be thankful. I am thankful. 

But I still feel like I’m in the car. I can’t get out. I’m both crushed between the metal and crawling on the pavement. The heat of the concrete still stings me. The man is still yelling at me. My best friend’s screams fucking haunt me. I can’t get out. I don’t know how. "

"Hello there, all you wonderful people. I want to talk about something that's been bothering me for so long.

Often times, I feel like I'm not as good of a person as I think I am. I do indeed show compassion and love to people, even here on Reddit. I've been helping others, telling them they're not going to be alone, and letting them know that they're loved. I would show kindness to people I barely even know, however, I feel like I'm not that good of a person, but I try my absolute best when met with someone who needs love.

I have anger issues, and whenever I do so, I end up having a breakdown later, feeling like I have become a person I'm not. I really don't know if I can call myself good or not. I'm kind, but I have a bad temper."
"I stopped going to school in August 2021 because of sheer laziness that I blamed on mild anxiety, I spent the rest of 2021 on discord talking to people older than me and playing vidya. 2022 I started to realise how badly I fucked up my life, I decided to delete discord yet since then I've still been on and off using it. I got a psychologist assigned to me but only went once or twice yet again of sheer laziness that I blamed on mild anxiety. This year has been one of the most miserable of my life, Especially the last 3 days. I'm realising how fucking sad my life has become. I have no friends, Never had a relationship in my life, All I do is stay in my room all day browsing the internet, researching pointless things. Its especially bad now since I turn 16 next year which means I can get a job, But I have no qualifications, I've never even taken a GSCE test. I want help. The constant staying indoors has gave me horrible anxiety and its all my fault. My school has tried to help me, But I haven't even tried to let them help me. And even when I have gone into school over the past year I just sit in the teacher's lounge staring off into space for a couple hours, And then I go home.

"I have a horrific life. Even the friends I try to make can't help telling me how they'd end it if they were me, how grateful they are not to be as sick and disabled as I am, or they defend and devil's advocate for society and the people who harm and hurt me because of my disabilities. Make excuses for them instead of validating the harm and how I feel.

I know they have good intentions sometimes but they ultimately just can't handle or relate to what I'm going through and it's how they express that. 

I feel so alone and misunderstood on top of my severe chronic pain (and the mental illness that accompanies that). I've lost almost everything and everyone. Even my online partner dumped me, got sick of me after a few months. And there's life crisis after life crisis. The breakup, an emergency move, death in the family, estate drama, pests in the house, nonstop medical crises piling up. Just this year.

The partner/ex I live with is unsupportive emotionally, lashes out at me. I help them with everything and they treat me like shit and I can't leave and have nowhere to go. I'm totally dependent and my family is even worse to me. Even my friends tell me I'm hopeless. Someone said they feel hopeless but said at least they could get better but I truly am hopeless. And it hurt because they're right.

I will never get better, only worse. I live in physical agony and that will only keep getting worse. I'm homebound. All I have are memories of the things I can't do anymore, the places I'll never go again, things I'll never do.

And my attempts to make new online connections all go wrong. No one knows how to talk to me. I just want them to treat me normally, like a friend, like someone going through hard things. They'd never say things like this to someone going through a loss or depression. I don't know why disability makes people's brains turn off and be insensitive, victim blaming, invalidating. Yeah ""they don't know better"" but it's really not that hard to be a little empathetic.

No one wants to be around me. No one truly cares about me. That's the hardest thing. I try to find people to care about, reasons to keep going but everyone pulls away or pushes me away. Maybe I can't blame them. I try to be a good friend, try to be supportive and kind, but it doesn't matter. I'm hopeless. And no one wants to be around that. Around me.

I doubt anyone here will want to either but on the off chance you do and have the ability to hold space for this, feel free to message. I'm actually a good support and listener myself, I usually don't get the chance but I can offer that too. If I don't reply right away, it's because I'm having a hard moment and taking some space but will respond when I can."

"A number being, just one in the population count of your town/country/city/whatever. I grew up in a rather... turbulent environment. My parents divorced when I was around 6-7 and had to go back and forth between them. A mother who was too tired to keep up with all of her four children + two step children and a father who didn't care at all if I existed or not unless I did something bad. Or in our words ""bursting his bubble"".

At school I had a few friends... for awhile until something arbitrary happened and they just didn't want to be my friends anymore. I still remember how I sat down next of my best friend at lunch and she just looked at me angry and left the table taking the whole friend group with her. I never got to know why that happened and was managing it fairly well. I did manage to get a new friend when I reached our equivalent of high school. But after an outing with the class she refused to be my friend because I didn't tell ""my teacher"" about a thing that happened that putting. Long story short, she broke a rule and got scolded by my homeroom teacher and for some reason it was my responsibility and ever since then she no longer wanted to be my friend.

I've had a real hard time getting friends growing up since then. I believe the last time I had and Real Life friends were like 14? I've grown up rather isolated. My family doesn't care if I exist even though my mom keep telling me that she loves me and I broke contact with my dad when I was around 16 since he absolutely didn't care about me.

Now I sit here at age 33 about to turn 34 this August and... yeah. I don't know. At least I'm happy that I managed to get diagnosed for autism in my young adult life and am able to live a comfortable life due to the minor economical stability it gives me. But... sometimes the loneliness gets too much and you feel so isolated from everyone. I feel like I've been living alone for most of my life. I still remember 2020 when everyone panicked about being isolated from the world and I felt ""Now you know how I feel..."".

I have a few friends online... that I rarely talk with. I do have a dnd group I talk with online each Sunday so that's something and I'm happy for that social communication but... when it comes to general daily life... I have nobody. None and I don't even know why I'm writing this whole post I just wanted... I guess... to have it out there? Somewhere?

I'm sorry if you read this far and all I just... I don't know. Just wanted to vent somewhere and unleash the sadness I have today... Thank you for listening or reading rather."

Think about how happy and comfortable you will sleep at night even if it’s a small task. You don’t have to clean everything spotless in one day. Take your time as long as you’re cleaning up.

I’m not just writing this post to you guys so keep in mind that I’m still work on and overcoming a lot of myself day to day."
"Hi….as the title indicates, and I’ve posted a few times and this is just to vent….I am in a very dark place with depression to the point that I can’t stop drinking. I am an alcoholic, I depend on alcohol to make me feel good and to forget about the world for a while. But once the alcohol is gone, I feel the pain, and depression and anxiety….it sucks so bad! I am very suicidal at 3 in the morning and I have plans….plans to take my life….the pain, the depression, the trauma and anxiety has gotten out of control. All I really need is a friend right now, someone to call, someone who can be there and not care about what I go through and just be a friend and not someone who constantly blocks me. It hurts so bad! Is anyone awake enough to voice message or at least send voice notes through discord?"
"The truth is, I genuinely want to k*** myself. 

It gotten to a point where I’m tired of fighting. I’m tired of trying to find solutions, I’m tired of trying to hurdle over my mind. The honest truth is, I don’t have the balls to even try. Everyday I look for hope within myself but I can barely find it. I do my best to give others hope that I don’t have, but I really don’t know how to do the same for me. I don’t even know where I was going typing this. I know it seems like I’m being overdramatic but this is my true and current state. 

I need help, but I simultaneously don’t want to bother anywhere because, I’m just tired"
Just need to talk to someone. I am just so lonely and heartbroken I don’t even know what to do. Have you ever gone to a point where you can’t cry because you are too broken?

"Hi! Everything that could have gone wrong in my life has gone wrong. My husband cheated on me, I lost my job that meant so much to me, one of my friends is no longer with us, I was applying for Masters and it’s not working out, and all my friends cut me off (some my fault, some not). 
The past few weeks have been so so difficult and I’ve slowly found myself getting sicker and sicker. I can’t sleep for longer than 25 mins at a time, I haven’t eaten anything in days, and the anxiety is turning into physical pain in my chest. 
Can somebody give me some hope that it’ll get better? I really need kind words right now. Thank you for taking the time. "
"I need somebody to talk to. A lot of things are happening in my life right now. I'm going through a heartbreak for the first time in my life. I don't know how to deal with it.

"My mental health has been bad my whole life but probably especially since the start of the pandemic. I've been struggling a lot lately and this intense upswing in anti-endian racism everywhere I go online or even irl is affecting me. I constantly see people calling Indians ugly, hairy, smelly, subhuman, fat, losers, etc. basically my entire inner monologue to myself daily but now it's externalised. I've been feeling so low about it it's giving me some really dark thoughts and I don't know who to talk to about it or what to do to make it stop. there's this dark voice in my head that's almost getting a masochistic high from it all, and I've started seeking it out, like yes all these people have even more reasons why you are inherently worthless subhuman and unloveable. I'm really struggling badly. I also have diagnosed body dysmorphia and it's just not been a good mix. I've been ruminating on the thought that I;ve just fucked my whole life up so bad and I'm not good enough and how desperately I just wish I was ANYONE else instead of having to be me and live with all my stupid thoughts in my stupid head that just won't stop"

"I’m 19 and my birthday is in the very beginning of June, I’ve been hating growing up since I can remember (I had the worst mental breakdown on my 13th birthday) and my birthday is really bad for me because it just feels like another year wasted doing nothing while I watch everyone around me do things and live their cool life. Having depression must not help. So turning 20 js literally my worst nightmare, 18 and 19 was very bad but 20 is way worse because it’s another decade and I’ve been dreading it literally since I turned 18 and I don’t know what to do I don’t want to became 20, it feels like such an adult age and I’m already in my own apartment for school and I am NOT feeling ready to be an adult because I can barely do basic chores living taking a shower and making food. I don’t know what to do. I wish I could stop time. And this is completely something different but I feel like my friends don’t care about me and are just using me for my over kindness and I only get 1/100 of the energy and love I give out. My one true friend is not in the same city as me because I moved for uni, and the other ones are online friends but doesn’t feel like they care about me as much as I care about them. I’m going to turn 20 which is supposed to be soooo fun and so big and cool but it just feel like my life is falling apart and at the worst it could be right now. Does anyone else have this huge fear of growing up? Or this deep feeling of loneliness? How do you cope with that? "
"I am an adult. I should have a functioning social life now but I do not. no one cares about me, I have no motivation every day. I do not know what to do with this.

"Hey All,

I'm a 31F freelancer admin and recently just had my ""big fish"" client let me go (they were booked to do 25/40 hr /week....which is most of my availability.

I'm looking into getting more clients to fill the gap, but I'm also trying to apply to full-time gigs as well. But for some reason, the full-time gigs bring out these horrible feelings of worthlessness in me that overwhelm me, then I freeze and run away.

I started freelancing because it seemed like a more casual way to get work, but the inconsistency in income has been even more stressful (I have a lot of student loan debt to pay off ☹️).

There's just been so many times where it's the time to follow through on my efforts (land the job, finish the paper/project, ""cross the finish line"" so to speak) and I just choke and run away or avoid the thing entirely. And it seems like each time, my brain stores this as ""evidence"" that confirms that I suck:

- tried going to school for mechanical engineering, but choked on the coursework.

- Completed all the pre-med requirements but was too scared to take the MCAT (because historically I've sucked at exams) and my mentor at the time told me I didn't have enough ""gravitas"" to be a clinician (whereas I thought I was just trying to be friendly at work with colleagues)

- Completed all the coding coursework, but was too scared to apply to jobs for fear of a coding interview where I would reveal how stupid I am

- Finally (somehow) applied somewhere, landed a first job as a junior software engineer, but was let go after 4 weeks because they ""didn't have enough resources to support me"" (but if that was the case, then why did they hire me in the first place?? My assumption is because I suck/there's something wrong with me)

- Considered going to school to become a therapist (which I've had multiple people comment about how I would ""be a good fit""), but immediately got overwhelmed with, ""Why would anyone want advice/help from me?"" (I don't even have my own shit together yet)

- I don't make art anymore because I tanked my AP art portfolio in highschool (got a 2/6) and 

- depression and anxiety overwhelmed me when I was a middle school kid trying to apply to an arts-centric high school

- I practice singing every week for 1-3hr, yet I will not perform in front of anyone because I'm afraid that they will think I suck (even though I've received positive feedback in the past)

And the hits just keep coming. And within all of this, it seems impossible to ""figure out what I 'want' or would 'like' to do because I feel like I've just spent so long pushing through my tough feelings to get a 'responsible' job and get to a place where I finally feel safe financially and mentally. I don't know. Any advice or commiseration would be super appreciated
 Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk ☹️"

"I managed to take a feral cat 9 years ago and tame her into a sweet, kind, loving, affectionate cat. She meant the absolute world to me. But she got sick last year. I've been fighting so hard to keep her going, but it all just caught up to her. I had to have her put down today. She was so scared and I feel like I killed my best friend. I had to do it alone, because the people I thought would be there for me weren't. Other people simply were not able to come with me. Now I'm alone. She was the one I'd go to when I was hurting.

Hey so basically ive never had any friends and I’m about to graduate high school. I don’t think it’d be hard but like idk what tf im supposed to say or do. How do i approach people? Why would i randomly approach people?

"i feel so stupid writing this, and i know that the internet is a place to proceed with caution at every turn so the shame and embarrassment i feel continues to compound. but i (F25) have been non-stop communicating with someone i met on here for a good two months and it felt so wonderful to be seen and heard for first time in a long time. they were passionate, intelligent, silly and made me feel comfortable opening up little by little — which is so hard for me to do.  

well, you’d imagine my surprise when i logged in this morning and saw that they had deleted their entire account, and mind you they had been on this site for 12 years (according to their account data). i feel like an idiot for even getting emotional about it but i feel sick thinking that i might never hear from them again. i don’t know what to do besides, of course, accepting it but i don’t know. i just needed a place to vent my stupid heartbreak 💔.

i feel ugly, i feel stupid and overall i feel worthless.

"As the title says, I’ve been buying and selling stuff on this website for 10 years and I’ve never had any negative reviews. 

I had a couple of items for sale that were sitting in storage and someone wanted them. They came to pick it up yesterday (40 minutes later than the time they’d said they’ll come), and when I went to pick them up to give it to them, I noticed one of the items was a bit damaged (plastic melted from the gas stove) I had no recollection of this memory and the buyer was already at the door. So I went to them and told them about it. He just looked at it and said he doesn’t want it. I asked if he wants the other one and he said no and left. 

Mind you, the damage was only cosmetic and the item was fully functional but anyway. 

This morning I woke up to a negative review amongst my hundreds of positive reviews. I would like to keep my profile clean and I am so upset about this. I sent him a message and also contacted the site support but I haven’t heard back yet and I’m so upset that I haven’t been able to do anything all day. 

I even burst into tears earlier. 

I’m alone and while I get by my days alright, in moments like this, I feel rather helpless even though the whole story might sound rather silly and insignificant. 

I’m wondering if I should call him and speak to him over the phone. He may or may not like it…"

I don’t know why I’m like this, it has been this way for as long as I can remember, the not being able to cry in front of people thing. It’s miserable.

"Hey everyone, I hope you are all doing well. I'm feeling some guilt.

A bunch of days ago, I was on r/teenagers, and I came across a lonely person on there, and I offered to be his friend. I looked on his post history and I could tell how lonely he was, he posted on friendship-related subreddits asking for a friend and no one replied, and I couldn't help but feel bad for him.

The reason why I'm feeling guilty is because I found out he was 25 and on a subreddit meant for teens, and I reacted and stopped speaking to him. I feel guilty because I feel like I've done nothing but contribute more to his loneliness. It could be possible that his desperation for a friend led to him going to that sub in the first place, from what I can see.

I don't know if I should mention the person's username or not, but if I could, I'd do so and ask for people here to send him messages of emotional support or something. I honestly don't know if I'm right or wrong in this situation, because seeing anyone suffer from loneliness and have no one to turn to just breaks my heart.

I'd like to know your thoughts on this complex situation. Thanks for reading, you beautiful human beings."

"I have been trying to be more social and as such, when I got a message from some girl on here looking to be friends, I accepted the offer and started talking to her on Discord. Things were going okay - we had similar interests and loved the same games - and I was really hoping we could become good friends who play some games on the weekends or something. 

We were talking well until I mentioned I had a girlfriend and then she suddenly blew up at me, calling me an asshole for talking to another girl when I have a girlfriend, like it was a heinous crime or something… I just wanted someone who I could play games with or talk to every once in awhile. Since I have social anxiety, I figured finding someone online would be a good first step, but instead I was berated and hurt on my first attempt… I did not flirt with her and she even agreed I didn’t act unfaithful or flirty in any way and only acted as a friend, but said the act of even talking to someone who wasn’t a guy was basically cheating.

My confidence was pretty low to begin with but now I am deathly afraid to try and find someone else to talk to… I have my girlfriend and I love her more than I love myself, more than life itself, but she isn’t able to play games and doesn’t really want to, and i just would like to have some extra friends anyway to talk to like she does. What makes it worse is when the girl was yelling at me, she reminded me a lot of my girlfriend when she gets angry, who has abused me in the past… I could use some kind words and maybe some encouragement… im tired and afraid of people yelling at me and treating me like garbage… 💔"

"I am a bad mother, my baby doesn’t even want me. I am a loser at my work, can’t fix minor things, always confused. I am not good looking, I am fat. 

A nanny cheated me by promising to do multiple chores but did nothing. I treated her like a human and was supportive in so many ways. I also encouraged her to learn a new skill, and support her family. Her attitude when she came the first day and the day I told her I wouldn’t require her services were so different. She didn’t take good care of my baby.

Sometimes, at work, I feel I ask good questions and also answer well, but when under pressure, I can’t even say what I actually worked on. I always get influenced by other’s opinion on everything and can’t choose my decision. I always end up second-guessing my rationale, my thoughts process, my understanding. I always am overwhelmed looking at everyone. I feel like everyone else is better than me, they know a lot more. I feel stupid to even talk or ask questions. 

I feel sick."
That's really about it. I just been anxious for the past few hours. 
"I tend to make a lot of mistakes. I need to change that. I'm terrible at navigating this world. One would even say I'm a very bad person.


Once I thought someone being older meant they were automatically wiser, but I have realized that your experiences play a much more important role in how mature you become.


I have seen how bloodthirsty human beings can be and I need someone to give me advice on how to navigate this world and not become a monster myself. Someone who also has seen the depravities of humanity themself and has not lived a cushy life. Someone who can give me advice based on first-hand experiences on how not to be consumed by the abyss.


Thank you in advance."
"I always had the notion that in society, everyone should be understanding and kind to eachother, and show compassion. Whether someone makes a minor mistake. Is going through a tough time mentally or physically. Forgets about something. Needs a friendly reminder. Fairness when it comes to making business, financial or ethical decisions, etc.

But when I try to behave how society around me seems to, making my health and personal interests a priority, it's met with some sort of disapproval or hostility.

I'm just having such a hard time living in a world where some people can be so mean. It can ruin my whole day where I'll just have a big cry and feel depressed for weeks, even months. And the cycle continues when I come across another upsetting event. It's not something I ever want to experience or put up with, but sometimes it's just unavoidable.

I'm just going to wash my clothes, clean up my teary face and spend time with family as per my original plan for the day, to try and get over how I'm feeling.

"I turn 21 today, and I haven't always had a good day during it, mostly people always forget it's my birthday, I don't get gifts even if I host a party and it feels awful just in general. I'm the type of person to always give and give sure I don't ask for anything in return but sometimes it would be nice to receive something right??..hell even just a pen I'd be happy, just a drawing I'd be happy it's so rare for me to get a gift you could give me a rock and I'd be happy the bar is so low you can't even limbo under said line..

But besides all that..what made me feel worse today was my own mother sending me a Conspiracy theorists Video about Bluetooth headphones and here's the context..I wear earphones a lot, it's a support system I have/ coping mechanism when I get anxious or start having thought I just cannot be left alone with my thoughts is what I'm saying...and she sends me a no science based claim from a TikTok account that is all just conspiracy theories..no happy birthday not even like a GIF of a cake literally 6:00 am dead on That TikTok and Im already having a bad day and it just made it worse that my support system the thing that literally prevents me from unsubscribing from life Is what my own MOTHER thinks is the problem why I'm having a bad day...not the fact that people literally forgot the day I was spawned on this earth...I'm so tired man"
"For the past 4-5 years I've had problems getting myself to do... anything really. I only did enough schoolwork to pass with the lowest grades and other than that I basically rotted in my bed or at my computer.

For new years, I decided I would become a better person, and for a month it's been going pretty good, I'm exercising (although not making much progress since it's been raining for the last week and I took a week off because I almost passed out the first bike) I'm getting my school work done, I'm losing weight and finally working on some goals I had. And I'm learning to feel my emotions better (since I had cut them off a long time ago because they controlled me too much)

But while the voice in my head has gotten better at forcing myself to do things, I don't feel like I've done anything, I set my goals because I figured they'd make me feel better (and in the long run, be helpful for my life) but I'm getting worried since even after a month nothing has changed. I've never completed a goal like this in my life, will I only feel the effects after 4 months, or some other number of time? Will I only feel better after I finally done it?

All of them are long-term goals, I can't think of any short term goals to set, none that I would feel happy with at least.

The only other problem I see is that I haven't socialized (IRL) for 4 years (I talk to about 9 people online occasionally although usually 2 at a time and I have 7 family members that I talk to but other than that I have spoken a word to maybe 2 new real people over this time) I don't think this is the issue, but this is the only thing I can see myself making short term goals for (or maybe I'll get a long term goal of having 100 acquaintances, lol)

I kind of stumbled upon this place on accident, if I'm in the wrong place for this kind of post please guide me to the right place, if you know one."
"
I (20m) fell in love with my friend (20f), and confessed my feelings. She said she would love to be in a relationship, but doesn’t want something serious yet and would rather be friends. She stopped texting me and goes out of her way to avoid conversations. I don’t feel like doing anything anymore, I lost the last thing that made me happy. For context, we had been friends for about 2 years and I loved every second spent with her. We would call almost everyday we didn’t see each other and every time we did see each other, we always had a great time and often cuddled/hug. I had lost my best friend to cancer a year ago and she always was there to comfort me. She was the person who cured all of my feelings of loneliness, as I didn’t really have anyone else to talk to. No amount of words and metaphors can describe just how happy this woman made me. Her presence and warmth was such a beautiful and universal feeling, and nothing could ever replace that. She was the reason I woke up in the morning with faith, and not that she’s gone I just feel empty. The fact that we still (barley) talk as friends just hurts me even more. I’d been in love basically since the day I met her. I never ever in my 20 years on planet earth met someone who fully understands me as much as her. My friends make fun of me for being heart broken way too much for me to handle, and I just have to sit there a force I smile on my face, it just feels like pure loneliness. I miss her, I miss her so fucking much I don’t know what to do anymore. Yall can clown on me all you want I really don’t give a fuck, I’ve seen it all. I just need help"

"Hello all. I’ve been with my partner for three years, living together for two. We’ve had our fair share of “hard truth” conversations, but the one last night really shook me. My perception of our relationship, him, and myself is fractured. The context behind all of this goes incredibly deep, so I won’t try to unload it all here.

But if anybody (female, preferably. I’m kinda man-ed out) out there has the capacity to listen for a while, it would mean a lot. Down to DM or we can chat on discord, just shoot me a message and I’ll share my handle."

It’s worth the effort, but I am absolutely exhausted and feel broken myself.  I have a lot of health and relationship challenges that I’m trying to work through right now and feel very, very alone.  I think I can still work through this all, but it would just mean a lot if someone messaged and was able to talk some.  

I’m a massive nerd and those kinds of topics (fantasy, sci fi, tech, math) help distract me when I’m overwhelmed too.

Hey J,

My name is (A), I'm (B)'s good friend and roommate here. I don't know how else to say it than to just say it...
(B) wasn't feeling well the last couple of days and had a heart attack yesterday night. Which she unfortunately didn't survive...
She spoke very highly of you, how you treated her so well from the start and she was always excited to talk about you. 
You were already one of the few people really close to her. So I think she would also want me to tell you.

As her friend I want to thank you for treating her the way you did, you really made the last few weeks of her life amazing. So from the bottom of my heart thank you for that❤️
-----------------------------------------------

I'm having a hard time processing it, I'm still at work. Hiding in a quiet place...
If anyone wants to put up with the emotional mess that is me, shoot me a DM. I have no one at work and no one serious enough in my life to talk to about this. I feel if I don't talk to anyone I'll completely implode"

"Feel like an idiot for posting this, but you never know 

I've been in a horrible depressive episode for way too long, and I feel like I can't go on. People who were helping in the beginning just got used to my depression, and don't see it as an emergency or a problem.

I feel invisible. I've been sick and couldn't maintain my relationships, so my classmates, colleagues, even some of my friends moved on, it's like I never existed. 

So I'm asking you to talk about me. Not TO me, but ABOUT me, maybe in the comments. I just need to feel visible. Anything will do — if you comment ""OP has a reddit account"" this will already be immensely helpful. 

Thank you in advance!"

My (27F) friend (27F) is getting married this weekend. I’ve been super excited for this. It’s a high school friend that I’ve known for years and lot of old faces are going to be there.

Whilst I’m really happy for my friend, and super excited for a fun weekend. I’ll admit that the old voice of insecurities have hit me when I realised I wasn’t going to reach my goal to loose weight before this wedding. Over the last year I’ve gained 15lbs. This might not seem a lot to many people and I appreciate that many people have goals that are harder than mine. However I am quite short so I do feel it shows a bit more. I already can’t fit into quite a few of my older clothes that used to fit so easily, and I’m just not feeling that I look my best. 

Earlier this year, although I’d gained the weight I felt happy and confident that I could set myself a goal to loose the 15lbs before the wedding. I gained the 15lbs due stress eating from my old workplace. My boyfriend and I also moved in together and we were both snacking and drinking a lot of sugary cocktails at parties. We’ve both made it our mission to loose weight this year and have been encouraging each other, cheering each other on. 

While my boyfriend never had a “goal” of when he wanted to loose weight, he just wanted to be healthier - I was secretly hoping I’d loose the weight before the wedding. I’m about 5lbs down and still 10 lbs to go. I know 5lbs is still worth celebrating but I’m a little frustrated I didn’t reach my goal in time, or even get half way. 

This weekend will be lots of pictures and reunions and I’m feeling a little embarassed to be a “bigger” version of myself in front of old faces. I know ultimately it doesn’t matter and no one will be looking at me anyways, we’ll all be celebrating our friend. I can’t help feeling a little guilty and that voice of comparing myself to my other high school friends who will all be there and are all very thin and haven’t gained weight during this time is sort of rearing its head again. 

Any kind words or notes of advice would be appreciated.

"(I'm sorry but I can't find what L or O stand for, it's not in the rules as far as I saw)

My last two boyfriends, one being my baby's dad, broke up with me. Now I accidentally developed feelings for my roommate/babysitter, whom I had never been attracted to in the past but who used to ask me to date him. So when I got feelings for him I initially thought, omg, maybe this could be a great lovestory. But apparently his feelings for me have subsided. It's so disheartening. I'm also a severely disabled single mom, so that's probably not helping my chances with men. I really think at this point (I'm 34) I'll be without a romantic partner for the rest of my life, while everyone else I know moves on to happy marriages and raising children with a loving partner. I'm so sad and lonely and I don't even want to try dating anymore because it drags me down so much all the time, but I need to function for my job and my baby. "
"I'm a 26 M and don't know how to progress in life. I've always felt like I'm just not cut out for it. 

But I've never been able to keep friends, and the few times in my life I did have friends, (years ago now) they all ended up either hard or soft ghosting me, usually ghosting me amongst themselves while they continue to talk and be friends. It's left me in a position where I constantly think about people who were socially better than myself, and I wonder what they're up to, even though they definitely don't think about me and have most likely even better lives than they did while I knew them, and was able to see it for myself. 

I've tried therapy multiple times, I never get anything out of it or feel like the therapist really cares, although I don't do a good job of explaining myself either. Any more therapy has a year-long wait-list, and that's with expensive insurance. My dad died when I was young, and he was an asshole before that. I live with my mom still, who I've never gotten along with or had an emotionally honest conversation with, and I'm nowhere in the universe of financially close enough to be able to move out. This means that every day is extremely stressful for me, at the best of times, and somehow my home is both my default place to be but also my worst. 

Several years ago, I met a woman on Reddit who kindly messaged me after reading a sad post of mine, and we became fast friends largely because she was the only person to give me positive reinforcement and kindness, I think. She's a social worker/therapist so she pretty much knew exactly what to say to me, I guess. Over about a year though, I was unhinged enough that she one day cut off all contact with me suddenly, and this destroyed me even further. I was already in a bad place but just got even worse somehow. I felt like she abandoned me, like all my other friends across my life. To be clear, I never threatened her or anything, I just came across as unstable over text chat, because I was. 

Over the course of our friendship, she sent me a bunch of, basically, platonic letters of positive encouragement, and those notes are genuinely the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. Basically telling me about my good qualities she saw in me and that I'm worth it. She also included her phone number in one of the notes, and at another low point about eight months ago, I texted that number with a brief apology for how I treated her. First she lied saying the number wasn't hers, and I said okay, then she texts back saying that she lied because I made her feel unsafe, and that if she ever hears from me again she'll call the cops. I said ok and that I'm sorry I made her feel that way. Then, for the only time so far in my life, I threw up out of stress and grief, the feeling of being abandoned all over again by someone I really trusted, and that had a unique connection with me. I try to keep her out of my mind, but I fail every day, usually first thing in the morning. Even though she hates me, and I think that hatred is undeserved, I genuinely hope she's doing well and helping others, because my experience with her was positive enough that it's somehow still the best thing that's ever happened to me. That feeling combined with the guilt of making the world a darker place is a really potent mood-killer.

Both because of my life of social failure and whatever else makes me just not competent like most others, I can't seem to go forward with life at all. I hate any school experience and job I've ever had. I still like the idea of friends but would probably be terrible at actually maintaining friendships and wouldn't want to do it. Somewhat similarly, I'm open to the idea of dating but wouldn't want to date most people because of our discrepancy in experiences, although this will be the least of my problems lol. I remember, years ago at university when I had some friends, the friend I spent the most time with said he doesn't really like me, so much as the idea of me. He meant that I was pretty boring (he wasn't the only friend then to call me boring, they were right then and people would be right now to say the same thing) and didn't contribute much to a group dynamic, but that I was also easy to get along with and do whatever the other person wanted. Now, I don't have any more personality than I used to, but I guess I am a little more cynical and stubborn.

I used to think that all knowledge and experiences make their survivors stronger eventually, but now I just wish I could forget the people I used to know and the awkward experiences and abandonment I've gotten from them. Genuinely forgetting doesn't seem to be an option though. So how do I move forward with a life and at least do the bare minimum to help those around me?"
"I’ve been working on myself a lot by going to school, volunteering at the animal shelter and even went to this video game club at my school but I feel out of place for lots of reason and I can’t tell nobody this because I get treated like garbage for being honest about my experience….. 

I’ve tried therapy before and it garbage…. All my therapist told me…. wow that suck when I was venting about my school and all my questions were dodge too like he keep changing the subject….

I already went to four different therapist and none of them doesn’t help and it not for me….. they all said the same thing….. I’m starting to run out of money because of them and I need a break from them too….

I’m crying right now because I’m keep dealing with the pain of loneliness and autism and I’m feeling hopeless and I’ve work so hard to improve myself and to put myself out there and it lead to no where…..

I don’t even know if I’ll ever graduate from college and get my dream job….. 

I’ll never have a group of friends and a social life that I crave so much…..

"Hey all, I'm so glad this part of reddit is here. I just need to get all sorts of thoughts out of my head and down and know that someone has maybe read them. I've been seeing this guy since September, but it's been on again off again situation. The last straw came when he had a meltdown at me and left in a snit, and I took a few weeks of thinking it was over, and then reached out to him. We both missed each other, both were sad, and he said he'd see me when he came back. I 

By back -- well, he spends three to four months a year travelling, basically homeless, and this is it. He is a crappy texter (I'm talking like one text a week maybe, although when he's more communicative, it's maybe one a day and not an especially long one). 

While he was away, in March, I found msyelf getting frustrated with the situation of me sending him messages and him not responding. Was there any relationship at all?  I sent a long email telling him he had to either end it with me or continue. It was hurting me. We ended up discussing things on the phone and he again said he'd see me when he came back, but it wouldn't be until mid April (I had expected him to see me in March, between his trips... but he just kept on traveling I guess), but he promised to be a better communicator. 

At first he was. He texted once a day and that wasn't great but it was okay. But that became silence for the last four or five days and I'm starting to lose my mind again. I check my phone constantly to see if he's been online at all (he hasn't in two days). And then, because what's app let's you know the last person was on the app, if he goes online, I'm angered that he hasn't read my messages or responded to them. It's a constant cycle and I have archived him so I can't see him... but I know how to unarchive it and of course that's what I do. I am not ready to completely erase him. I feel like I should be able to do it because this situation sucks. 

I'm not sure what I think is going to happen in two weeks when I see him -- assuming he sees me in two weeks. I've told myself that I should just continue as if we'd broken up because he seems to lack the ability to end it with me, and I can't bring myself to end it with him either. I have gone chasing him back every single time I thought things ended (granted, I'm not sure if he knew things ended any of those times, but in my mind it was quite clearly the end because I was like, I'm out and for him, he just doesn't feel the need to be in touch with me at all).

"I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit page for what I’m going through and I don’t know what to do or who to turn to. It’s a long story, but to condense everything, I’m a 35 year old disabled male and I’ve been good friends with someone (It’s kind of complicated), but we’ll say that we’ve been friends for almost a decade. They’ve been someone who I can rant to and talk to about anything. They were there when I was at my lowest point in life and they were there when I needed someone to talk to. Well, one of the things I have been ranting about lately is that I believe my family is overstepping there boundaries, in terms of treating me like a child, instead of the 35 year old male that I am. I understand my family cares for me and are concerned when I go out because of my disability, but I believe they are really overbearing. Well, a family member called me me when I was out with my friend and asked where I was at. I had to kind of lie because I believe some family members are using the ring security system at my apartment to spy on my personal conversations. Well, I was talking to them, then my friend just snapped and said that was an adult and they had no right to treat me they way they did. I did agree with their sentiment, but the way they said it was extremely disrespectful and I was embarrassed about what happen. Because of that the eclipse I was planning to go to next week, that was canceled because my family member said I couldn’t go and used our relationship as a family as leverage. I agree that it was wrong on my family member’s part to talk to me the way they did, but I know they care for me and I know that my friend overstepped their boundaries. They frequently apologized for what happened, but my family isn’t having any of it and I’m stuck in the middle. I’m pretty upset with my friend and they’ve apologized to me. I’ve forgiven them, but I know that there will be roadblocks to our friendship now by my family. I know this post is kind of vague and I do apologize for that. It would be a very long post if I shared the entire backstory, but if you ask in the comments, I’ll be more than happy to fill in the gaps. Thanks and any advice is appreciated.  "

"Like the title says, the last 3 months have been horribly traumatic. Our 6 year old dog Frankie died January 16th from cancer after a 2 year battle with lymphoma. Our other dog Dave had to have an emergency tail amputation 3 days before Christmas, which happened to be the weekend we almost lost Frankie the first time. My dad wound up in the ICU on January 14th and almost died from an infection, and this weekend my mother in law was admitted to the hospital awaiting test results on masses growing in her stomach and bladder.

I'm worried about my husband, I haven't slept more than about 4 hours this weekend and I just feel helpless and traumatized. I think myself, Dave, and my husband are all feeling pretty defeated at the moment."
"I am not religious in the slightest. But since my sister died I've been reading about a number of things, NDEs, terminal lucidity, these visions hospice patients have- my mom used to work in hospice and told me they're not hallucinations, they don't go away when you medicate against hallucinations- this stuff is comforting because it's not just wishful thinking. To me, it's stuff that might be actual, tangible evidence I'll see my sister again. I don't care what anyone else believes, it helps me out, okay?

Why are redditors do hellbent on convincing me I'm a soulless biomechanical robot? I'm not kidding. I've been constantly told this, that I have no soul, any weird experiences I've had that have been comforting could just be from my brain lying to me, and that's fucking gaslighting.

Truth be told, even if you're an atheist, I don't get why a sort of metaphorical ""soul"" couldn't exist. Personhood basically. Your self, your uniqueness. That's still how I'd see it if I was an atheist. It is depressing being told over and over that I'm a machine. That I'm a ""biological entity"" and a robot. Don't fucking dehumanise me like that! Don't dehumanise my sister or family like that. Fuck you for having the audacity to tell me how to grieve a really difficult fucking loss.

Why are redditors so scummy? It's not just to do with spirituality. It doesn't matter what you say on this app, someone will always tell you you're wrong, you're a moron, you can't be trusted, this kind of thinking made me nearly suicidal. It's horrible. They are the most snarky, rude people. Grieving is hard enough without adshats needing to ""debunk"" everything I believe in and ruin everything I like."

I just got done with a friendship which I viewed very differently than the other person, and they were kind of just using me to feed their ego. I had to block them last night.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to do this anymore. Working on 4 hrs of sleep is grueling, especially when my shift is double that length.

I don’t know what I need. I just want someone to tell me that I am doing the right thing. Because genuinely, I don’t think I can do this much longer.

"Hey, y'all,

All my life I wanted to be an artist, creating beautiful works of art with great skill and joy. But it was never in the cards; art was a continuous struggle, and every piece I made was disappointing and shameful. Every attempt I made to get better (and I tried everything I could short of unethical means) felt like trying to jump to the moon on a pogo stick: Nothing I did felt natural, intuitive, or sensible. This summer, I tried chasing that dream again to prove that I could become an artist, and I tried harder than ever and tried everything I could, but it became overwhelmingly clear that art and I aren't meant to be.

Plus, I spent 30 years dreaming and wishing and attempting, and all I've gotten was heartache. Every time I think about art, my heart feels like it's filled with shards of glass. This makes me terrified to dream other dreams; losing this one has already devastated me, and I can't bear to think about losing another one. Out of that fear, I've thought about trying to chase my art dream, no matter how painful or difficult the journey would be, but I know I have to let it go. Doing art means constantly struggling with envying others, hating my own art, feeling like a dog trying to play the trumpet, and remembering all the bad experiences I've had. It's too much to bear.

I'm grieving, but I'm not in denial nor in shock. I knew this day was a possibility. I just thought I was ready for it, or that I'd be able to prevent it. But I'm not ready for it. I'm feeling a pain I can't seem to put into proper words.

I'm trying to put a positive spin on this by reminding myself that life goes on, life is good, and other dreams may come true. But art is the big thing I've always wanted to do, and letting go of 30 years of dreams is like trying to forget my own name. And it breaks my heart, because everything in me aches to create something wonderful, and I can't, no matter how hard I try or what I do. All I wind up with is art that's miles away from what I want it to be and no means to improve it, and I don't know how to be happy with inferior art or raise my already shattered self-esteem, so I have no choice but to let my dream die.

How do I let it die, and how do I move on?

Thanks,  
Leo"

"I'm 36F/NB. Very chronically ill and disabled, mostly homebound, dealing with a medical crisis and a lot of stress and grief around some recent life events. I've also got mental health issues, autism, trauma, and I'm still COVID cautious.

I've tried talking to people but most don't understand that I'm really just looking for validation and someone to listen, not advice or positivity or someone saying it'll be ok. I also keep getting people saying harmful things like I'm so strong and they wouldn't want to live if they were me. It's meant to be a compliment I guess but it just makes me feel worse.

I just want to be treated like a person and with kindness and empathy. I'm happy to offer that to someone else going through really difficult things too. I've found mutual support can make me feel more comfortable opening up and I like being able to help people. I'm open to a longer term connection as well but won't go in expecting anything.

Feel free to send me a chat request. I'd appreciate folks who have a decent amount of time to talk right now, I have trouble keeping up connections when messages are really sporadic or infrequent. I also usually get along best with folks who are open-minded, liberal/left leaning, ok with pessimism and dark thoughts, and have some understanding or experience around disability, trauma, neurodivergence etc. I'd rather not have to do a lot of explaining."
My brother got diagnosed with cancer and he talked like it was nothing and he going to get his analis done to know more about it and follow the treatment... But it for me it is really sad and makes me angry too. You see my brother is obsessed with health all he did was to improve his health. Regular sports diet no smoke not alcohol... He has never done any drugs or party he just studied. He actually just finished his Ph.d he literally just studied his entire life. To get diagnosed with metastasis from a melanona. I was looking up and that is not a joke. Melanoma is easy to beat when caught in time if not then chanses are really low. Maybe he appears fine outside but i can't imagine how he must feel because himself was saying that he wants to live the most time possible...

today after work i was going to go to target and pay for it, i felt really guilty and i just wanted to pay for it

but at 12:14, my sister called me. she knew i was at work and i know she would never call me unless it was something important. i answered and i could tell she had been crying, but then she told me our cat passed. i broke down in the bathroom and had to go home early

he was 17 years old, but i feel like this was the impending doom i was feeling. i always feel very anxious about my actions because i feel like they will effect me later on and this is that. 

i just lost my dog too so this is just another huge loss that i don’t know how to deal with"
"I like space, cats, The Hunger Games, Spongebob, medical dramas and anything medical related and I want to eather be a mortition or an EM doctor. I also want to be a singer as I LOVE singing! I can see out of my right eye and that eye is not as good and I have some developmental delays so my skills are not as good and I ate through a feeding tube because my body had trouble when I was little. So I cannot swallow well and I cannot throw up at all and I prefer the feeding tube But I will drink water by mouth. I was featured in a documentary called mystery diagnosis and the baby who changed colors, that's the episode name, second segment on there, and you can watch it on DaillyMotion. My name is Isabel and I am 19 years old and I am from Georgia. My ramily are narccassists and WAY too overprotective of me, when I tried to leave and called the police to back me up legally, it backfired! So now I have no phone and I am secretly using an internet browser on my Alexa Device, as my family believes everyone on the web is BAD. Hell, they even made me watch doccumentaries on sextual preditors, trying to screw me up! It did, but I refuse to show emotion and give them what they went. They at least allow me to read and watch tv, as they take me to the library, but STILL! I AM TREATED LIKE A CHILD! They even say I am mentally a chilf, making up excuses about my delays, true, but I also never had the chance to grow up! Never had sex, never went to collage, never had a job."

"I'm  stuck living with the severe guilt of the one truly bad thing I did in my life back in my early teens (i think around 14). 

The guilt I feel and the worry about the people invilved has ruined my life and I just don't know what to do. It has also ruined my family's life because I've been a severely depressed and anxious mess my whole life (I'm now 40).

I haven't been able to function at all and am unable to be in a relationship, I have severe social anxiety and I barely leave the house. 

I'm also living now with the fear of seeing my life slip away and the guilt and regret of not being able to enjoy my life with my family.

I try to Google help and all I find are help sites for victims and forums about how terrible people are. So it just validates what I've done as being unforgivable.

I don't know who to see as they'll just judge me for being a bad person and not help/make things worse. 

If it's of worth mentioning it I am a very empathetic and kind person in general and it almost makes it worse having everyone say as such as I'm living with this terrible secret that I can't forget or forgive myself for.

Is there help and if so which should I see?

Thanks in advance "

"I 17f don’t like too much noise or crowded places. I have about seven friends, but we never hang out outside of school, and many of them don't even know each other. My 18th birthday is in a month, and I want to do something with some of them, but I don't know how to ask. I don't want a party; maybe just a small gathering at a restaurant to talk. But I'm worried about how to invite them and what to do if no one wants to come. I feel lonely and like my friends don't value me as much as I value them. I don't have much of a social life, and I don't drink or vape like many people my age. I feel terrible and am almost certain I'll spend my birthday only with my parents. My mom encourages me to go out and have fun, but I'm sure I wouldn't enjoy the parties my friends go to. This post might be confusing since I'm crying, and English isn't my first language, but I'm desperate at this point."

Tw suicide talk

I'm 17, I don't want friends, don't leave the house, don't work or go to school, I'm pretty much useless and spend all day sitting in my bed watching anime and reading books, I only leave to eat dinner or sit on the stairs and do basically what I already do...except on the stairs. I feel very sad about the fact that I care more for things and my one intense interest more than I do for people but i don't go out anyway so who cares.

Tonight I fucked up my hobby sketchbook by trying to use marker over a sketch and feel deep regret and for the last few hours I've have the urge to show my parents that I'm stressed by throwing out my favorite things and telling them about the fact that I don't want a job or school because I have no aspirations and simply want to be euthanized,  i really dont like how my brain and the way i work seems to be really fucked up. I cant do education because i have such a burning anger towards teachers. I know this isnt true but i feel strongly that theyre mostly pedos, cruel sadistic freaks who got bullied in school, cruel sadistic freaks who were bullies in school and people with a desire for power. I want to punch my dad a lot and make him concerned for me and I want to kick and throw things and declare that I'm not speaking to anyone again and actually going through with it. I really want my parents to realise something is wrong because they never do. Around a month ago my mother took me to see a gp about the potential of myself having autism because I've had multiple school staff in the past just assume I have it because of the way I act, and not do much as, due to my age they assume I've already been diagnosed. On the ride home she told me about how much she believes I shouldn't seek a diagnosis even if it would benefit me. I do have to agree with her, if I got diagnosed I'd probably kill myself. My mother insists I should just pray and ill magically loose my struggles.

Anyway, I've just been really fantasising about causing damage to myself and others in order to elicit concern from the people around me. Hurting old friends, teachers, family(but never my brother). 
I really want to hurt them badly and make  them feel forced to do something and worry about if I'm stable or not.

I don't know why because it's an odd desire. I really wish I could just talk to them but we aren't that kind of family.

I just wish I could be listened to, nobody cares to hear me and I don't express my issues because I don't want to be serious with my parents as its uncomfortable.
I will never succeed. I have no desire to do anything with my life. No desire to make friends or do anything that doesn't concern my like 2 interests and no interest in contributing."

"(I don\\t feel like it's relevant to write out my entire life story at this point, but feel free to ask questions.)

I have struggled with mental health issues for as long as I can remember. For the past 8(-ish) years I have been going through the motions and did what was expected of me, mostly. I didn't feel much 'satisfaction' after whatever it was that I did. Of course there were exceptions, but they seem to happen less and less.

My main issue is that my inner critic is very strong and persistent, and usually the root of the problem. (I figured this out with help of a therapist, currently doing schema therapy.)

Partly but not fully because of this, I have very low motivation to do pretty much anything. This obviously makes me feel even worse about myself. (I already stopped working for a while, so whatever burn out related stuff could have been going on, is probably fixed.)

It's not just chores and stuff, it's also fun activities. I just can't be too bothered. Sometimes I can make myself enjoy something for a little while but it never lasts.

I am currently on some medication which seemed to be helping me a lot in the first 2 weeks of my dose being upped, but now I am crashing again, which makes sense, but still.

I am trying all I can do to make things better for myself. I keep pushing myself, I keep trying to improve the things I can improve (I quit drinking 4+ months ago and some other bad habit \~2 months ago)

I eat healthy (for as much as I am capable of), I work out 2-3 times a week (even though I have recently developed a medical condition that's making it hard for me, but that's another story...)

I told to and meet up with friends and family, I try to do volunteer work every now and then..

And most of all, I try my damn hardest to make my head a less bad place to me in - but all to no avail.



It just feels like I have given up on life and can't pick myself up.

The fact I have a genetic disease that can 'basically kick in at any moment' probably doesn't help either.

(I feel so much pressure to make something of my life that it words counter productive, I think.)



It also doesn't help that my mental state isn't as stable as I would want it to be.  I am trying to relearn experiencing emotions but that's hard enough on it's own, let alone the fact that there obviously is a reason why I blocked them out long ago. I just can't handle myself. And it sucks so hard to be trying your best but it doesn't seem to get any easier.

  
How do I get motivated again? How can I make myself appreciatie just being alive again?



Sorry if this all was one incoherent mess. My inner critic often don't even let me speak, let alone write, so I tried my hardest to just give it a go and not overthink it.



PS.

I don't know what I need or what would help me, but you all seem super nice so I wanted to give this sub a shot. &lt;3

"Hi, i enjoy the internet and parts of reddit, tho there are so many toxic people as well, people who misunderstand things and then start insulting based on nonesense. Its annoying and i just wanna find a place where people are kind."
"Hello everyone. I'm really feeling alone right now. I'm crying and laying in bed. I'm having another lonely moment. I just wish I could receive a long, warm hug, even talking about it makes my heart ache. As much as I'm kind to others, especially on this sub, I sometimes feel like no one will be there for me, but I guess it's my mind playing tricks on me.

I appreciate any kind words or advice. Thanks for reading."
"I hope I made this post correctly, I havent used reddit in about a decade and the last time I did was the only time I did. Please correct me if Ive done anything wrong.

I've been going through a lot of internal conflicts the last several months triggered by some external things that have happened in my life. I could really use someone to talk to who could give me feedback on things or something. Truthfully I dont know what exactly Im looking for other than to feel like a normal human being that wants to exist in this world.

A summary of my issues:
- personal identity
- gender identity
- feeling worthless
- social anxiety
- worry way too much
- fear rules over me
- relationship issues
- generational depression
- generational anxiety
- a childhood that left me with a lot of subconscious issues that Ive been trying to work through

I'd really prefer someone LGBTQ+ friendly and not religious/spiritual in any way. Gender doesnt matter though please do be aware that I have gender identity issues that I'd like to talk about and it could be a sensitive area for both parties.

A little about me:
I know a little about a lot of things, or as Ive felt about it lately, ""my knowledge is a mile wide but an inch deep."" I like nature, philosophy, and music. I know a little about cognitive behavioral therapy and try to apply it in my life when I can, but mostly try to apply Stoic philosophy principles to my life instead. For music, for the last year or so my music has been mostly Will Wood and Watsky, but I listen to a lot of different stuff.

"I just turned 31 yesterday, yet I've been feeling very lonely and depressed for a very long time. I think the reason why my loneliness and depression are very rampant is because of the fact that I have been single since I was 19, without a kiss from a woman since I was 24, and without a hug from a woman who wasn't a family member since last September. Sometimes, my loneliness and depression are really bad, and they trigger really dark thoughts. I also have Asperger's/autism, high social/approach anxiety, very low confidence/self-esteem, the constant perception that women hate me for no reason, and the constant fear of rejection. 

I have tried every single dating app imaginable, yet I've not been successful whatsoever. I'm also very jealous/ envious of my friends/family who are dating/married, especially my younger sister (28F), who has been engaged since last October. Even though I'm happy for her and her fiance, it doesn't help with my current situation. At this point, I personally feel like I'm either comparing myself to my friends/family who are dating/married or competing with them, and I'm already in dead last place. 

So, if there are any kind voices out there, I would love to hear from them. "
"To keep this post from being too long, I’m gonna keep details to a minimum. If you want more context, I can provide it in the comments. 

Pretty much every facet of my life is unraveling at the seams. 

I have no social support except for one long-time friend who I only see or talk to every few weeks.

I’ve stopped speaking to my mother because she is emotionally abusive. Well, technically she stopped speaking to me. Long story short, a few months ago, she was being really disrespectful and screaming at me and instead of taking it like I used to in the past, I stood up to her and matched her energy. She went off on me, hung up in my face (we were on the phone), and sent me a string of hateful texts. We have barely spoken since. I spent the holidays alone. For the past few months, I’ve stayed at hotels and AirBnbs whenever I’ve flown to the state where she lives.   

I am pretty much estranged from the rest of my family too, so I’m pretty much alone in the world. 

Aside from the lack of social support, I started a new job in October that I’m just not good at. It’s difficult, fast-paced and stressful, and it’s not even work I like or want to do long term. I also have chronic insomnia, which makes it hard to even commute to the job in the mornings, let alone perform well.  I’m so bad at it that I got put on a PIP on Thursday. I have 45 days to improve or I’m fired. 

I’ve researched some new companies and applied to one new role, as I’m trying to be selective this time and not just apply to any job. (That’s what got me into this mess.) 

But even with the PIP, I’m still having trouble finding the motivation to job search. I’m fucking tired. 

I know what I probably need to do to fix my problems, but I’m just too tired to do them. I feel like I’ve been putting out fires nonstop for several years and I just want to rest. I’m running out of groceries and can’t even find the energy to go buy more. All I can do is lay in a dark room. 

I feel like just quitting effective immediately because I’m tired of the stress. But I’m so scared to be without a stable job in this economy - even with 5-6 months of savings. 

I swear, sometimes suicide feels like the only way out. Besides, it’s not like I’m part of anyone’s daily life anyway. I know I’m no one’s favorite person. It would probably take weeks for anyone to even realize I had died. "
"I'm an on-call server at this hotel and recently after new management came in, everybody's hours got decreaeed. I'm leaving this state next month so who knows if I work anything else there.
They threw me in the bar since the main bartender is away and I don't have much of experience. I only know how to do margaritas and some other basic stuff. I did it a few times and people were content with that. But today the group we had in was very demanding and particular. They kept asking for complicated cocktails. I felt confused and humiliated.
One guy went like, ""Oh wtf you put in this drink? Tell me the recipe huh? You know wtf you're doing?""
I left and said I didn't feel well, I knew it was gonna get worse.
The hotel is trying to save labor and we had 2 events today and the office people would help instead. They are trying to have people working for like 6 hours a week every once."
"I feel like there's a someone physically suffocating me. I've never had panic attacks my entire life and today I have had two. It's truly the worst feeling in the world. 

He has been cheating the whole time. I really really really wish there were signs that he had some kind of crazy sex addiction. How can I be so stupid and so utterly blind. I cannot stop crying and I'm the kind of person who burys emotions. 

I feel like I can't even move my feet one in front of the other. It's starting to give me so much anxiety that I am trembling writing this. HOW can someone be so good at lying? How do you ever trust anyone ever again??

The only silver lining has been my parents driving two hours just to come give me a hug. They gave me a pep talk, my mom cleaned for me, and my dad bought groceries. That really helped cause I wouldn't have been able to even do the dishes myself today. 

Idek what I need. Has anyone gone through unbelievable betrayal where you thought you knew your best friend but you were completely wrong? 

I feel like my life went up in flames.

"24m. I attempted suicide a few weeks ago, and I have a plan for it again. I lost everything. Both my furbabies of 4 years, I lost my job working with special needs patients which was the most rewarding work ive ever done. I lost the two people who were the closest and only people I had for two years, simply because of the pain I go through, and because i attempted suicide. All in the same week. I went into a suicide attempt thinking I'd lose it all, just to come out of it realizing I truly did lose everything.
This has happened so many times, and i've been nothing but vulnerable, respectful, and supportive to them, to everyone. That's why it hurts so much. If If was just selfish, unwilling to be cecpiteble to change, I wouldn't of been the one abandoned, or hurt. Unfortunately I couldn't even do it if I tried. 

I've tried to be a loving person, but I have nobody left to care about. Its left me so broken. All ove wanted out of life, is to love, and be loved. Maybe thats my biggest problem. I dont see people for what they are or their past, I see pepople for what they can grow into. So i miss all of the red flags. 

Im taking one last shot in the dark before i make another attempt on my life."
"hi, i hope this finds everyone well. i was thinking about how the holidays can be rough, and im really proud of everyone here for seeing it through. i want to offer everyone one last present for the season!! maybe even as a tiny prize for surviving another year. if you need a little pick me up for any reason, i would like to make you a tiny digital care package. write me a message detailing some of your favorite things [music, hobbies, etc], ill write back this weekend with a doodle/little note and a mini playlist as well as anything extra that might be uniquely applicable to you/your situation. i really hope this is the right place to post this, i just want it to reach people who might really deserve a tiny happy thing.

"I live with Cptsd, schizoaffective disorder, and other some other conditions. My journey hasn’t been the easiest to say the least but I feel blessed.

I just want to talk with someone willing to pretend to care about me for a little while. 

I have been feeling ready to end it, and not with any dramatic flourish or anything. I am just ready for my flame to extinguish, I think, and I am tired of asking for help."

Ever since I graduated from college back in May 2023, I’ve been struggling. I was lucky enough to get a job right out of college, but I got laid off after 5 months because the company ran into financial problems. Ever since then, I’ve been trying to find work, but I don’t have a lot of experience in my field and most jobs require more experience or skills that I don’t have. So it’s hard to find opportunities. I’ve been applying to jobs m, but every one of them either rejects me outright or I don’t make it past the first round of interviews. And so I’m stuck living with my parents and I’m running out of money from my last job. 

My social life and romantic life are practically nonexistent. I have some friends from college and high school, but we never get to hang out because they’re all busy and have different lives than I do. I’m struggling to find people because I’m scared to put myself out there because of trauma from my past, and I struggle to make friends because I’m autistic. And I haven’t had a date in 5 years after the person I thought I was going to marry broke my heart. 

And meanwhile, I see all the people around me getting all the things that I want. A friend of mine just got engaged. Another just got married. An acquaintance and someone that I had a crush on in high school are expecting. There are others I know who have gotten married and/or started families. My brother has friends he’s constantly doing things with and a girlfriend he’s talked about proposing to some time in the next few years. And I’m happy for all of them, but I can’t feel envious, hurt and angry because it reminds me of how lonely I am and all the things that I want but don’t have. 

I’m so disappointed and upset because I’ve worked hard my whole life to make my dreams come true. I worked my tail off in school and strived to get good grades, no matter how difficult or stressful the work got. I’ve done my best to be a good person, and persevered through every challenge life threw at me. I thought at this point in my life, I would be advancing in my career, have a tight knit friend group, and be happily married and living in a nice place. But I have *nothing.* 

I’m feeling depressed and losing hope. How do I get my life together and get the things I want?"
"I'm being abused and unfortunately there's no one to talk to, not right now at least. I just need some support and someone to be with me for a while. You don't have to give advice.

"I dated my ex for 7 years - he was my first love. I broke up with him in April of 2023 because after he finished his graduate degree and I still had years to go, he became pushy about our timeline. He insisted on moving in and did not respect my space in the apartment. He was dead set on proposing to me despite neither of us being financially stable and my desire to finish my doctorate before marriage. He became controlling and rude to my family. After we ended things, he’s behavior was disrespectful and after he spammed my phone with a verbal rant and subsequent apologies I blocked him on July 4 and haven’t spoken to him since. In August 2023 I discovered he had moved on and I spent all of September mourning our relationship. Just last week, my family got wind that he would be getting married in Hondoras, but we discovered he already had a civil union wedding in June 2024 and will be having a wedding in Hondoras next September. Just yesterday I saw his grand proposal in Cabo (he wouldn’t go to Cabo with me it was too far) despite already being married with a big wedding planned. I am IN MY FEELS. I am feeling exactly like I did last September when I found out he had moved on. I know I don’t want to be with him but I have so many questions for him. Luckily the odds of us seeing each other ever again are slim but I almost wish we had one last civil conversation. 

He has been so public about this relationship and despite having him blocked I end up seeing everything. He accused me of being public on Instagram and fearful of seeing things if I ever got into a new relationship but he is doing exactly that. He also told me the night of the breakup he would move on first. 

I am a therapist myself and I see a therapist. I have a supportive network and I journal all of the things I want to say to him but I feel like I want nothing more than to get this out of my mind. "

Trying to allow any feeling of guilt or frustration just pass through so hoping writing it out helps that

Been hard few weeks/years/life 😅  my partner’s dad had been sick for a while so it’s been a long haul of a grieving process. Now that he’s gone I think it’ll allow for more to pass through and allow the real grieving to begin. Been trying my best to be present but also have been struggling with the typical “capitalism” weight of the world and health stuff which is nothing new. Constantly feel on edge of loosing everything bc so much overhead of bills/debt/pop up payments like my car etc. Been trying my best to not take on too much but also have felt the need to do it all bc part of me feels i can’t afford to not. 

Made a mistake which I full heartedly own of taking on an overnight cat sitting gig that didn’t pay very well and was during the midst of his dad’s last bout of degrading health. I tried my best to express I’d be happy to leave and come home anytime as it was very close by, but in hindsight I understand that’s a lot to put on someone grieving and should’ve just canceled it all together and stayed home with him. Same weekend was when I got flat tire and had to spend $1k on car so my mind was definitely not in right place to make good conscious decisions either but still no excuse and I get how it was a form of abandonment to him 

Weekend his dad actually passed I had a gut feeling it would happen and unfortunately had already booked a big pop up show and couldn’t afford to loose the $700 investment. He understood and said it was okay for me to do it. His mom thankfully came and supported. I still feel guilty for not being there but also without the income I made I wouldn’t have made rent/bills etc. 

Following weekend I also had a pop up in hometown. I tried to ask for refund but they wouldn’t offer so I’d be out $200. Not end of the world but made mistake of mentioning to my partner and he said go for it, and I said I would be home Monday/Tuesday at latest. Again, in hindsight I should’ve just canceled and took financial hit. While up there my mom has been struggling health wise and my brother was going through tough time so I stayed Monday night. Tuesday I was planning to check in and should’ve just said I’ll be home but made mention about possibly staying one more day, which pushed my partner over edge and understandably.

Not trying to play victim in any sense bc I know grieve is complex and this isn’t about me..just his words can hit so sharply and literally make me feel like a cruel evil unempathetic money focused selfish asshole, and I know it’s not true but feeling has just been hard to shake."
"Hi. I'm 23. I have low/no desire to do anything. I've been killing my attention span and willpower for the past 5 years or so. I'll just mention whatever feels relevant in no particular order.


I've always felt a bit different socially speaking, I noticed this when I started high school. I didn't really do anything outside of class. I repeated high school year three times. I used to randomly screm in class a few times every day, I stopped around 16yo. I also ate paper around that period and later on. Paper, napkins. 


Outisde school I spent my whole day online playing games, scrolling, masturbating to pornography, eating junk food. I still do.


So as I kept failing and being kind of socially awkward, by 2020 I had really isolated myself. I was 20. Started smoking and loving weed, smoked like a gram per day, stopped, started again, etc. From that point onwards up until today I went hard on the degeneration, I had no school now which meant more free time to play, masturbate, scroll, etc. Drugs were a plus. Fantasizing about girls giving me attention. But that was the extent of it, fantasy. Daydreaming about building social circles, doing stuff.


Not long ago I had quite a realization, an epiphany if you will, that showed me how much repressed emotions I had. I always thought I was ""just a loser"", ""just low self esteem dude"", ""just awkward with people"" etc etc but that day I understood it's not a random thing, we are shaped by our childhood. I realized my father figures were on the abusive side. I lived with fear in my own home since 10/11 years of age and obviously learned to repress that and live with it, pretending I wasn't afraid of my dad. But it's all there, I resent my family for not doing much against it, I'm awkward with people, I don't seem to get them. My empathy is so low but on the rare occasion I manage to ignore my coping mechanisms, I burst out crying. I have so much repressed anxiety ANGER, shame, guilt, etc. 

I just KNOW that underneath all the repressed stuff is something good, I remember feeling more energized, smarter, more clarity in my brain, charismatic, funny, etc etc. I had a few good days where the baggage was dropped and I felt like this and Realized it was my actual true self, my nature. But the energy quickly drops, I suppose that it all goes into sheltering my ego from the repressed trauma/emotions.


I'm very selfish (and yet, like with the rest of problems, I feel this conflicts with me because deep down I don't belueve myself to be selfish, I help out and act from my heart when I'm on my rare ""good days""), rarely doing things for others, always thinking about how I look, how my actions look, to appear confident, etc. I struggle to see women as anything but sexual creatures, constantly craving their validation and attention (not necessarily sexual). 


I don't feel like I know myself. I've always felt my connections with people were superficial and now I know it's because my connection with myself is superficial. I'm just not there.


I could go on but I think this enough lol. So to get to the point of this post:


I'm not doing what I know can help me. This realization about having tons of repressed emotions showed me that it'd be a very good first step to start therapy, psychoanalytic and/or somatic (The Body Keeps The Score stuff always made sense to me), and go from there but I'm just NOT doing it. I keep saying aight this week I'll definitely look up good professionals close by and visit a few to start the process of finding one I like, but no. I spend the day scrolling youtube, twitter, reddit, etc. Playing game, pornography, cigarette. I know meditation can help but God forbid I spend any anount of time without stimulation. I'm getting more and more irritated by my family when they ask for stuff, which has taught them to leave me alone in my room which breaks my heart. But I cringe and resist opening up to them.


I crave compassion from outside, like some benevolent stranger showing they understand me and that they believe in me, knowing I can heal and grow. Is this actually my desire for SELF compassion projected onto other people? Is my apparent lack of belief in myself causing me to look for others to believe in me? 


I'm just tired. I know I CAN keep going like this, I'll just really regret it, but right now I can avoid that feeling because I still ""have time"". I've always fantasized about that, ""having time"" and turning into a winner... But next week. Or next month, right now I just keep watching YouTube and playing Brawl Stars.


I know that despising this behaviours and just brute-forcing my way out of procrastination is not the way, that's why I consider  some kind of therapy to be the first step I should take.

"I recently read some messages between them all (immediate blood relation) and they all believe that I owe *them* an apology. For being abused. By them. 

No apologies or acknowledgment from them for abusing me. They’re narcissistic and refuse to accept any idea that they are bad people. Even though they know they do terrible things.

They got off on the power trip of hurting me when I was a kid because I was vulnerable and kind. Whenever they were stressed or angry about anything, they would find me and hurt me. Because I would cry and scream to their satisfaction. Causing me pain satisfied them. 

I could use some validation. Even something to make me angry at them again. I refuse to be their victim again."
"My whole childhood my bullies have managed to turn my friends against me. I rarely had friends to begin with. In highschool it happened too. It’s happening again now that I’m 22. I cut this girl off 4 months ago for being toxic towards me. At first we went our separate ways. She began outright bullying me out of no where. I’ve ignored it. 

A month ago I noticed my absolute best friend being friendly with her. Knowing the things she was doing to me and saying about me. It took a lot in me to cut my best friend off but I did. I didn’t tell her why because I didn’t want to come off as controlling. I just let her go. At the end of the day everyone is entitled to being friends with whoever. It does hurt though. I lost my appetite for the longest. I finally picked myself back up 2 weeks ago. Started going to the gym again and focusing on me. It was going okay. 

Tonight I have seen the last of my friends befriend her. They all know what she did and is continuing to do to me. They all know the bullying she puts me through. And I just look like a fucking door mat ignoring it. My last couple friends man. I feel my appetite shifting again. My stomach is doing flips. I finally had a group of people who I believed finally  took a liking to me after being picked on my whole life. Seeing the way they are friendly with her just shattered my whole heart tonight.

"TLDR: I’m dying alone and that’s it.


I know no one could give two shits but oh well here I go. I know that when it’s all said and done, when I’m finally dead, no one will care. I’m a lonely, miserable cunt bag who can’t be a decent social person for 5 minutes. No one other than my family loves me, even then its only close family which consists of 7 people max. I know what will happen towards the end of my life. Everyone I know will die or forget me and I die alone. That’s all. I know I won’t make more friends or find a partner. No matter what anyone says, the lines of “everything happens for a reason” or “good things will always come after bad things” are pure lies made by those who are more fortunate. Every time I see people out with people with someone else they are clearly happy and content with, I feel hollow and jelous. I want someone to love me, but I know I don’t deserve it. I’m a horrible person so maybe this is a punishment."

"Yeah I'm always called weird. I try to approach guys and they will often say something to hurt me probably to push me away. 

The other day at work for example. Me and this coworker are friends and she talks to x coworker sometimes that I mostly work with. He is nice to her. But towards me is not as nice and uses sarcasm and not chatty. Another coworker was trying to play matchmaker with me and him. I know HS nonsense and sad to see that from 30+ year olds. An item was lost from the workplace and the guy immediately suspended me of hiding it or taking it. I was so pissed. Yeah he ended apologizing after it was found but doesn't change the fact that he accused me. He said he was joking. Then tried to say I am weird because I'm interested so much in his country of origin since I was talking about.

"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this in. I'd appreciate redirections if it's not.

CW: mentions of self-harm and disordered eating.

I've been feeling so exhausted and down lately. Been considering recovering from my disordered eating because it would be nice to have actual meals and be able to exercise. But it doesn't feel bad enough to warrant recovery, not nearly bad enough. I can't feel much until something small happens and I'm overwhelmed, and it causes me to harm myself again. I want to do well for my finals in a month or two, but am struggling to feel motivated. I'm isolating myself from my parents and online friends. Everything feels so wrong and at the same time, it doesn't feel wrong enough to tell anyone in real life. I'll do my best to cheer up and be productive tomorrow, but it's so difficult right now. I don't even know what to think, time is passing so slowly and so fast. I want to cheer up and study, I wish I could eat some oatmeal or banana in the morning, wish I could go on long walks.

I have always been the quiet kid that didn’t talk at all at school, and had very little friends. I found it hard to talk, mainly because I was afraid. My middle/ elementary school went to 8th grade, so my 9th grade year I started at a different school along with some other kids I knew. I was still the shy kid that didn’t talk, but I was trying to change to fit in with the rest of the kids as I got older. No one really took me seriously and I got bullied some times. Mainly making fun of me, which normally doesn’t hurt. But listening to it every day starts to get to you. I never talked to any new guys besides the ones I already knew, but there was a girl that was nice. I sat beside her in Spanish class, not that it mattered, but for some reason she always wanted to talk to me. Now, even thought this was only a year ago, I have changed a lot and looked back at what was really going on. I, at the time had no realization that any girl would ever want to talk to me at all, given I had some pretty bad acne and I was a little overweight.  And I kept telling myself that.  But, trying to fit in with the other boys in my class, I moved my seat away because they kept making fun of me sitting beside her. I never stood up for myself, I was awkward. That was basically all that happened  in 9 th grade. A little small talk but not much. I was still shy and afraid to talk to her.

The school year ended and over the summer I got into lifting and taking better care of myself. I went back to school that fall and the first day of school I was waiting in the lunch line when she came up and started talking to me. Now, over the summer, I matured a little more and actually truly realized girls, which sounds really stupid, but it’s the only way I can describe it. Anyway, I was more nervous than the year before, mainly because I could tell the was definitely not an unattractive girl and looked a whole lot different than I did. I was so scared, and this was only about 6 months ago. We talked a little between classes, and I still didn’t fully realize what was going on. She would track me down in the hallways between class just to get a few sentences in. I would always catch her looking at me. Now, right about that time was a few weeks before thanksgiving. One day I was off guard and for some reason when she tried to talk to me, I froze. I just stood there. So anyway, I messed that up, but instead of just saying something, me still telling myself lies and reasons not to talk to her and laugh it off as a mistake, I didn’t say anything for three weeks. For three weeks. I was planing on refocusing after I got back from break, #2 event happened. My grandfather passed away. This messed me up and I still feel it to this day. I haven’t been the same. So I didn’t talk to her again, and again, over and over for months. And passing by in the hallways feels horrible. I took those few months in a deep state of what I would say is depression. I stopped going to the gym. I went from all a’s and b’s to b’s and c’s. I started to recover and got back to the gym. I changed my hair and started using medicines for my acne which has been clearing up. But for some reason this week I did a full 180 and have regretted what I’ve done. I still don’t know why I was afraid to talk to her. It’s sinking in how much of a mistake I made. All at once. Months after. Sure I knew I messed up when it happened, but just yesterday and today, I had something really strange happen. It just kindove sunk in as I saw her through the day, I can’t sleep, I don’t want to eat. I have even started randomly shaking and have the chills. Why is this happening? 
Sorry to make you read all this. If you need any more explanations you can just message me. I have no one else to talk to. I miss my grandpa and I don’t know how to fix this at all."
"This is my first post, so forgive me if it’s a bit strange. It’s also a bit of a long read

I guess to jump right into it, I’ve been abused and molested for a vast majority of my life. I lost my virginity sometime before four to my brother, who is six years older than me. I don’t remember it, I just know that’s the first time my mom caught him. He didn’t stop until he was kicked out of the house for unrelated reasons when I was 10.

When I was 8, we moved across the country to live with my new stepdad, who my mom met online gaming. We fought a lot, but it was a fairly normal father/daughter relationship, aside from the fact that he was always super strict and controlling. One night when I was 11, my mother insisted we sit down and talk out our differences. We had been fighting too much, and she wanted us to make up. We sat on my bed and talked all night, even after she came by to check up on us and let us know she was headed to bed.

Then he turned the lights out, which at the time I guess I assumed was to be considerate to my sister in the next room, as I was banned from a door and the light might wake her. Things became strange from there. He started telling me stories if his past sexual experiences, and personal details about my mother and his sex life.

Then he asked about my brother. My mother kept what happened a secret from him, and though he had assumed, he was never sure. I told him the words the adults told me, but that I didn’t really understand. He told me he could help me understand what happened and work past it, and how awful of a person my brother was. He then proceeded to molest me himself. 

For a few days, I believed him when he said he was doing it for my own good, and just trying to educate me. I realized I didn’t want to know anymore, and I told him I wanted to stop. He said “no,” and stood up in the doorway and said I couldn’t leave. Over the years, he would say that I “had” to sleep with him for one reason or another. 

We moved across the country again and ended up in a literal shack in the middle of the woods with no neighbors, no indoor plumbing, and the only electricity coming from a generator we had to sparingly use. He started secretly making me bargain for the family’s generator time, and sometimes would tell me that if I told anyone, he would leave and we would be destitute. He also said my mother would be devastated and wouldn’t be able to recover, as she had a lot of childish tendencies and was really in love with him.

He eventually left for unrelated reasons and I told my mother. He moved back across the country to live with his parents and I was going to visit him one last time for summer vacation, as I made the plans and got the plane tickets before I told my mom, and I preferred that side of the country and wanted time away from my mother. The summer vacation before when I visited, he raped me in the next room from his parents, which I wasn’t prepared for because I thought he at least wouldn’t there. This year, I assumed he would try the same and was able to successfully reject him and avoid his advances. 

To get away from my mother, he talked me into moving in and having his parents adopt me. I did, and he would continuously try to take control when they were home and beg me to sleep with him when they were away. He was kicked out a few weeks later due to constantly fighting for control and causing problems, but I feel like he has ruined my enjoyment of sex permanently.

Since he left, I’ve had a series of bad experiences with men who won’t take “no” for an answer, some friends and some exes. I was forced into sex a lot of times when I lived in the middle of nowhere because I would spend time with boys I trusted alone and they would drive me into the middle of nowhere so I couldn’t escape and force me into sex, then calling me a slut in school later.

I had various experiences with friends where they coerced me into drinking and then forced themselves on me, only to apologize later. Most of the men I date stop caring about my consent after awhile. I have dated several men that would continue even when I was crying and saying “no.” They’re always altogether nice and charming outside of that, and don’t show signs of this until we’ve been dating/been friends for awhile. 

Even when sex is consensual, I feel unable to enjoy it. I’m constantly aware of every little thing that’s happening, I disassociate uncontrollably midway through, and I just feel exposed and like I have to focus everything in me to feel good. 

I just want to have a normal sex life with someone who respects me, and I realize that I seek out unhealthy relationships, but as it’s unintentional and often not realized until after the fact, I don’t know how to avoid it. Even worse, it makes me feel dirty and wrong with the people I date, and I often compulsively try to have more sex than I actually want, or pretend I enjoy it more than I do, to not offend who I’m with. I use sex as a tool to get to the hearts of the men I’m dating because I don’t know what a normal sexual relationship should be. I’m just so lost."

"I don't know why I keep attracting men who just want to fool around. I get guys talking to me a lot and later on they bring up their gf or wife. I work a lot of catering events in California and I meet many attractive guys and they actually pick me to talk with and they end up mentioning a gf. Even after some bantering. I assume they just do it for their ego which is sad. It doesn't necessarily hurts me but it annoys me and makes me angry. I don't have much of a social life and I work a lot or do other things. I tried apps and it seems majority is catfish and they don't have plans to meet in person. Or if they do they make it clear is for sex. 

There is someone I like at my workplace which yeah, most people say is a bad idea but I don't work a job I really like, it's just a server job at a hotel. Not a career. We got a new boss about 3 months ago and while we started in bad terms, we made up. He always approaches me to talk and teases me. Even said how good looking and young looking he is but he told me later on he is joking. I dunno if he necessarily flirts with me or he acts that way so I do what he says. But some of his comments have been weird, like he borrowed my keycard and returned it and I said how I thought he would lose it and he answered how I will never lose him from my life. Then he gets mad with me making plans with male workers to go gamble. Last week he told me how he doesn't want to see me drinking around him and alcohol is not good for me and I asked him who is he to say that, my dad? He frowned at calling him dad and then I said OK, are you my husband then? He told me not today. 

Yesterday he saw me as he was coming in and greeted me and said how nice that I am the first person he sees. He commented on my make-up how beautiful it looks. The guy is in his 50s and he was married for like 13 years or so but divorced within the past 2 years or so. We connect well but I dunno if he is fooling with me.

"Hi. I'm 27, and I am autistic and still live with my parents, and honestly I couldn't imagine NOT living with them. But this is a problem I have, which is getting me really quite down. And has been going on since I was a kid to be honest. I was never allowed to wear things like miniskirts etc. But the thing is, I really love Japanese and Korean street fashion, and want to dress like how cute anime girls dress. My mum will sometimes get me cute Japanese and Korean clothes. But literally every time I wear them, either her or my dad have to make a comment or ask a question that embarrasses me or makes me uncomfortable. Once my dad commented on these flowy shorts I was wearing when I was about to go to the shop, and I got so angry and upset that I just ended up not going.

Every time I wear shorts or a skirt or dress, they ask ""you are wearing underwear, right?"" When I don't want the topic of my underwear brought up.

It happened recently too. The other day I was going to a singing workshop, and I was wearing this long sleeved grey shirt which had some white lacing on the shoulders and upper back. There was literally nothing revealing about it, and my mum had a problem with it. She told me I had to wear something under it, even though it was only laced on the SHOULDERS and UPPER BACK. And then 2 days ago, I was wearing an outfit which was a stripey black and white dress, which is short, because it's supposed to be like that for the style, and with navy leggings. And my mum told me it was too short and the leggings are too see-through, and kept calling them tights when they are leggings. This is an outfit I've worn many times before without issue. And it upset me so much when I went to choir I didn't try as hard as usual I was quiet, and even one of the other members told me some advice to not slouch and not have my shoulders forward, and not look down etc. But the reason I was doing that was because I was in a bad mood because of what my mum said. It has ruined my mood for that day, and also even today it's still bothering me.

She thinks she's protecting me from something by saying these things, when it's damaging my self-esteem, and making me dread wearing my favourite outfits. She told me she wants me to wear trousers from now on, but I don't WANT to because I want to wear my cute Japanese and Korean fashion, and I feel less cute and feminine in trousers or tomboyish styles. I like to feel pretty and feminine, but I also don't want to have these comments anymore. What can I do? This is really really getting to me, even though it's probably stupid, but it's REALLY getting to me. It's making me not look forward to going to choir now, because wearing those nice outfits was one of the reasons I look forward to going every week, because I never get other chances to wear them. "

i hope in another parallel universe she is alive and happy. i can't even look at pictures otherwise id add one. i don't really know why i'm posting on here but if even one person sends her soul some love i guess it's worth it. i don't believe in god but this is one of those times where i wish i did.

I am looking for emotional support to help me process a traumatic event. People around my age (17-20) are preferred if possible. Please message me if anyone is willing to listen to me vent or help me feel better from this really upsetting event. 

  
Thank you so much &lt;33"
"I've been there before, just wanting someone to listen without judgement, so I want to do the same for others. I've suffered depression, anxiety, and I also have ADHD - so I definitely know what it's like to struggle with your own mind on a daily basis. 

I have a lot of time on my hands right now so I'm happy to chat with anyone, about anything at all. Please, reach out if you would like to 🩷

And if this post is still up I’m still offering to listen 🙂 "
"Today is my 20th birthday and I'm spending it pretty much entirely alone and I'm really upset about it. I spent my birthday last year alone as well, but this feels like a very monumental birthday for me, and I've been really looking forward to turning 20 and I've felt for a long time like good things will come from it. A couple of weeks ago I moved into my first proper apartment with a close friends of mine and assumed that an even semi eventful birthday would come out of that, it did not. My parents couldn't even come and visit me. None of my other friends have the time to talk to me today. I'm just feeling very alone in the universe. 

I figured maybe I'd just come here, talk about my day, maybe tell a little bit about myself. Just anything to feel like a person that exists today. On Wednesday I'm going into my 3rd year of university, I'm a music composition major. I love music A LOT, I'm remarkably passionate and driven and I want nothing more than to make incredible music for others to enjoy. My 2nd greatest passion is television, my favorite show is Six Feet Under. It makes me sometimes wish that I'd gone into writing and directing instead, which is why I plan to try to make music for tv some day. I play a lot of video games, my love of rich stories translates much into this as I play a lot of story based games. I'm gay!!!!! I'm a big time lesbian and it plays a big role in my identity and who I am as a person. 

I deserve to be celebrated, I deserve to feel loved, I deserve to have a fun birthday. Hopefully next year. "
"Any time I am left alone I start crying. I feel so awful and I really don’t know what to do. I don’t even think I’d feel better if I had more friends or a relationship. I either feel empty or pure despair. These feelings have been going on for months. I’m starting therapy next week but I don’t see how it or anything else could help. I really wish I could just die and have everyone forget about me but I know how upset my mom would be so I can’t. That’s the only reason I’m still here. I just wish there was a way to make the pain stop. I imagine any possible future, whether positive or negative, and feel a deep pit in my stomach when I realize that it would change nothing."
"hello, i am a female. men from my culture look down on me because i am a woman. some explicitly declare this, others indirectly show it through their words and actions. mind you, i am always the higher educated, richer, higher skilled one while interacting with any of them. i am tired of being talked to in a condescending way. please advise me.

"I lost my car in an accident. The person won’t admit fault so I’m scared I’ll be sued. I’m financing a new (used) car now so I have new bills. My job that I used to love so much seems like they’re replacing me now. No other job is hiring right now. I’m still on the look out but every place I call says they’re taking applications but not hiring. I’m not getting enough hours anymore. All my savings are gone because I needed a new car. I have 2 tests for 911 dispatch on the 18 and the 20th. My birthday is on the 19th, I’ll be turning 23. I have nothing to my name I lost everything. I want to take myself out so bad. 
My only safe space was work and I don’t have that anymore. 
Even if I do get into my career field in 911 dispatch, I’ll still be a slave because they overwork the fuck out of you. That’s no way to live. I DONT WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE. "
I've been depressed for a long time but it's hitting me hard lately. In short I'm 27 and I'm super depressed about being such a loser and the depression hits me super hard at night especially lately. I'm going back to therapy soonish. But until then the nights are going to be scary bad. I'm so fucking scared. I can't explain it but night time just really triggers my depression hard. So every night is a terrifying rollercoaster. 
"Too many bad thoughts 

Too much sadness 

Too much loneliness

No real plan for improvement 

Don’t want things to get worse

I hope it isn’t

"Lately life's been beating the hell out of me. I don't know what to do what or where to turn and honestly part of me just wants to end it.. I have a girlfriend I been with for 3 years and i love her unconditionally, But shes cheated on me Before and the first time I forgave her because it was when we first got together. Then again about a year or so ago she gave me her old phone when mine broke but forgot to reset it...  And she was messing around again with a couple people at that, she said she only slept with the one guy and the other ones she only was talking to them on phone not seeing them in person... I guess that's called emotionally cheating, Like talking about wanting each other and all that other bullshit... Well I forgave her AGAIN and she swore it would never happen again blah blah blah.. Well lately she's been acting suspicious, don't want me know her phone password she says if you wanna see or use my phone we can do it together!!!?? And like a month ago I went on her phone and there was a message from someone I thought was my friend saying ""I want you but I have company over"", so she says ""I'm at my friends house right now so is your company staying long?"" But she swears that she didn't mean it like that but how else could you mean it??!?!? And there was people who I thought was our friends that I know she texts at least every other day so there should be messages between them but the message threads empty so she deff deleted em... but again she says no I didn't blah blah and then every time she would go somewhere she will be gone for like 3-4 hours when before recently the same things would have taken nowhere near that long. Or she will go somewhere to do someone a favor like ""babysit her friends son"" so she says (Not to mention he is like 13 he don't need no babysitter during the day for hour or two).Or to help her friend clean up her yard, or whatever she says she's supposed doing that again should take no more then 3-4 hours and she will be gone literally 7-8 hours a couple times it was 12 HOURS!!!! Well about a week ago the ""friend"" I said texted her saying I want you, and me started arguing we weren't getting along so he's texting me talking shit... And what do you know he sends me a 3 second video and it's my girlfriend sucking a dick!!!!!! that damn sure ain't mine and then says and I should still fuck you up blah blah blah so obviously it's her sucking his dick and that explains the text I found.... Well I confront her and she says thats got to be a old video he must of stole a old phone of mine or got into my accounts and stole that video..... Really??? That sounds so fucking stupid.... But it hurts so I just been dwelling on it on top of everything else and I wish I could just say fuck you and leave but idk why I can't I still fucking love her so much and don't want it to be true but it is and I'm sooo fucking lost... Because obviously she's a straight cheater right??? Someone please give me some advice!! It's been eating at me and killing me I'm so depressed I just lay in bed all day and hate my life I don't find joy in nothing no more... I have no motivation or energy to do shit.... Please help "
"

I’m 18 M- my parents used to always complain that I stayed in the house too much especially during covid and stuff bc I would just stay in and play the game all day long. But now as an 18 year old, they say I go out too much and they want me to stay in- they don’t even think about why I go out so much- it’s bc I hate being home, every time I’m home I’m getting yelled at about something. There’s not one day where they don’t yell at me for something. My mom’s only texts to me this summer have been to yell at me, and not even just then it’s been a lot like that for a while. I go out to get away from it all and I’m punished🤦🏾"

"Last year I got my first ever girlfriend. We had been best friends for two years at that point and we fell in love. We were deeply in love with each other and I was so happy. All my life I had to deal with being made fun of for how nerdy and ugly I am. I’ve been told insanely hurtful things, like I’m the ugliest person in the entire school and that I would never be able to get a girlfriend. I’ve been called fat so many times, I can’t even count it. There was one person that said I don’t get fat shamed enough, but even though it still hurt, it didn’t matter because I finally got a pretty, loving, caring girlfriend. We were the cutest couple. We had so much in common. It’s like we were made for each other, like genuinely. But then my own personal problems happened. So for context my mother passed away when I was 7, and I’m 17 now. I didn’t realize it until about a year or two ago but I realized that there was a huge void missing in my life. After my mother passed I craved the attention and affection that only a female could give me, and when my girlfriend gave me that, I went overboard and I became a terrible person to her. I would incriminate her for being uncomfortable with things like asking for hugs and putting my arm around her and stuff like that. I said and did some terrible things but yet I was in love with her, and she was in love with me. Although she was in love with me, she could only be so patient, and she couldn’t take all the hurt it was bringing her, and she had to break up with me. It crushed me, but it made me a better person. I learned from my mistakes and I know how to act now, but the problem is, I lost the love of my life, and I miss her SO much. I can’t even explain how in love with her I am. After we broke up, we proceeded to have the single most toxic friendship I’ve ever seen in my entire life. It’s like one day we were besties and the other we were blood enemies. It was so bad. There was one time during her birthday when she didn’t use any of my gifts that I bought during her birthday, which I had been planning for several months and I spent so much time and money, and I even donated some of my blood in a blood drive so I could get an Amazon gift card to use for more money towards her birthday gifts, but we got into a terrible argument two days before her birthday and I had a mental breakdown and I said some crazy things, and she didn’t want to talk to me and she didn’t want my gifts. She later told me that she felt that she didn’t deserve them because how could I say she made me feel that way and then turn around and give her gifts. It devastated me that she did that. As of a few weeks ago, she doesn’t even want to talk to me. She says she doesn’t even want to be my friend. She said she can’t be the friend she thinks I deserve, and maybe when she thinks she’s ready, maybe she’ll come back and want a friendship again. I’m so alone. She was my only friend and the only person I felt truly cared about me. Now I’m depressed and alone and I cry all the time. I just want love. I’m so ugly and unattractive, and I want to change everything about myself to be attractive to somebody and loved by somebody. I just get attached to people so quickly and it makes me feel like such an idiot to think that someone would even care about me and love me. I have such low self-esteem and I want to be cared about."

"I'm just on the urge of crying 24/7, I don't have a drivers license, don't have a job nor a car and I did terrible on high school only taking easy classes. Because I overthink about everything I should be doing I end up doing nothing. That includes personal projects and even hobbies...   I also did terrible on high school and only took one AP class the entire time, absolutely 0 hard classes. I have stopped working out and drawing. 
 Everyone around me seems to be moving forward and I'm still just sitting here. 
 I'm trying to improve but it just feels so late and I start to cry just thinking about it.. I don't even understand why my friends like being around me, it just feels like shit "
"I can't let him go; I hold on to him so tightly. In the smallest gestures, I seek hope that everything will work out. I can't accept that he has already made his choice. It hurts me that this relationship is ending because it just has to be that way. We are now in a state of suspension because I lose my mind without him. I don't want to be alone. Besides him, I have no friends or anyone around. He neither pushes me away nor draws me closer, and that's the worst feeling. I can't let him go. I constantly beg for his affection, attention, interest, and love.

I feel like complete shit, I hate myself, the way I look, who I am. I have no one by my side. My life is just work, gym, and then loneliness, crying, despair... I can't cope, I can't sleep, I don't know what to do. They say time heals everything, but every day I'm falling apart more and more... I'm thinking about just leaving"
"I adopted an outdoor cat when a neighbor abandoned her after moving out. I tried very hard to house train her, but she would have none of it. In spite of this, she’d never leave the property and always stayed within a few meters of the house. I fell in love with her and she’s brought me so much joy over the years. A few days ago she disappeared and there is no trace of her in the vicinity. She’s never done this before and didn’t show any irregular behavior, but she’s a senior cat and I have a gut feeling may have wandered off to die in solitude. I just hope she didn’t suffer. I’ve shared posters online which has only been met with hemming and hawing about her picture being outside. I lost my best friend and could use some compassion. "
Today is the day of my birthday party that ive been planning since February. I invited 3 friends to go to busch gardens with me and 2 have them cancelled last second which left me with one friend going with me. I had asked them multiple times to confirm they will be there and this still happened. So now im sitting here with my friend not talking because were both too anxious and honestly im trying not to cry because id feel bad. But this is pretty upsetting because this was going to my first birthday party with friends in a while
Ok so i dont feel comfortable asking any person I know irl so im coming here. I was at class with my friends and one of them started to like rub his foot against my leg and on my foot (only below the knee) at the time i found it funny cause we joke like that but i recently found out he has a girlfriend and thinking about day just makes me feel gross (it didnt happen long ago) i just dont know what to do. Idk why this makes me so uncomfortable 
"I have some friends wishing me happy birthday but my bestfriends haven't said anything. My parents haven't said anything either. It's 12.06 pm where i live.

My birthday is mine and i deserve to have a good day. Tell me what should I do? I'm working from 9am to 9pm today. "

"So, it's been two months since i broke up with my girlfriend. The reason was because i simply woke up and couldn't say for sure if i loved her. This went on for months and months, so it felt right to end things, even if i wasn't sure if i should. Now I can't take her off my head, everything little fucking thing makes me think about her, my face, my hair, my voice, everything. I want her back, she's great, and even when i was breaking with her, I didn't knew why i was ending things with such an amazing girl. So, with that said, if i want her back, i should ask for another chance, right? I want to, but I don't know why. Thinking about reattaching with her makes me anxious, relieved and hesitant all at the same time. I really hate the idea of her moving on without me, but at the same time, this thought makes some voice reeeeally far away sigh in relief, because she could forget me and wasn't hurt anymore. I don't know what to do, think or how i should proceed with this. I just feel that im losing her day by day, at the same time im forgetting her day by day. I don't know why i want her back, and that terrify me, because im really scared of getting back and hurting her again. We are both 17 btw. We are also 3 hours away from each other,  that distance was something that made me rethink my feelings for her on that months we were still together. I don't know if im just venting, but any advice would be great, im really lost"
"CW: Talk about suicide 

Idk what L or O is for sorry. Just a rant

Sorry about the alt account. I’m permanently banned from Reddit. Anyways, read if you want idc I just need to get this off my chest real quick. I want to kill myself. I have a belt because my work uniform requires it. I also have a knife. I was waiting until I could somehow get a shotgun or something but I don’t know how long I can take this anymore. 19 years of hell. My father died when I was like 4-5 years old. 14 years without a father figure. I may still be functional but I basically lost most of the experience of my life because he’s gone. I don’t know where to hang myself. I’ll probably get black lash for this (but I’m on an alt and will log out of this account soon I made a fake email and password without looking) but, this is embarrassing, I consider myself to be feminine. I’m a male, but I live with my mom and bother. I would like to paint my nails and dress feminine and whatnot but I can’t because I’m closeted and I guess I fucking won’t experience that. It doesn’t matter anyway. I lost my dad, most of my life experience was gone even before I was old enough. I’ll also lose the (possible) experience of not getting a significant other but, it doesn’t matter. Really nothing else matters anymore. I’m still hanging on to life but I’m about ready to give up. almost every day I wish to die. I work in security and some guy one day threatened my coworker with a gun. I wish he threatened me so I could just say please shoot me already. Jesus Christ even if I DO somehow live, I don’t get to fully experience life. It doesn’t matter though. I just want the abyss or whatever is on the other side even if it is a place for unbelievers according to my mom. I used to be a Christian but I’m not anymore. Won’t get into that so there won’t be some fight in the comments if anyone cares idk. On February 14th 2024 I told myself I’ll kill myself on February 14th 2025. I might end up doing it sooner or whatever. Wanna know what’s funny? Whenever one of my friends wants to die I tell them please don’t but then I go and be suicidal. I’m so stupid. I don’t know anymore. I just don’t. This world is just going to shit. My shift begins in about 5 hours. Was planning to shower soon but I don’t think I have enough motivation. Just wanna stay in bed. I hope I die tonight or tomorrow or soon. Maybe a nuke from ww3 or something idk. Whatever. Sorry for the wall of text, I don’t expect anyone to read it anyway. Just trying to get my thoughts out. Also it’s to the point I’m so lonely I heavily spite ANYONE with a SO. Jesus I’m so pathetic. Even a mere mention of, you can laugh idc, femboys or anything gets me suicidal because I know it’s basically impossible for me to get like that. I’m like 195 pounds anyway. Used to be 220 I guess but I’m starting to give up on weight loss because lack of motivation. Honestly that’s the hard part of all this. Lack of motivation. Whatever. Guess I’m done here. I rather post this before Reddit bans this account or something. I’m gonna be a bit annoyed if I’m not allowed to post this because my account is new but, even if so, I’m feeling a bit better now. Ugh. I guess I should mention, if you need someone to talk to I guess, my telegram is @Some_Random_Guy57. I’m willing to be there for you if you need me. Might as well try to save a stranger before I die. "
I feel that.
I have no friends lol
"I've never really been afraid of death. If anything I was ok with dying as long as I achieved everything I wanted in the world. However even though I still think I'll be ok with passing away, I'm honestly kinda afraid to. Because I don't know whether I'll forget everything I experienced, and the people I met along the way and my family who took care of me. which i don't want to forget because my family, my friends, my experiences meant so much to me that I can't even explain it fully. I only started to fear what happens after death because of my grandmother. She was a very kind and strong woman. She was also wise and she honestly the one who gave me most of the attention when I was growing up. Because my  mother was busy working even though my grandmother said that she should give me attention and spend time with me which my mother declined. And for my father he lived in a different country to make money and come back every once in a while and stay as long as he could.

Now I cared about my grandmother alot so it shocked me and devastated me that she died. I was so heartbroken that I could not live the same anymore, and I mean NOT the same anymore. 
She meant alot to me and rhe worst part of it all. I knew she was going to die. Basically she wasn't doing well when it came to health and when she was in her worst, I saw all the signs that she was going to die. My parents reassured me saying she would be just fine, saying she would make it. And I tried to believe it and I did. But the signs were clear considering she needed to be put in a machine that would make her breathe while unconscious. And as you may have guessed when she died I wax very, very heart broken. It didn't help that I was a very kind kid, very caring too. After this happened I started to go down in a a spiral of grief that I would never be able to get out of quickly. Because grief is not something you get over. It's something you learn to cope with.
Regardless my 4 years would be a shithole. It didn't help either that I was 14 at the time. Which I meant I knew her for a long time. And I had a very good connection with her. I care about her so much. She was everything. And later I would become depressed,  seeing no meaning in life and yet still tried to be optimistic because I couldn't let myself get beat down but I did to some extent. My grades got worse gradually because I didn't care anymore about my education and homework. I just wanted to grief. That's all I wanted. Just let life give me some space. For at least 1 year, maybe 2. But I couldn't have that. So instead I was only given one month off of school. Which wasn't enough for me as you may have guessed. As the years grew by I got worse and worse until my fourth year where I would I guess be ok... but I just don't care about homework still and if I'm being honest I just don't want to do it. Even though I don't feel depressed anymore. I just don't feel the same. Every went so fast. Too fast.

And while I went through life I started to realise what was my biggest fear. Forgetting. I didn't want to forget the experiences and the people that I loved deeply. I didn't want to lose that. This made me view life even worse. Am I just supposed to make all these connections just to die and be in a new body and forget my previous experiences? I didn't want that. So I became more sad and I started to grief more. Wishing that I could just have all the people I know live forever. Stay forever. Or at least if i had the choice to relive my life. I would do that. And if not that then at least stay in the afterlife forever with the people I care about or be in a new body and still have my memories, even though I would prefer to not just have my old memories but also still have the same people I love around me. I just don't want to lose everything I knew. I'm afraid and I'm scared. I don't want to lose anything. It makes me want to cry knowing that I might not remember any of this, or be born with the same family and have the same friends. It makes me want to cry. I know this is probably silly since why should i fear the unknown if we know nothing what will happen after we die. And people will probably call Me silly but I just can't help it. When you are like me who cares about the people you love so much, how could you not be like me?

Look what I'm asking is how do I cope with this. How do I get my life back around. How do I just live like this? How can I live normally again? Please tell me...
If you can't do that then at least all I'm asking is comfort... that is all."
"A little context. 15 year professional comedian, never acquired commercial success. Extremely positive (on the outside). Always involved in my local community. Put on fundraisers for families who lost their homes in a fire. Running a story scavenger hunt for Family Day teaching children about storytelling in a creative and interactive way. I never let my lack of commercial success keep me down. Continue a spirit of resilience. In the name of ""staying realistic"" with my career and future, I shifted my energy away from my individual brand and focused on a small business that uses comedy as a learning tool for teams and small groups. It's a form of play-based education that took me 10 months to initially develop. I bootstrapped my small business and took a bunch of risks to get it off the ground. It hasn't gained traction. I've gone flat broke. I managed to tarnish my closest relationships in the process. Yes, I'm left feeling defeated, fully knowing I can always push forward. If I really rabbit-holed into what I've overcome so far, it's a lot, so I know I'm capable of doing hard things and going through hard times. But it's been a decade and a half of nonstop thanklessness, nonstop rejection, nonstop judgement. I'm just tired. My son has been recently diagnosed with autism and I'm really reflecting if all this sacrifice is really worth it in the end. I like to think my efforts and my positive attitude will compound over time but the reality is a little harsher. As it stands, I'm not even a footnote in my own industry and I love comedy. I love it more than anything, to the point where I advocate for comedy in education, consistently mentor new comedians and help my more-successful friends prepare for their specials and tours. I never saw myself as a ""quitter"" but I'm tired. I'm really really tired and I feel like a loser if I'm being perfectly honest. To try so hard, for so long, and come out of it with very little progress, is a bit a heart-sinker. The idea of pivoting, leaving this life, becoming reclusive and cut-off seems most attractive right now. To just be with my son, build learning programs for him, help him develop, and just stay in and write, work a low-end job, keep my head down and play out my days. That's where my head's at. It doesn't seem like a bad life. It seems peaceful to me. A friend of mine discourages this greatly. He tells me I'm a force for good and my intentions are pure and there are very few people like me in our industry. I agree with him but at the same time, I don't know what else I have in the tank. Feel like tapping out and just disappearing. I feel embarrassed and humiliated by the life I chose for myself though it was about bringing joy to others and taking chances, betting on myself, and showing others that having a dream is a beautiful thing. But that dream feels so far away now. I feel greatly misunderstood. I don't think I'm understood as an act, I'm not understood as an entrepreneur and I'm not understand as a free thinker. My ideas are often rejected though they are always efforts around improving human communication, improving human gathering experiences and improving our relationships with one another. I'm not looking for answers but I am looking for conversation. Just someone to talk to, to listen, to ask me questions. I think for once in my life I'm going to finally tap and I don't know what life will look like after that. It's either for the very best, or the very worst, I won't know until I do it. But yeah, this is my first post here. Seems like a cool community. Thanks for reading. "

"Hi there. If you're feeling blue, feeling gray, red-hot with anger, or even green with envy (never realized how many color-related idioms for emotions there were), I'm here to listen, give advice, or simply spew out random facts and ridiculous jokes that may make you smile.

The only caveat is that you're patient with me if I do not reply right away. (Life is busy for us all).

I just wanted to get this off my chest. Im currently 17 years old and i feel like an idiot. I often mess up things because unknowingly today i ruined a shirt i had been excited to get with a marker that somehow did have the cap on it. This honestly makes me hate myself any mistake i make it makes me hate myself more i start to think that i dont deserve the stuff ive been given due to how stupid i am. My parents are willing to give me a lot of stuff and im so great full but whenever i mess up like that it makes me feel like i dont deserve all ive gotten.

"I can't see it getting any better any time soon. Life is fading darker than the black it's been. I don't have the drive, energy or motivation for anything. I don't have any meaningful connections irl. Nothing really makes me happy or satisfied anymore. Life is completely bland and colorless.

I've been trying to change for so long. I don't have it in me to go on any longer. I'm depressed, anxious and burntout all the time. Been working on my mental comorbities but still. Change is painfully slow but I don't think I can push through.

I am growing increasingly cynical and resentful of people and life in general. They say you're not alone, but nobody knows me. They say mental health is important, yet you only deserve professional support if you're priveleged enough to live in a first world country that has options for you, or can afford it. 

What's the point of living a life where you live just to ""get through"" all the time. My supressed thoughts of death have come back full force."

"I have been feeling so low recently. I keep making mistakes and I am a slow learner.

A few months ago I had a disciplinary meeting for this shitty retail job I had for selling alcohol to someone I shouldn’t have. As if that job didn’t trigger my anxiety enough, that was a major trigger. Yes, I shouldn’t have done it. But I am allowed to talk about how it affected me. My manager kept insulting me on my last day, asking if I’m like this in every job I have, how will I do other jobs (I’ve a law degree), and ‘I think you’ll be like this in every job you have’. This was incredibly personal but I just took it because I understood I made a mistake. I didn’t make excuses. I just took it on. I wish I quit before the meeting, because I didn’t need the job anyway.

Not only has this ruined the little confidence it has it also ruined my confidence to be applying for jobs. My thinking is, even if I do get a job, I will make mistakes like this and get fired. Her words keep repeating in my head. I want to work in a law firm, but I’d probably leak something confidential or make a mistake and get fired. I’m also interested in working with young children but I’m too clumsy to be able to take care of them. I can’t do anything.

After I left that day she texted me to ask if I could email a resignation letter probably for the procedural matters but I ignored it because I didn’t owe her anything. Also, she reduced my hours after it.

I’ve also had a lot of driving lessons and I still can’t do it. I’m very below average. I’m not the brightest but you definitely don’t need to be the brightest to pass. But I feel defeated. I spent so much money on this. I get anxious

I called my Dr to get anxiety medication, I was told this was only if you tried therapy first and if it was impacting your day to day life. Maybe I should try therapy. But I just wanted to take something to feel better.

Based on my life experience (check my post history for more mistakes I made), I feel that I have low IQ. Honestly. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I haven’t interacted with society as much as I could have done in the past few years. And I’m scared of confrontation. 

How do I become sharper?"
"I have tried to commit suicide a few times in the past and wasn't even close to dying. I'm afraid of the dying process. I'm writing this because the suicide hotlines and ers are not good, I can't explain why. I'm sorry to everyone that Im a failure and that I'm not good enough and haven't tried hard enough. I'm scared and I'm fucking sorry. I wish that I wasn't worthless."
"Warning: one part of this post is kinda disgusting tbh

&amp;nbsp;

So I’m in a wheelchair and have been for the last 4.5 years. I’m not paralyzed or anything, but I sustained a severe brain injury from a car crash 4.5 years ago and still have a lot of muscle weakness and tightness. I had to have a lot of surgeries because apparently your muscles become deformed when you sustain a brain injury. I’ve experienced pain that would drive some people insane, and have had to put thousands and thousands of hours of effort into physical, occupational, and speech therapy.

My mind is a mess too. I had severe depression prior to my injury, and apparently it’s somehow gotten much worse. I’m too scared to open up to anyone or even see a therapist though so I’m just left here silently suffering while acting like the happiest and most upbeat person.

And if all of this wasn’t bad enough, the fact that I’m in a wheelchair makes things so much harder too (warning: this is the part that’s kinda disgusting). I quickly learned that apparently walking full time really gets your stomach working. So I’m almost always constipated and it really sucks. Yesterday, I spent all day in pain because I was so constipated that even after I inserted a suppository in, I couldn’t go. And the worst part of it is that I have 2 little siblings in their tweens (I’m 24 myself) and it’s just so goddamn embarrassing - I try to be a role model to them and they just see this pathetic side of me.

One final thing that honestly makes it so much worse for me personally is that I’m really lonely - both socially and romantically. Along with my severe depression prior to my injury, I had severe social anxiety (much more exacerbated by the fact that I was also 2 years younger than all my peers in my grade). Don’t get me wrong - I still had friends and everything, but I’m 24 and I’ve never even kissed a girl. And I go to university too (I’m starting my masters in January), but I feel like people are kinda scared of me/apprehensive about getting to know me because I’m in a wheelchair and have a slurred voice.

Hell, I even typed the latter half of this while lying on the floor because while home alone with my little brother, I was dumb and fell while walking with my walker. So I’ve been just waiting for my mom to come home so that she can help me get up.

I could really just use some kind words right now because I just feel absolutely pathetic."
"I no longer have any idea what to do. Every other night is some hellish argument and I am so beyond tired of feeling like a sub human piece of shit when logically I shouldn’t. I know even know why I am still here anymore and I’m wrestling with the fact that there’s no alternative, no way out, and no getting better.

I don’t know what to do."
"Please help me, how do I get over her? How? She was my sunlight, she was my anchor, my princess, I love her so much and she said she wants to break up because her mental health is making her incapable of being in love for the next few years. This is unreal I am bawling my eyes out everything hurts! :("
"ive always had a skipping problem and everytime i would skip a few days, i would be afraid to go back to class because i didn't want to dissapoint my teachers or bother them with having to help me catch up what i've missed. I also really don't want my classmates to ask me ""why were you absent?"" or ""are you skipping?"". It just makes me feel worst since i don't want to be a bad student. Ive missed almost every music class for the past 6 weeks and im learning a new instrument so its just getting worst and worst. The anxiety is driving me absolutely insane to the point where i cant sleep properly and cant focus on anything at all, im just constantly thinking about how i would get dissapointed stares from my professors and people around me.

Any ideas on how i can overcome this :("

"I got fired and feel like my world is falling apart at the moment. I know it's not the case but I can't stop how I feel about it. I don't really have people I can talk to. I'm a closed off person and don't usually ask for help but it would be nice to get some support. I'm shy to share about myself and won't vent much, just would be nice to talk to someone kind to take my mind off of it."

"i take stimulant medication for my ADHD and the current dosage that i'm on makes me extremely nauseous. i talked to my psych already, and we're going to lower my dosage - but in the meantime i need to take the medication that i currently have so i can function at work. but i'm dealing with the nausea right now and man it feels like shit. and it makes me feel a little helpless, emotionally.

this is embarrassingly vulnerable - perhaps even Cringe - but it would comfort me a lot to hear some reassurance/sympathy akin to a parent/guardian/similar authority figure soothing a child."
"
i’m 22 and i’m hoping i’ll be able to move out with my boyfriend sometime next year, we’re long distance and we’re trying to save up 

my parents and i have a very odd relationship. my mom is an alcoholic and is very much emotionally/mentally abusive and was physically abusive when i was a kid. my dad and i have a better relationship, but i also consider him to be emotionally abusive and an enabler for my mom 

my sister and i were supposed to move out together, but she ultimately decided she wants to move in with her boyfriend

i’m from california and never considered leaving. mostly because i never thought leaving would ever be an option for me. my boyfriend lives in massachusetts, which i know is really far, but everyone says i should go for at least 6 months. my therapist and psychiatrist strongly believe ill be happier with the move, but how do you restart your life?

i’m leaving everything i know behind, which excites and scares me. soon im going to create an entire new life with new people in a new state, and i have no idea how to start that

how do you begin a new life? what do i need to bring, do and remember? 

my main concern is, what do i need to remember if i freak out and regret moving and miss my old life?"
"
18M-It’s been a month and some change since she broke up with me and I can’t keep pretending like I’m okay- she left bc she said she wasn’t ready, and now I’m depressed and heartbroken with everyone telling me to “Just move on”. I loved that girl and now she is just gone and I don’t know how to go on when I keep waking up and living every day with a heavy heart waiting on her to come back. I think sometimes about leaving, like as the only way to get out of my own head and because I just don’t see myself getting over this. I don’t know anymore"
Hi I really want someone to talk to and chat. I have no friends or family and I feel lonely. I just want to feel like I have a friend for a little bit. This past year has been hell on earth for me and all I want is to feel seen and cared about. I feel so empty. I’m 22f and would prefer another female voice but open to anyone. 
"Yeah. That's it. I've got things on my plate I struggle alot to talk about. If you're willing to give me a chunk of free time, I'd really appreciate it. "
I feel suicidal. Impulsively acted on it. Just want someone to talk to. If possible. Yea. Thanks. 
"I've been single since 2017. Ever since my last relationship ended, I've made an effort to avoid even seeing my ex in photos or anything like that.

For context, she left me for someone else after falling out of love with me. Our relationship lasted 3 years.

Despite doing my best to avoid anything to do with her, sometimes my curiosity gets the better of me. Thus morning was one of those times. I didn't see any pictures of her which is a plus, however, through a mutual of ours, I found out that she is still with the guy she left me for. They have a house and pets and all that good happy stuff.

I really want to be happy for her even though she hurt me years ago and I suppose part of me is happy for her, yet I can't help thinking ""why couldn't that have been me? What was wrong with me?""

I know the relationship has been over for years and I thought I was over it by now but maybe it isn't as resolved as I thought.

I'm just looking for some kind words or advice. I don't really have anyone I can talk to."
"I've always had issues with sleep, probably because I'm AuDHD. Last few weeks I just don't sleep until I get too exhausted to stay awake. Tonight it's been impossible. 

My (37m) mum is having a triple bypass in about 3 hours and I can't shut my brain up. I keep thinking about her passing away during the surgery. I feel guilty and sadbecause I didn't get to say goodbye to her today because I had passed out after not sleeping for 2 nights. My brain is too busy and I hate myself."
This is just for anyone who needs it. I’m sorry if things are hard right now. I hope they will get better. 
"Idk who'll even see this or if im just screaming into space but im just feeling very stressed and scared and despairing about my life. Im an addict and i have been since i was a teenager. I have been to rehab 3 times and even managed to get clean for six months a couple yrs ago but relapsed earlier this year and idk i feel worse than i have done ever both physically and mentally atm. Have struggled with huge depression all my life, started using as a way to self medicate after childhood abuse rly and just got trapped in this spiral, drugs, sex work, huge depression. Am stuck doing sex work cos i dont have a fixed address and i look awful cos of the drugs and not taking care of myself. Idk it just feels like a long long way towards getting my shit together now and i am starting to lose hope its ever gonna happen, i just dont have the energy, I just wanna cry. Would love it if I could message someone no judgment, its gonna be depressing as hell tho cos i dont rly have anything positive going on, lol."

"long week of fights with the wife, she fills called to move and I can't move as I just started a job I love. I think this probably means divorce. on top of that I'm going to have to move in with my parents till I can find a place of my own and I have to re-home my cat and tarantula to move in with my parents. honestly I just want to crawl in a dark hole and disappear. I hurt. I know it will get better and I'm working on finding a therapist cause this is going to be hard. it wasn't this hard the first time my wife and I separated for two years but I think the fact that she initiated the fixing of things and I got my hopes up that it would work out have made it hurt so much I just need someone to talk to."
"i dont know what to do ,my parents are tight on money and are stressed and im in pain and we can afford dental implants, i dont know what to do."
Preferably counselling from women who have problems with their mothers. But anyone who can listen will do
All my friends are asleep but I feel really lonely and can't sleep myself. And the person who I was talking to before was kind of more focused on her tv show than on me so I kind of felt unimportant. I would like to talk to somebody about anything please

"Hey everyone, I've been lurking here for a little while and decided to put myself out there, as I enjoy talking to people and maybe can help someone. I'm 48M, married to a spouse who is bipolar, and parent to an LGBTQ+ teen. I was raised Catholic, but am now an atheist, though I love to discuss/debate religion in general.

"Recently moved to a new city, went no contact with my family, and had to leave behind my cats and only friend. My friend suddenly stopped talking to me for reasons unknown but I’m trying to give them space. I just don’t know how to cope anymore, I feel so alone. I’ve tried crisis lines but I’ve been waiting for someone in the text line for three hours now. I feel hopeless when I should feel excited and relieved. I just want someone to talk to.  "

"Haven't been having a good day. I feel really hurt. Not sure what else I want to say, other than I wish I had someone who would try to cheer me up."
"They say desperation makes you less attractive, so maybe that's my problem. All I've ever known is rejection and unrequited feelings. I really want a relationship but I'm so so tired of getting feelings for people just to realize they won't be returned. At some points I've wished I didn't have these feelings but I don't think I wish that anymore. I just wish I could have some stability in love, knowing that the other person loves me back, rather than all this build up of hope and emotions only to get let down. At this point it feels like I'm playing the lottery. I learned a year and a half ago that I'm autistic so maybe I really am playing the lottery. It doesn't help that my brain interprets friendliness from women as romantic interest in me, or that I get attached really easily and tend to hyperfocus on someone I like. I can't even shut my brain off from doing this. It's worse the more I know someone, so I pretty much can't be friends with women else I risk developing feelings and then dealing with all these frustrations. I just saw a friend recently from before the time I knew all this about myself, and I think seeing her sent me into this whirlwind of emotions. I guess I should have known this was a risk. I just ... I can't give up on love, but I'm tired of all the uncertainty. I just want something stable, loving, and where I can trust in what we have. I guess this isn't much different from anyone else who is single. I guess I just need to vent."
I have depression and i'm alone. If someone could talk to me i'd be grateful.
"Everything feels pointless, and hopeless, and futile. I haven't been truly happy in years. I just find things to distract myself from the existential horror and dread. I'm so tired."
"I’ve been sitting for this family since I was around 13, while they go on their yearly summer vacation. Their dogs both died within the last year, so I stayed at the same house, but it was their kid’s dogs. 2 large doodles and 1 small beagle mix. It was my first time with them.

The doodles are really rough and excitable. The beagle mix is anxious, and for some reason always humps the one dog which would end with the big dog pushing him away. They got along, but it was always really chaotic. I have chronic pain, so I actually decided a few days ago that I can’t sit for these dogs next year. 

I’ve been a vet tech for a while, with experience in emergency medicine. There’s this look that dogs get when they hurt their neck or back. In the morning, the beagle wouldn’t eat. He’s super anxious and eats slowly, but he had the “back pain” look (I don’t even know how to explain it, just from experience). I texted their owner and said I think his back hurts, and they said he also doesn’t eat when it’s going to storm. There have been storms almost every day, so it could have been either thing. 

I brought him upstairs with me for the final night of my stay, and he was crying (he cries all the time basically so that wasn’t unusual). When I woke up in the morning, the big dogs were still in bed. He was crying downstairs, so I came down to check on him. He was by the front door and near the base of the stairs. 

I realized that his back legs were paralyzed. I’ve seen this plenty before, so I made sure he’s got circulation to his feet (so probably not a blood clot). I’m thinking it’s a disc issue, which it commonly is. The larger dogs are slamming into me and running around, so I had him between my legs on the ground trying to protect him. 

I’m disabled, so I’m not very strong. They also only have fabric baby gates which the big dogs can get through easily. They also open the doors or jump hard on them if you shut them. So basically I cannot separate the dogs without them destroying something. So i call my husband to rush over, and he helped me. 

I sat with him on the bed for a while, and then realized he hasn’t peed since last night. I’m pretty sure he can’t pee because of his injury. So I carried him outside and tried to see if he could go with the help of a sling on his lower belly. I tried to feel his bladder, and he bit the shit out of my foot. My own fault, I knew better than to do that alone on a painful dog. 

I called his owners and explain as soon as I saw him. They came home early from their vacation, and I told them which Vet ER to go to (the one I worked at was awful, and I knew the spinal surgeon at the one I sent them to is fantastic). 

They ended up going to a closer ER which I know is not very good. He ended up needing surgery for a herniated disc, with a 50/50 shot at being permanently paralyzed. 

I got a text today that for whatever reason (I didn’t get details), he is dying and has less than a day left. I’m not sure if it was an anesthetic complication or what. 

He’s only 5 years old, and I feel so heartbroken and guilty. I feel like there must have been some way I could have prevented this. I shouldn’t have brought him upstairs, I shouldn’t have moved him as much, I should have insisted harder on going to the better hospital. I could have even brought him to the hospital myself to get quicker care. I don’t know. I feel like throwing up.

I just need some kind words because I feel like I’m going to burst into tears at any moment.

"Good evening y'all. I'm having an otherwise slow and uneventful time tonight and I reckon I'm best put to use giving someone an ear and shoulder.

"Hey, 

First time here. I don't want to bother my friends with this, although it's getting really heavy to carry lately.

Just like the title says, I've \[M32\] been struggling with this breakup for the past 8 months. Recently, seeing her with a new bf and knowing she's coming back to my country for a week, revived the wound just when I was finally getting better. There's religion involved in the breakup and I will probably not be tender towards religions if we get to talk, I prefer warning now.

Ideally, I'd love to talk with someone who's also in need of an ear. My friends always said I'm a good listener :) And by voice if possible, I'm kinda craving deep talk with someone and not that small talk I get everyday around me.

Hope this reaches someone.

"Hello everyone. When I was little, I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. Throughout my life, I was unaware that I had this condition, until my dad told me recently, I inherited it from him.

Throughout the 18 years I have been alive, I have felt like an alien, something not human. People never wanted me, I never felt accepted, I was always too shy and introverted to make conversation. Even now, I still feel like no one gets me, I've struggled with loneliness for over a year now, because I started living a solitary life, and I feel like friendships and relationships aren't possible for someone like me.

Even if people with Asperger's can be unable to understand the feelings of others, I can. I've been so empathetic and kind to people, but deep down, I feel alone, unloved, I would do anything for a long, warm and gentle hug.

I hope that the people with hearts reading this can understand. Thank you for reading.❤️"
"I, a 22 year old woman am struggling to get my driving licence.

Some background: I had a difficult time getting driving practice during high school as my parents did not really know how to teach me. and I struggled to find a driver's ed school that fit into my schedule at the time so I just chose to wait until I graduated to start driving. However, the pandemic cut off my senior year and it was nearly impossible to find driving lessons during quarantine. After the pandemic was over I took adult lessons and realized I have quite a lot of anxiety when driving. Although I did learn how to drive on the roads, parallel park, make 3-point turns, etc, I still did not get over my anxiety. I knew Massachusetts driving exams are quite difficult so I practiced a lot regardless.

Cue to this year when I took my first driving test after almost a full year of practice and perfecting my driving, I thought the test wouldn't be too bad. I was trying to stay positive but as soon as I stepped into the vehicle for the test, sheer panic entered my body as I just realized I was in my license test. I greeted the instructor, did hand signals, and was finally about to put the car in drive. As soon as the vehicle started moving my heart dropped as it went faster than I anticipated. the parking lot was not all that downhill but the car was moving quite a bit for my foot to barely touch the gas. My anxiety completely took over and I practically forgot how to drive. Those months of practice and practice suddenly disappeared and it was like I was behind the wheel the first time. I of course failed as I was driving too slow and forgot to check blind spots when doing certain things. I came home and cried in my bed the whole day. My family was luckily supportive and told me there was no need to cry as it is so common for people to fail, it doesn't define anything about me or my skills.  After a few months, I finally scheduled another exam and started practicing more. I even booked another lesson with the school before my exam so I could get more used to the cars. The day of the test (4 weeks ago btw) I stepped into the vehicle and that panic I told you about earlier came straight back. Once again the vehicle felt like it was going fast again and I got super anxious. When I tried to do parallel parking I was panicking so bad that I wasn't able to do it, even though I did the day before with no problem. I failed the exam even quicker this time and felt so much worse. I have another one 3 weeks I feel like if I fail this one I should just quit driving. it's like no matter how much practice I do none of it will matter if I just learn how to calm my nerves before the test. I've tried breathing exercises and eating something to help me calm down but nothing was working. I just hate seeing my friends and coworkers my age driving around in their cars while I still need my parents to drop me off/pick me up places like I'm in middle school. I live in a Massachusetts suburb and it's so embarrassing and isolating not being able to drive around freely. I just want my licence but my stupid anxiety just won't let me. I need advice and a lot of luck for my next exam.

UPDATE: i took my license exam and I PASSED. I HAVE MY DRIVERS LICENSE FINALLY. i was definitely still nervous taking this exam but i definitely did the thing i kept forgetting to do and that was shoulder checks. i was probably overdoing it but it’s way better than under doing it. i think my examiner was a bit less intimidating than the ones before and i think that helped my nerves better. i was turning a bit fast due to my anxiety but i think i got more comfortable near the end and drove more normal. when my examiner pointed it out i immediately thought i failed and was just about to accept it. but my examiner actually understood it was nerves rather than my real driving and passed me. i’m so grateful to have an examiner that’s looks beyond points and understood students driving patterns. i got out the car and looked for my mom in the parking lot. she was on the other side so i ran into her arms with tears saying i passed. (ik straight out of a movie scene) she was so happy and i was relieved to finally have that weight off my chest. im so glad i came home that day bringing such good news as i felt like i haven’t done anything like that in so long. although some may think it’s just a drivers test, it’s not that big of a deal, but getting my license was a big step i wanted to take as i want to get a good job to support my family. my life goal is to have a job with a great salary so my parents, especially my mom, can retire early. i owe so much to them and i want to do everything i can to give them the best life possible. i checked drivers license off my life checklist, next is a real adult job. wish me best of luck!  

P.S thank you to everyone who sent such heartwarming and supportive messages. i really appreciate it and as you can see from the amount i write, writing my feelings out helps a lot. thank you again for reading my lengthy essay of a post! "
"Hello everyone, I hope you are all doing well. I have been in a dark place recently. I am craving my mother's affection, as I have been very sad and lonely from not having much of a social life, as well as going through other stuff.

I feel conflicted over this, because my mother is an alcoholic, and what really hurts me, is that she used to be a very loving and caring mother before all of this, and she is constantly emotionally and sometimes physically abused by her partner.

I feel hopeless and lonely. I still feel like I'm too old to worry about this, I am a young adult after all. All I could ever want is a loving embrace from her.

I'm posting here, because I need someone to know. I can only expect kind words on here, and hopefully they come.

Thank you for reading, take care."
"So, I (20m) had this friend (19f) who I had a situationship with. She had an ex-girlfriend (19f) who I hooked up with on several occasions and I told my friend multiple times that I wouldn’t. And she found out

I broke her trust and I feel bad. But it’s more than just bad.

My friend made it out like I was some predator preying on her friend group (since her ex is also her friend) and I just feel so dirty and gross.

I feel so gross and so stuck and I don’t know what to do at all. I emailed my therapist and texted a crisis text line but neither have responded yet and I really really really need some support. I’ve never felt so stuck and lost before. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m on fire. "

"I have tried to stop hating myself. I even tried watching self help videos/tiktoks. But whenever they mentions something about ""moving on from insecure people"" or some sentiment like that - I can stop turning it on myself; that I'm the bad one for people, that I shouldn't be here, that I'm just a burden or only hurt people. I dunno how to explain it. I don't know what to do anymore"
"I am scared......
About everything,
I did not perform so well in my college entrance exam, this is my first ever big failure.
These past 3 years have made me so weak, zero social life and feeling scared of failure, for the past 3 years I was consumed by fear, these years have made me so weak mentally, I make promises to myself that I will change, and get better mentally, become stronger mentally, and fight my fears and be happier, but I also fear if i will ever be able to fulfill these promises

I would never let myself have so less of a social life ever again, worst thing that you can do to yourself is isolate yourself, it will fuck up everything in your head

the last 3 years have been so rough, I used to be so much more confident, I have become so miserable now

"Hello. 37/M.

I've been here many times before, but usually offering a kind voice. This time I'm on the opposite side of the fence. I was born with Spina Bifida, which has left me using a wheelchair my entire life. It has never defined my identity. I am more than my disability. But for nearly a decade now, my health has been getting worse, my body has been falling apart, and I'm hating getting older more and more each day. For the last several weeks, I've started to feel myself slipping back into depression because it is so hard to juggle taking care of my physical health AND my mental health simultaneously, while trying to survive and just be a functioning human. I'm in a relationship, but I'm lonely. I can't find a primary care physician or a psychologist, and my new psychiatrist office has been failing at getting me my medications. I'm bored and lonely and scatterbrained all the time. Can so eone keep me company in my inbox, please? I have previous posts that talk more about my personality and who I am. Thanks for reading, and have a fucking fantastic day!"
"Hey everyone, sometimes we all need a place to let things out. Whether you want to share a frustration, express a feeling, or simply talk about what’s on your mind, this is the place for you. No judgment here—just a listening ear and a supportive community. Feel free to unload and lighten your load. "
"Hello. 22F, I don’t know if I need someone to listen or to talk to. Or maybe it would make me happier to just put this out there. 

I’m struggling so hard with my mental health. I’ve been diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder and while I think I have a form of it, I think I have way more than just that. A lot of it caused by childhood trauma. The behaviors I have regarding my anxiety are so learned and engrained into my brain that I can’t snap myself out of the fight or flight responses (which are 100% of the time flight)

I’m always exhausted, I feel behind at all times. I have raging panic and anxiety attacks. The kind that make you hyperventilate and stutter on your words, the inability to communicate during these episodes is so embarrassing especially considering in my field of work(military), the people around me are obligated and required to make sure I’m ok before I go so if I cry in the wrong place, I’ll be forced to talk to more superiors (who are taken out of the work space because of me) who basically just stare at me while I spew out nonsense on why I’m upset. Its embarrassing. It reminds me of how abnormal I am.

I’ve tried everything. Breathing only works temporarily, 3-3-3 rule is also temporary. Therapy which I’m so incredibly lucky to have works to an extent but inevitably as whatever I have adapts and develops, I always discover new issues and things I’m unable to fix about myself which leads me right back to step 1. Medication has helped significantly with the frequency of the attacks but also doesn’t help enough to where it’s manageable. 

I’m tired :( I’m tired of crying for hours at a time and not going out with friends because I’m too scared or anxious. Or avoiding being social in fear of 10000 different things. I’m tired of screaming in my car and ruining my voice because it gives me a millisecond of relief. I’m tired of thinking about all the memories of being mentally abused and taken advantage of in life. I’m just so tired.

And I know this sounds concerning. But don’t be too concerned. I love myself and I want to be better. Desperately, so desperately that it’s one of my main stressors.

Anyways if there’s anyone out there that can maybe rationalize or help me rationalize everything? Or maybe give me advice on what I can do to manage this better? Maybe play some games and talk? Idk I’m desperate for some kind words and advice right now.

I didn't know about this community so I thought why not give it a try. Thanks for reading. 



I don't have support right now. My parents were abusive, and they're not in my life anymore. Growing up there wasn't really anyone supportive in my life, I didn't really understand what that felt like in general. I've felt love and support before in the form long term relationship, it really helped me feel like things could be ok. Not a recent or bad breakup, we're still on good terms but both agreed it's for the best to not see each other or talk much at all. 



I still think about all the kind words she had for me when I needed them most, I had never been treated like that before. I didn't realize it at the time, but she was giving me the love I didn't get as a kid. Some days I really try to remember how that felt, and it's like I can still kind of feel that love inside again 



I know its not the case, but sometimes I cant help but feel entirely unlovable."
"I've always loved cats and had never had a problem being around them. I was so happy when I adopted my Gnocchi in 2019 and devastated when she died in summer of 2023 of fiv. 2 months ago we decided to adopt two new strays, Pitchi and Pera. The moment we brought them home I immediately felt my throat close. Initially, I thought maybe it was psychosomatic or reflux. Went from doctor to doctor to find out what the hell's wrong since I have an array of weird, intense symptoms. I feel like I've tried everything at this point. Filters, I clean every day, daily showers, special cat food... I currently take a shitton of meds and still feel like I'm down with the flu all the time. I absolutely hate it but there's really no other option than to give the cats away. We already found a kind older lady who's willing to take them. Her cat recently died and I think they'll have a great home there. This gives me solace. But I still feel like my shitty body and immune system are taking one of the few dreams I've ever had from me - owning cats. I know it sounds silly and like I' wallowing in pity but I am just grieving... I'll really miss Pitchi and Pera. I'm just sad and looking for some kind words..."

"I've been coming back and forth with this girl for about...2 years,maybe?We broke up 3 times, I was the one who chose to in 2 of them.

Maybe I was wrong,but I diddnt feel quite comfortable with some things she said or did, like, she would have friends and not talk to them about me, to the point they didnt know she had a bf, and I'm not talking about some superficial friendship, she could spend 10 hours a week for 6 to 7 months with them, specially with one of them, and never tell him that I existed, that made me feel really uncomfortable and insecure.

She also ALWAYS had a ""best friend"", and what I mean for this is that she would meet some dude (always dudes), they would become really close really fast and sometimes she would choose not to introduce me to the guy because, and I quote, ""she didnt want him to go away if he found out she had a bf"", to which I responded that ""A friend that leaves if you say u have a bf, is not a friend,is some guy trying to have his chance with u"" but she wouldnt listen, it became to a point that I would feel anxious just because I had to answer or meet with her and I decided to break up for the second time, and probably final; but I find myself thinking about her, missing her smell, or to just put my head in her chest and dissociate from the world...should I talk to her?Stay gone?

"I have made posts on this subreddit before looking for someone to listen to me talk about my hard times, but I want to put out an update with something positive. Hopefully, this post is within community guidelines! (I couldn't find anything that suggested a positive update is against the rules). 

Anyway, I've talked about my struggles with mental health and school in this community before, and many people have talked to/supported me through it. 

I want to say: Thank you! ❤️ And I GRADUATED!!! 

I finished high school and am looking for a job in a bank, because finance is something I am interested in! I am feeling much, MUCH better since being rid of the bane of my existence (school). I have not decided if I will walk the stage for graduation or not, but I still have time to make a decision. I have also figured out my sexuality! It feel better to know that other people are the same way when it come to crushes and relationships.

I've spent the past week crying due to a mix of emotions. I am happy that I have graduated and can now move on, but if I'm being honest, I didn't think I would live long enough to graduate high school. I thought that I would not be able to bare the weight of my deciding mental health until I graduated, but I did! And it's such a relief, but it's also nerve racking. I get really nervous about the future, but if I could get through public high school, then I can get through whatever comes next. 

Thank you all for your support! It has helped me go further than I thought I would ❤️❤️❤️

Also, side note, I have talked about moving to a different country before, and I still do think about it. I won't unless Project 2025 is put in effect. If that is put into federal law, I will be fleeing the U.S., but let's hope it does not come to that! "

"I feel like all my life I have been trying to escape from my life and I'm finally trying to stop that lately but I'm having an issue I never expected. Throughout my childhood, from before I could even read, I was escaping from my life to video games. At points in my teen years I had difficulties separating life in reality from my life in fantasy. In games, it's so easy to feel like consequences have very little weight because you can reload your save, or at worst, start a whole new save. What I never expected was the degree of identity issues I would have coming back to reality tho. I look at myself in the mirror and see a stranger. I was born male but identify as questioning at this point, as a child many people thought I was a girl, and I would reject that because I felt I needed to because my father would so angrily reject it too, but in games I almost always played as a girl. I feel like games gave the chance to live so many different lives, but now that I'm trying to live this real life, I'm feeling like I started a game half way thru with a character with terrible stats that I never would have picked even just on appearances and there is no starting a new save. I've neglected my real life for what feels like the entirety of it up to this point, and trying to step into reality is overwhelming. I carry a lot of self-loathing for the last 28yrs of my life. I'm trying to get things in order in my life but it teels like a losing battle. Nothing seems to help me feel ok with being in this body and this life. I've started therapy recently but it hasn't felt like it's been accomplishing anything at all, and I'm planning to try different therapists and forms of therapy but in the interim I'm hoping to find someone to talk to about ny identity issues especially. I would prefer someone who has first hand experience with gender questioning, and would strongly prefer not to talk to anyone with religious affiliations(I have a bad past with that and is something Im in therapy for)"

"I feel like I really just need some emotional support, I'm just going through a ton of negative emotions alone right now.

Sort of ironically, me figuring out why I feel this need so strongly is what set me off. My therapist recommended me a book talking about growing up with emotionally immature parents and how to manage and move on from it, and it's been a heavy read for me. I haven't even gotten that far yet, but it really set me off today. While it's good to know the source of many of my problems, it's a tough pill to swallow seeing how what they did to me affects me so badly. It felt like the book was talking specifically to me, and it's a pretty sad lens to have to look at my past through.

I took a step back and realized that this was why I had craved meaningful connections with people, and why I currently feel so awful for not having them. It answered lots of the ""where do these feelings come from"" questions, but it's so painful to realize this is why I miss the few people in my life who I felt were kind to me so so much. 

Besides some people like my therapist, I've basically been doing my therapy journey all on my own. I've done so much improvement, so much trauma processing, so much acceptance, so much hardship all on my own, with mostly apathy or extremely brief praise from those around me. It's an awful journey to be doing alone, I really can't express enough how hollow I feel sometimes. It's just like trust falling into the void over and over again. For as much better as I'm doing, I feel stuck. It's unbelievably scary asking for help or trusting others from my background. It really feels like I need support to go find support, support you just don't have.

I'd really appreciate some kind words about this, thank you for reading :)"
"I know, I know. I did a bad thing. I’m not proud of it. I just really did like her and it turned out we had liked eachother long before she even had this girlfriend. I just wish I had said something earlier. I didn’t intend to become the other man. It was very “one thing led to another”. 

But in short, she chose to stay with her girlfriend and while I’m getting better, I’m still devastated. She and I are still friends. She’s a great person even if she did a not so great thing. But I still really like her and I really don’t know what to do and I’d like to talk to someone about it.

"Hi everyone just looking to chat to someone as I just feel so lonely sometimes and I do feel often a sense of being tired of the way life has been for the past few years.

I think this is a common feeling to some degree but it seems like ever since 2020 nothing has quite felt right, I don't feel like I've mentally aged in the years since then it feels odd to actually say the age I am now.

This type of feeling has fluctated over the years but I'm often back to comparing my life now to 2020 and prior and just thinking about how much happier I was back in those days, it just feels like I used to have a bit more freedom with my life and that I was able to do so much more you know?

I also have this tendency in my head to wish i did some things much earlier than I eventually did, it can be something as mundane as not playing a video game more when I was younger to the point of completion. I think another factor is just how 2020 ruined a lot of my plans for some content creation that had to be delayed by a year and for a couple years it wasn't really safe to meet up with some friends for events like it used to be and some events were straight up cancelled for a long time.

I also went through a lot of friendships that had lasted years, started just before the pandemic or during it just ending in 2021 or shortly after for various reasons, and I understand thats just the way life is sometimes but sometimes I can't help but feel like ""if the pandemic didnt keep us indoors more often we wouldn't have been so hot headed and burned bridges"". There's also a few people in my life who passed away this decade and I can't fully accept that they're gone at times.

I try not to compare myself to other people like I used to but sometimes I still do which I know is bad and robs you of your joy. But yeah I hope to chat with some people about this and hopefully feel a little less awful."

"he revealed to me 2 days ago that he has a lump on his side. he told me it was a tumour. and the doctors said they'll want him back for another check up soon. 

i dont know what that lump actually is. 

a part of me says its cancer. 

a part of me says its just a random tumour that will go away after surgeries.

i dont know. 

hes only 55. 

hes been in his room today, mostly in bed. sometimes on his phone. 

he didnt go to work yesterday or today. 

whenever he comes in my room, he is unusually happy. and says positive things. 

i think hes trying to make this broken home of three, a happy one.... finally. all of a sudden. after all these years of ignoring the problems and the brokenness. and being so still. letting it all happen and becoming worse. 

hes trying to add a hint of happiness in this family of three, so suddenly.

and i dont know how to react. or think. or say. 

i know its a lie. 

i feel like hes crying, is scared, worried behind his happy mask. 

and i dont know what to do. 

i was abused as kid, by my mom- seen so much violence just from her. and in this family.

grew up in a broken, dysfunctional family- so i cant simply just go to his room and comfort him like a normal daughter. and it messes up my head. and it lead me to being even more depressed all day. thinking what went wrong in my life, why did myself and my life lead to this. and so on.

its too complicated. theres so much strain and distance. im just holed up in my room while all of this is happening. 

i still bear hatred for him. for what he has put me through as a child, to my teens, and so on. 

but seeing him like this, i feel fucking depressed. 

.....deep down, 

honestly, 

i think he will die.

.

. 

i think i will lose my only dad. 

.

.

and i will be alone. 

.

.

.

.

..

i think he will die this year. 2024. im sorry. i just dont have a positive mindset. im just a person whos broken. and has s\*\*\*\*dal thoughts. for years. i only see the bad outcomes in things. and its draining my spirit. while my dad is laying in bed, im torturing myself. while a normal daughter at my age, would just make him get hhis ass off the bed and take him to the clinic for that check up. but im sorry...... im not that type of daughter. after everything that happened to me the moment i was born, grew up into- this is who i am now. 

just when 2023 was awful.... i think 2024 will be.... probably the worst year. 

but i dont know yet. maybe god or whatever, will not take my dad away from me this year. 

this is all so sudden. this is happening so suddenly. 

what if he dies? 

what will my life be like? without my dad? 

will i cry when i see a dad and his little daughter on the street too? will i be fatherless?

i dont have a mom too. shes gone out of my life. 

will i lose my dad?

will he die? if he does....

.

.

i will be alone. 

.

and i dont think ill survive. 

.

.

today. i thoguht about k\*\*\*\* myself. after thinking about so many things. like always. always when im alone with my thoughts. 

deep down, im crying. im scared. 

i dont want to lose my dad. 

i want him to stay here. and watch me marry my lover, in the future. but theres something blocking that from happening. its his unknown health scare of a tumour or lump.

.

...

.

...what should i do? this is so tough. 

whatever. 

i will ask him tomorrow.... hows his situation with the clinic. and his problem. if i have to courage to. 

seeing my dad lay in his bed while i go to the kitchen, and seeing his dark room..... it just puts a small pin through my heart a bit. i dont like it. it feels like hes slowly dying. or as if hes already a ghost. 

i dont what hes doing. he didnt go to clinic today. and yesterday night, he was out. idk where. 

i dont know. 

...... im fucking depressed.

.

.

i hate my personality. 

but,

anyway, all of this, all of these problems, worries, and so on..... i know, time will tell. 

but the results will be unpredictable. 

or it can maybe even break a heart in the process. 

.

. 

deep down. im praying, asking god, to not take him away from me. 

...everything is fucking up my head, my heart and my declining mental health

My father is a really angry person. I don't get any breaks. When I am not working I am resolving conflicts between my mum and dad. I don't wanna be involved. But they drag me in. I am tired and frustrated and I see no out.
It's draining. I am not even sure what I am doing on this sub reddit.

I am scared of him (and sometimes of her too). They both try to control me and my finances. They don't let me out on trips without feeling guilty. And they bodyshame me a lot.

I see no end in sight. I feel no love, I don't feel loved. It's painful to be here.

I try to talk to them, get them to do family activities, go out together. But they just eat and come back. They refused to talk properly or spend time with me or each other. Am I supposed to keep being the peacemaker? I don't wanna do this but I feel responsible.

I wanna stop living if I have to live like this."
"I’ve experienced just about every terrible thing a person can witness… but I’ve made it through the other side. If you need to talk, I’m here. Love and light to you."
"Lately, it is as if my life is crumbling down around me. Living at home with my parents for the past four years has left me feeling alone and trapped. I have become a spectator in my own life, just going through the motions without any real sense of purpose or direction. Lately, I've been struggling to find the energy to do anything for myself. I am stuck in the same monotonous routine, barely feeling anything at all, except for the most terrible thoughts.

In March of 2020 I was forced to leave university and return home. For the past three years and 11 months I have been stuck at home. Literally stuck within these walls unable to go outside. Other than to take the trash out and bring it back in each week, I have not gone outside in nearly four years. The constant pressure to meet my family's expectations only adds to the stress. It is all just so overwhelming and exhausting all the time. No matter how hard I try, nothing is ever enough for them. There is a never-ending list of demands, chores, and responsibilities that are just for me. I have to take care of my parents, my brother, myself, the house, the bills, the phone calls, the trash, the food, etc. It is so suffocating. I can't help but feel taken for granted because of my gender. I never imagined my life would become this, a servant in my own home, and it is hard not to feel resentful about it.

All of my friends have moved on with their lives and forgotten about me. It hurts, but I can't blame them. I don't want to hold them back for my sake. Even in my online classes, it has become difficult keep up. I used to be the top of my class, but am now just doing the bare minimum to stay enrolled. I don't care about these classes, the people in them, or where I stand in relation to my classmates. I am so close to completing this degree, but I don't care. It has become so meaningless. I find myself daydreaming about leaving everything behind and starting over somewhere new. Somewhere free from the weight of my family's expectations. To live a life on my own terms. But the thought of actually making that leap is too much. I am saving money where possible, but jumping out into the world without any sort of support system is an absolutely terrifying thought.

The only distraction from my life is sexual gratification. I am a sex addict in the most extreme way. This is a difficult thing to type out and an even more difficult thing to change. I have been struggling with these urges for more than a year and I can no longer live with these intrusive thoughts. I can't stop myself from acting. It doesn't feel as if I can escape my circumstances, which makes me seek refuge in these urges even more. They are absolutely horrific and have gotten me into so much trouble. They pop in to my head and I am terrified to act on them but cannot resist. There is no one to talk to anyone about any of this, as I am too afraid what would happen if someone found out. These urges help nothing. They waste time, rot my mind, and further erode my sense of self. It was the only thing in the world that I had that was mine, and even that doesn't feel safe anymore. As much as I try to stop and distance myself from those thoughts, ultimately I only flail around desperately each time until I ultimately fail.

Every day feels like a struggle anymore, like I am stuck in this endless loop of monotony and despair. I just want to find happiness and purpose in life again, but I don't know where to start. I am not a danger to myself or anything like that. This is an appeal for advice. How do I get out from under my family? How do I start over? How do I go no contact with all of them? How do I find happiness in this terrible world?"
"Hello.  I’m Em.  In the coming days, I expect to be rejected from my dream university, which I’ve unhealthily placed way too much emphasis on as a “new beginning” and second chance at securing a life I long stopped hoping for.  When I applied, I felt I was in a place in life where I could accept that and be grateful that I got to spend more time with family.  Since then, my grandma’s dementia has declined immensely, I’ve had to be put on heart medicines (unrelated, but still a big life change) and been to the ER 3 times this year and everything seems ever so bleak.  Everything I liked to do is no longer fun or available to me.  I used to make music but I feel absolutely no urge to create.  I’ve moved to the countryside away from everything I’ve known in order to remove my 92 year old grandma from an abusive home situation.  I have slowly drifted away from everyone.  I have friends, but no one I feel close to anymore.  I’m a good listener and I want to make a real, long term close friend.  I feel things intensely.  Injustice bothers me to my core.  I am way too open and I will want the best for you.  If you’re struggling, or know what it’s like to feel entirely hopeless and alone, let’s hold on together….  No minors, please.  No NSFW content either. I’m 25, btw. "
I could honestly just use someone to talk to right now &lt;3
"I'm feeling so low right now, the last year has been pretty awful. Wife and I had been trying for a baby for 18~24 months. In July I had to go away for a work trip, and when I got back she told me she was pregnant. Feeling on top of the world, went in for 8 week scan and everything looked good, went back at 12 weeks, no heartbeat, nothing can be done. 

Spent the next 3 months feeling the lowest I've ever been, almost ended it a few times. I feel like I have come out from those suicidal feelings now, but they have been replaced with complete apathy. The thought that I have to keep existing for the next x years makes me so bored, I feel I have nothing to look forward too 

I used to have lots of hobbies, but nothing interests me now, so to fill the extra time I just work more, 12-14 hours a day or I feel worse because being at home gives me more time to think about how long I have left to go.

Also having some contention with wife, she is overweight and 3 separate doctors, including a fertility doctor, have said her weight is essentially halving the chance of another pregnancy. A brief period  after the miscarriage she was motivated to try and lose weight. I got her out of bed early everyday and we were working on a couch2 5k together. I also took over the cooking and she lost 8kg, and I started feeling hopeful but old habits die hard, and she gave up again. 

She has now quit her job, halving our income, so it's kind of lucky I work such long hours, or there wouldn't be money for bills. She said she wants to use this time off work to reduce stress and work on her weight, so I support it, but also it adds stress to me to find more work and ensure we have enough money. 

I tried counseling for a bit, but I couldn't stand the fakeness of the counselor, and the way they talk so it didn't really help. We also tried marriage counseling, which I can't lie, it did improve the relationship. Has anyone else gone through this total apathy and boredom with life, but is also not at that stage where you are brave enough to just end it all? How did you get out of it? What am I doing wrong?"
"Well I'm back after a fairly long break.

So let's go.

I'm offering ANYONE that needs it, a place to be able to scream into the abyss without judgment oe just needs to get something off their chest, or is steuggling, advice can be given if asked for but only on topics I feel it is appropriate to advise on.

Don't be shy throw a message."
"I am just in need of someone to listen and offer some support by doing so. I am failing at life. Everything is going to shit or has been for some time. I split up with my sons father after 10 years together which was 10 years ago and its like everything I hated in him i have become. I cant seem to find the motivation to do things I need to like getting a job. I've never not worked and then when we split up I was fired for the first time in my life and then held a job i liked a lot for 5 months and got fired again, ever since I'm afraid to fail again and just haven't been able to make myself look for another. That was almost a year ago and its way past due for me to get my shit together. I am living with my dad and helping him get his house renovated so I justified that it was okay since I was busy helping him. However he just told me that he wants me out because I'm not working. I cant do both and now I am failing even more. I am so beyond disgusted with myself and have been a terrible example to my son. I am also unable to get him to listen to me which I attribute to his ADHD and being six. I don't know I know what I need to do but cant seem to do it. I'm scared shitless about my sons future and his stability. IDK... "
"Open to talking with you about whatever is on your mind. Reaching out can be hard, so feel free to just say hi in the comments if you want me to reach out. Alternatively, you can DM me as well.

"I'm in my early 30's, never dated before, and I'm worried that I'm the problem. Being single has never bothered me in my 20's, but now that I'm in my 30's, it hits differently. It feels like no matter what I do and no matter what I try, it's never good enough. I'm trying to meet new people, I recently joined a community band in my area, for many reasons, but the main goal is to find someone who cares about me. I'm autistic, so it's hard for me to make and maintain friendships with people, and what makes it so difficult for me is that I don't understand the social cues from others, like when to speak up and say I'm there for someone. Also, I don't understand when to advance things to the next level, so I'm super confused on when someone genuinely likes me, and when to get more intimate. I drink heavily, and, since it's legal in my state, I do pot. I know it's not a very good solution, but it's effective, temporarily. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but considering the time of year, I could really use some words of encouragement."
"I feel like I’m out of my mind and I don’t know what to do. So I guess this may just be a rant idk…  Two weeks ago we found that out 2019 house has a ton of wiring issues stemming from the builder, but every lawyer we called said you’re SOL and have to pay for it. Additionally we’ve had to pay for two sinks falling. My boyfriend and I’ve have been having a lot of friction. He also suffers from cyclical panic attacks and those three days he gets them, I get them too trying to help him out and function. I’m drowning in debt. My boss has been begging for a promotion for us because we literally get paid in the bottom 1% of people and they said it will be difficult because we’re a non profit and money is tight. Well they are about to promote a person who basically has similar qualifications, and are paying her 50% more than she’d make in the corporate world due to nepotism. Lastly, my mom has been really sick, and after extensive testing we thought we finally found answers, in the country we’re from. She didn’t agree with it but was going to follow their instructions on medicine. Today, doctors here in the US (same doctors that dismissed her) told her to stop taking her medication. She agreed to stop because this is the same conclusion her favorite antivaxxer doctor told her. I’m just so overwhelmed and I can tell I’m overwhelming everyone talking about these things. I’m slipping into a depression I fear. I feel like there is just so much happening at once and it just wished I could run away somewhere."
"With shitty mental health starting 2019 till today. I have been under care of mental health professionals since 2021 when I hit my lowest. But havent been able to find any peace of mind. Happy moments are less common than sad ones but they do occur. Even in those moments i truly want su\*cide(assisted and painless i hop) as way out of my misery. Past 5 years have exhausted me emotionally and i feel very very worn out. Life is a distorted sin curve and I AM TIRED of the ups and downs. I think I am driven by logic hence I am looking for reasons not to end it all. I want arguments in favor of living. Keep in mind the following-                                                                                                                                                                  1.I dont believe in any religion. I know a ton about all 6-7 major religions, None convince me so skip religious arguments.                                                                                                                                                      2. Living for family/friends/others sounds like a kind of slavery to me (please dont take this in historical sense of the word, I mean it in the literal sense of the word). I dont want to live coz not living would hurt other, bcoz living is hurting me and nobody is coming to share my burden. I do not wish to reciprocate even if somebody does come to share my burden.                                                                                3. I used to be ambitious but my ambitions is partly responsible for the state I am in today. While I actually want to bring change in the world etc. I feel this might just be a nice daydream to me but its not coming true. I simply lack the capacity to work hard for it. I used to be able to work hard like 5 years back, but now I am never sure of anything and that prevents me from working hard.

4. No happiness that I can imagine seems worth facing the pain that i have felt so far. (tho I am pretty blessed with the material comfort and I am sure there are so many situations in the world that are so much worse than mine)

summary- all the happiness that i know of and can imagine does not seem worth all the misery I know of and can imagine)

5.What really led me to this point- Starting 2019 i deteriorated academically, I felt incredibly lonely in all my personal struggles. Everything came together- covid lockdown, academic deterioration, discovering sexuality, being dumped, increasing emotional distance with immediate as well as distant family. Result extreme emotional exhaustion that does not go away.

I have lost my sense of self, I have constant self-doubt in everything i do. I do not know my weaknesses and strengths, I do not trust anybody else to assess that for me. I used to think that why not live coz once you die its end of consciousness but now I think my consciousness is the source of my misery.

"i coud've killed someone

Back in November I worked retail in a small store, early in the morning. I always got really anxious before and the job wasn't for me. I had a maximum of 3 hours of sleep because of my anxiety of working there. I have worked there for 4 months, 2/3 days a week at that point.

  
Around 7am on a Friday/Saturday, my head was pounding and I couldn't think properly. I saw this man, in his 50s or 60s, staring at the hot food counter. He stared at it for ages. I was suspicious of this and thought this was what I do when I'm drunk. Then when he turned around he turned a bit wide, but he didn't stumble. There was a nagging feeling within myself that he was drunk.

  
He bought alcohol and food, not anything strong from what I remember, but I just approved it. I am not blaming anyone for this and take responsibility. I was used to approving everything - I've never seen a rejection of sales before because of age, we always approve it. I know I shouldn't have done it but I approved it, I wasn't thinking. My head was pounding. I wasn't even sure of the rules of selling alcohol to a drunk person, all I was 100% clear on was the age requirements.

  
Later on, when I saw that man walk out, I asked the guy working next to me in the cafe, I think he was drunk. He said I shouldn't have sold it but he may just act like that. Later, I told the supervisor this.  
Fast forward, this man ended up sleeping in the toilets. He walked out, but he must've finished drinking what I approved and came back in to sleep in the toilets. Long story short, the manager was off that day but they were in shopping and ended up waking him up. They thought he was dead. They then sat him down and gave him something to drink. When I saw this, I was mortified. When he sobered up, he tried to buy another bottle of alcohol but was stopped by the supervisor. They called a taxi for him to go home.

  
The supervisor ended up telling the manager what I did, even before they discovered him. I got in a lot of trouble. I know, I shouldn't have done it and I didn't make excuses or blame anyone for it. I was then put into an investigation meeting, but before, during, and after this my manager was very personal with me.

  
They said they thought he was dead, and if he died, I would have to live with that. It's haunting me how I could've killed someone. If he had collapsed or gone to hospital, I would have to live with that and have the police investigate me, fine me, and hold me responsible and I would have a criminal record which would affect me for the rest of my life. I can't stop thinking about it now about how serious it was.

  
I keep thinking about the alternatives like what if I didn't tell anyone that I knew he was drunk - I wouldn't have got into trouble. Other people told me I should've kept quiet and when i read about this online, everyone says just to say you didn't know he was drunk and deny everything. In truth, my head was dazed, pounding from the lack of sleep and I wasn't 100% sure, he wasn't stumbling, unable to get up etc. It was the gut feeling I had, and that led to my admission I shouldn't have made.  
What if I had just refused it. I should've quit the job when I first wanted to a month in, but I carried on despite how it's some minimum wage job. What if he had died and I would be investigated and caught by the police. But then I also think, that he was just sleeping in the toilets, and many people do that when they're drunk (described as semi-conscious in the investigation meeting). I can't stop thinking about how I nearly killed someone. Or did I...? He wasn't that drunk, not enough to die from it I think... It's not like he struggled to even walk out of the store and he seemed fine, he was able to sit on a high chair to sober up immediately after...  


The other thing is what my manager said to me:  
Are you like this in every job you have?  
I think you'll be like this in every job you have - I am just starting my career btw, so this stings, as I am looking for graduate roles  
have you always been like this?  
how are you going to do other jobs?  
I feel like you don't get the job.  
do you see yourself as a victim quite a lot - NO, as everyone can see, i took full responsibility, never blamed anyone. All I said was I couldn't care less of the humiliating and condescending way the investigation meeting went. even writing this post describing my guilt - people may think it means im playing the victim.

  
I should've not gone to the investigation meeting at all since it was over before it started. People there were very condescending, and I took full responsibility and admitted it.  
I am really struggling with my thoughts now. For my peace within myself, I hope I am able to forgive and learn from this.  
\*Edit: I forgot to mention, it is illegal to do what I did\*"
"So I got banned from the LDR sub today for asking a mod a question. I never posted it within the sub because my question was strictly against the rules. 

After it happened, I was REALLY pissed. Probably disproportionately so, but nevertheless. Throughout the day, I haven't been reflecting on it or anything, but whenever I remember what happened, I seriously just feel like I've been fired without an excuse. That's the feeling I get off it. 

Because, after talking with the mod who ended up banning me, the literal only reason they can give me about why I've been banned is ""you shouldn't want to pursue an LDR"". I feel like I got banned by someone still in their feelings about a relationship that didn't go right, or someone really young. 

Who tf bans someone based off their feelings and takes away a whole community of resources because ""I shouldn't want one""? I've tried reasoning with them, I've tried begging (because anything else does the opposite 🙄), and now I'm just sad and burnt out because I am NOT looking for people in my area. I can make another account and just post with that but this is my main account.... I just think it's all unfair and unnecessary. 

Not asking for anything in particular, maybe just some empathy. I'll probably feel better after some sleep, but this really... Just got me for some reason today."
"Hi, 

So this is going to be a long one.

I hope I get some replies out of this, I am feeling down and anxious.

To give some context: From the summer until late November I was employed at a local gas station. Although I had a good classification in my degree, I wanted to earn some money working part time so I could fund my driving lessons and whilst I would search for a full time graduate role (neither of those things happened).

I hated that job but it paid for my driving lessons so I continued. I didn't want to do it. I also thought it could improve some soft skills. All it did was give me anxiety and triggered symptoms of panic attacks both there and a few days ago, that I never had before. I wasn't a bad employee on purpose, I was there all the time and never slacked. I just did things slower. It started with coworkers not wanting to work with me when the stock came in every morning, then them talking behind my back. Manager started to call me slow when I was doing stock. Etc. But I always tried to be the bigger person and just take it, pretend I didn't hear. Customers gave me anxiety to the point where I would breathe in a paper rolled up in a tube once.

In November last year I was extremely tired. My shift started at 6am. I was going to walk to work which would take 50 minutes and in the freezing cold and dark. I couldn't sleep anyway until 4am because of the anxiety and worries about customers. My sibling ended up driving me. When I got there, I remember I drank a coffee even though caffeine triggers my anxiety, so I was really tired. The supervisor chose anyone but me to help him unload the stock.

Let me first say I am in no way denying or pushing the blame onto anyone else and this happened at the time as well, I just took all the insults the manager threw at me without disagreeing.

Around 7am, a customer came in by himself, he looked drunk. He kept staring at the hot foods for an unusually long time. When he bought beer - I think it was that - I sold it to him. When he turned around he stumbled a tiny bit. This is when I should've stopped him or rang the bell for the supervisor to come. I sold him it. I wasn't quite sure of the rules, and plus it was broken all the time in the store. My colleagues would approve people to buy alcohol and nicotine even if they looked under 25 (rule is to ask if they look under 25 but have to be 18). They have never refused anyone and neither have I, so it was in my nature just to approve it. After he walked out - I saw him - I asked the person next to me if I should've done that, he said no. I then asked the supervisor when he came up. Later the manager came to buy some food on her day off, then she discovered him in the bathroom, asleep - or semi-conscious as they exaggerated. 

Skipping forwards, I was then put into an investigation meeting on Teams with another manager and a note taker. I should've quite before this but I decided to be respectful to the manager and give my 4 weeks notice. She was very condescending. She asked me questions like how do you feel, what do you think will happen, why did you do it, didn't you do the training. Then they came back and gave me a disciplinary meeting some time later. I talked to my manager and said I am not doing that. Back and forth then I just said I'm leaving right now.

She then decided to berate me very personally. She said:

Are you like this in all the jobs you have

I think you'll be like this in all the jobs you have

How are you going to do other jobs? Oh, you want to take a break now? What about after, will you just take another break?

You're not really there

Do you see yourself as a victim quite a lot?...Not other times, just this time? When I said I don't understand why all this has happened - not that I didn't, my mind was just fogged after all of it and I was mumbling nonsense. She added 'just this time' after I paused to stare at her because I mentioned before I had a video call where I blamed for sexual assault and this triggered it a lot with the way they treated me.

Suggested me to work in a call centre despite how I have an Honours Law degree because of my anxiety with customers.

Later on that day she messaged me asking for an emailed resignation letter but I ignored it.

The thing that triggered me the most was how she said 'I think you'll be like this in every job you have'. I am applying to graduate roles now and I am finding it hard to even look at jobs and apply. Because this sentence is ingrained in my mind, and this job has genuinely triggered anxiety which I have NEVER felt in my life. I swear, I have never even mentioned or thought about anxiety in myself before I had this job. I can't sleep at night because I'm worrying. 

I told a relative this and she said to not let this affect my future job prospects and I need to move on from it. I can't stop thinking about how will I do other jobs? She said how could I do other jobs... Like I am useless... I will be like this in every job I have... Plus the jobs I am applying for right now are in law firms, as assistants so there's a lot of admin and interacting with clients. I can't, clients give me too much anxiety. I am already thinking of going into research

Feel regret over what I did. If he had died or went into a coma I would've had a criminal record and would live with that. As the manager told me.

I have 1 friend who doesn't care much about me. I remember on the day I quit I asked if he could call me, he said ok but never did. He won't come to see me, I came to see him last time..

How do I try to move past this? How do I stop this anxiety?

"Since last May I've studied an online course in software testing with prospects of employment if i pass all the stages. It's a free course, so they have interviews after each stage, which decide if you can go on. 

Tomorrow is the first interview where they will check my knowledge, not just have a personal talk. There will be a personal talk too, though. I don't know which causes me more anxiety. 

Anyway, i had postponed this interview for 2 months because of my physical and mental health, which was made worse by my mother, who is abusive. But recently i got too worried they'd kick me from the course if i put it off any longer, and asked them to set the date for the interview. And so it is tomorrow. 

I had a lot to review, and am still reviewing stuff today. But my mother actively prevents me from studying. She verbally and physically attacks me. I'm still trying my best to study.

Wish me luck, i don't have anyone else to ask it seems."
"I have experienced a wide range of grief for deaths of beloved family members, colleagues, classmates, friends, one was even an unexpected car accident. I understand that even if the circumstances were identical and the relationships were comparable, no two deaths or grieving journeys are the same.

However, I have never felt the magnitude of pain, shock, and disorientation that I felt 10 days ago when I woke up to the news that my aunt (my mom’s youngest sister without kids of her own, the “fun aunt”) died suddenly and unexpectedly while dozing off watching football on the couch. Her longtime partner, who is also like an aunt to me too, tried to wake her up so she could move into the bed. She wasn’t “young” in the sense that she was over 60, but she was still way too young, too healthy, too full of life, to die so randomly. I was extremely close with her; even my other family members and her partner of 37 years have acknowledged that this loss must be especially hard for me. She was my first friend. She was like a second mom and big sister rolled up in one during my formative coming of age years, she continued to support and love me through my questionable teen and college days, and simply put, she is undoubtedly a core part of who I am and have grown into as a human being. I always thought she’d be there with me through some of the tougher years ahead if I ever have to care for my parents as they age (already in their 70s). I always thought, without hesitation or complaint, that I would eventually be taking care of her as well… in about 20-25 years. 

I’m looking into getting professional help from a grief counselor that specializes in trauma associated with sudden bereavement down the line (as I’m even more worried about my mental state in the next months after the dust has settled) — but I’m using this post as a stepping stone to see how comfortable I am opening up to totally objective parties. 

Ok top if this, my boyfriend of six months is super sweet and I know he means well. He’s also 10years younger, which surprisingly doesn’t mean him being emotionally immature (he is actually really open about feelings including how much he cares about me) — but more so I keep making unfair judgments that he is like inexperienced so now it just feels like everything he attempts to do is wrong for me. I realize how this sounds, but I’m not myself or in logical mind to control or comprehend how I feel at any given moment. (Even if he was experienced with supporting a grieving loved one, I don’t even know what I need, so it might not even apply here, I’m just so lost and broken.) The point is that ALMOST everything he does and says now seems annoying even though I know in my heart he loves me and is trying to support me. I don’t expect him to be a mind reader or a punching bag, but I can’t seem to help but snap at him and push him out because I don’t have the capacity for his overall neediness and light hearted nature at this time. I have given him tasks that would be helpful for me at this time, and he tries his best to be thoughtful, and I know probably not all my frustrations towards him are rational, but I can’t help it. It’s not fair to him, and I don’t expect him to be perfect but weirdly when he’s not, I get super annoyed. 

I know I shouldn’t make rash decisions like dumping him or asking for a break (not because of him doing anything right or wrong but for him being maybe just not what I need right now and it not being fair to him.) I’m scared of who I will become not just at him but after all of this immediate shock and planning for the celebration of life etc. I don’t know yet how this grief will manifest in me and getting through each moment is an active challenge. I don’t know how many times I can communicate that to him. I’m barely holding it together. Sobbing while writing this.  He is patient and seems open to receive criticism, but I don’t even want to have to tell him how to show up for me and keep correcting him on things that aren’t helpful. It’s just sucking more of my depleted energy, between the shock and grief and sadness and comforting my family, feeling guilty about not being grateful enough to him, etc. is just an added layer. 

I’m sorry this post is long, I am a longtime Reddit lurker but not usually a poster. I don’t know what specific support or advice I’m asking for. Just an anonymous kind voice I guess. No preference on who that voice is, whether experienced in this specific form of grief or not. But bonus points for someone with close understanding of neurodivergence and long time anxiety disorder diagnosis and how these could interact with grief. 

Thanks for this community as a hopeful reminder there is still brightness in this cruel life. "
"I (18f) have been screwed over by the American Education System 3 times, and I'm done. I have gotten do close to graduating 3 times, but each time I've been told that my class credits are messed up and I will have to repeat a semester or year AGAIN. I am done with this bullshit. I am going to drop out, get a job, get a GED online, and when I get the chance I will buy a plane ticket to Europe and start a new life. 

My reasons? 
1) The people who ""represent"" the citizens of this country have made it very obvious that they don't actually represent us. 
2) It is so fucking expensive just to live here. Minimum wage cannot support A SINGLE PERSON. 
3) I don't want to work myself into a grave. It's part of the American way to break my back working a 9-5 (more like 6-6) until I am 70 years old just to have the CHANCE to rest in my old age. 
4) The work force has become so toxic and disgusting. Just look up why people don't want to work anymore. 
5) Healthcare sucks donkey balls! All this ""out of network"" shit, and medical negligence. Not to mention how expensive it is. NO THANK YOU! 
6) Employers will throw your college degree back in your face and tell you to fuck off, because you don't have enough experience. This is for ENTRY LEVEL JOBS! 
7) All this political shit isn't worth it. George Washington said that splitting into political parties would ruin this country, and it is. 
8) I want to actually be able to achieve my dreams, and that is not possible here. I want to be mentally and financially stable, but with how Healthcare, economics, and the workforce are going, I won't reach my goals until I'm in my late 60's. And I don't want to have to wait that damn long. 

There's a better way to live somewhere else, and I'm going to find it."
"Right now, I live in a big city. I made a promise to myself to go here 8 years ago and I made it 3 years later. 

But now I've been fired by my job last month and no job offer so far. My family told me to go home, but I don't want to give up on my dreams. Right now, it's very difficult for me to make a choice, and I need someone to talk right now."
A question myself and if I fit in in the world. I'm pretty old and I still haven't really adapted to society. I've always gotten by on being a cookie type of person however I really don't know who I am deep down. I've suffered a lot of Abandonment trauma so it's really hard to trust people and build relationships. I'm starting to realize that I'm truly alone nowadays. I wish I had connections and family and stuff like that. I do get out and take care of my mental health. I've gone to like a thousand meetups. The truth is I just don't like 99% of people. I don't really feel safe being close to people unless it's super special situations like therapy or something. I'm getting to a point of desperation. I'm finding myself addicted to a variety of silly things like watching TV and social media. I feel ashamed of this because I always believed in keeping my mind clean and staying in touch with my Divine source and simplicity. However I don't really walk my talk. I'm honestly pretty disappointed in my life however maybe I should take a step back and admit that my expectations were kind of high given what I've started with. I don't even know if there's any point to such a post. There's probably a million people like me and I might not even want to be friends with them lol. But I do need connection so it's kind of confusing and weird
"My older brother who we will call J died at age 18, he died earlier today and my mom is devastated. I wasn’t close to J as he lived in Mexico and didn’t really talk to him. I am upset about this whole situation, but not nearly as much as my mother. I’m not sure how to help her, we convinced her to eat as my aunt came over to visit due to the whole situation. I was going to suggest to her we watch a show to distract her, and try to act normal to make her feel better, but chose against it because I wasn’t sure if it was going to make her feel worse. I just want advice on how to distract her from the whole situation even for a little bit. Can you guys give me advice on how to help my mom?
I can give more info if suggested, I’m just not sure how many details one would wanna hear. We shared a birthday too(me and J), it’s in a couple weeks, and I’m not sure how it’s going to all work out, and I don’t want to be an inconvenience on the day. I just need a little bit of guidance, I don’t want to talk about this to anyone in my personal life because I know everyone would get uncomfy w the subject, especially at school, and I just want a sense of normalcy in my life during these times. I’ll be happy if I get even a couple answers on here, please help me. 

Side note: if you see this on other subreddits it’s because I’m putting it on more than one so I can hopefully get more answers."

"I have had the worst year of my life so far F (53). My marriage off 22 years ended, my Dad had a stroke and is now in full time care, every job interview I went to, I didn’t get and I just recently found out my boyfriend cheated on me with a co-worker.  

I’m feeling sad, lonely and really need a hug."
"I (22f) live with my older sister (31f) and niece (12f). My sister and I were verbally, emotionally and physically abused by our mother. My sister has become the typical “the abused becomes the abuser” and lashes out on my niece the same way our mother did to us. I talk to my niece a lot and she confides in me about everything. The way it makes her feel, the horrible thoughts she has at her young age, etc. It’s heartbreaking. She cries to me saying she wants to run away or die. And I can’t do shit about it. 

Just now I hear my sister shouting obscenities at her and at our 5 month puppy. If our puppy barks she’ll shout at then top of her lungs “shut the fuck up!” and then at my niece “shut him the fuck up! why are you letting him bark! make him shut up!!!!” and I can’t do anything about it. I tried calling 911 10 min ago pretending I was a neighbor saying I was concerned for the child but they sent me to the non emergency line, and I never got an answer. I can hear the puppy crying and whimpering and I can hear my niece crying as well. It pains me like nothing I’ve ever felt before because I can’t do shit. If I try consoling her, my sister will shout at me and say “don’t baby her!! it’s none of your fucking business” She is just like our mother. It’s reliving trauma and watching the person you love the most live through the same thing as well. And you can’t do shit to stop it."
Never has a real friend in my life. The people I care about all end up leaving me. I don't know when or if I will ever find the people who will stick around.
"I love hearing about what people think, and why they thought that. Hearing about it is so beautiful to me and it opens up so much about a person. I like to understand everything about they're made up by, what they would do in such situation, how they act around different people, and their variety of feelings about things. I love reading books about how different people would interact with one another. It makes me sound like such a nerd but I cant help but love breaking down people into what they really are, and why they ended up the way they are now."

I’ve been shut at home for so long. I can hardly go to school because I’m so sick. The last time I made a freind on Reddit it turned out he was trying go groom me. But you knwo what? I have no one else. So whatever. Message me plesee. I don’t care if I end up being raped at the end of it. I need to talk to someoen. Anyone.
Moved back in with family during the summer because of an abusive relationship and got fired from a job last month. It was a good thing because the environment wasn’t healthy but I feel so lost. I’ve made no friends since I moved and can’t seem to get outside the house. I know I have it good but I feel really lonely. It’s hard to meet people.

my bf passed away due to suicide about 2 months ago, and i've had nightmares about it since. i've just been questioning if he really loved me despite substantial proof that he did now that he's gone. i'm just confused and so tired of everything."
"Hey! It’s a difficult time of the year for so many of us that are struggling. It was real bad for me this time last year, and I’m so thankful that I have been able to crawl out of that space and am truly happy now. I remember how difficult it was and that sometimes I just wanted a stranger to talk to. So here I am, I’m P, 30 M and am here to listen. I’m here to talk. I’m here to cry if you need someone to just cry to. I’m here to just let you know, that no matter how bad it feels, you’re not alone. I’m with you. :)"
"Hello everyone,

I'm here to offer a compassionate ear and a safe space for anyone who needs it. Whether you're dealing with personal struggles, relationship issues, work stress, or anything else on your mind, I'm here to listen. 

No matter the topic or the complexity of the problem, I believe everyone deserves a non-judgmental and understanding person to share their thoughts with. 

You're not alone in this.

Remember, it's okay not to be okay. 

Don't hesitate to DM me if you need someone to talk to."
"I’m so tired of feeling so much. But, I think I’ll delete this account now. I think i’ve had a fair share of my expressed phase here. I’ll forever be grateful for that, yeah. 


Thanks Reddit, you provided me a great platform to vent out and be my vulnerable self. 

You let me write out things which I could express none. You were my little sad journal book which I was not afraid to hide in my room. 

You let me realise that the world is such a big place, and there’s always room for more, and that when you feel that you’re going through the worst thing possible, there’s always someone out there who’s facing more even worse. It made me realise to be thankful for things I wouldn’t have been for otherwise.

Not to forget, I met some really kind and humble people here. When I was young my mom always used to tell me to not talk to strangers. And yet here was I, talking to strangers who made me feel home which even people I knew for years couldn’t. 

Thanks Reddit, you saved me when I was drowning. And I don’t think i’ll ever forget that.


Forever grateful &lt;3

"(burner account because reasons) I am a 38M and have been with my wife for a little over 5 years and married for a little over 2.5 years. In the past few days I have started to come to the realization that I may be in an abusive relationship. I don't trust myself and my judgement enough to say for sure; I've known some things were toxic for a long time but have never been long to call it abusive, but some recent events have gotten me to begin to see some things that I have let go/dismissed/made excuses for in the past in a new light.  Talking to my sister today was the first time I told anybody that I think I may be dealing with actual abuse. I am very unsure of myself right now and even more unsure what to do. We have a 2.5 year old son who is my world, which complicates things a lot for me. I don't know what to do. I would appreciate anyone who is willing to talk (over 25 preferably, but definitely over 18, respectfully). I may not be able to respond right away, but I promise I will respond if anyone is kind enough to reach out. Thank you so much in advance! "

"I don't to talk about DMs. I'm happy to comment on this thread. 

I do not know if it's just me but since I was a kid, I never felt anybody truly appreciated my existence. I never receive gifts. I never get a compliment on my looks. I never have someone who wants to meet me. I never have someone who wants me and desires me. I never have someone who wants to see and meet me. I never have someone who wants to spend time with me. 

I'm doing really well in my life. Physical health, hygiene, hobbies, job, finances, etc. But, as a guy, I don't think anyone cares about my existence. I feel an little pebble on the side of a road that nobody notices. I feel invisible.

No I'm not stuck at home all day. Every evening I have something to do. I come across several people and interact with several people every day and over the weekend. But I don't feel anyone genuinely wants me apart from women who pretend to be interested just for attention which is worse."

I don't remember too much I must of been in and out of consciousness. I think he came in and out of the room though the night? I don't remember but I'm pretty sure he tried a few times. I remmeber trying to stop him, mumbling, trying to pull my shorts up. Get away. I woke up on the couch so I must've drunken got up and away and gone into the lounge, safe from his hands. He graped me.i don't know if I can ever tell my friend or her sister. They have 4 beautiful kids and I don't want to break there family. But I feel broken, violated, and sick"
"As my title says I just have a lot I wanna get off my chest. 

2024 is officially the worst year of my life, kinda almost funny since 2023 was the best year of my life. 

The start of this year was me getting evicted from my dream apartment in February, I was so close to work I could walk, my girlfriend also worked with me so she stayed over almost every night, life seemed perfect. 

After the eviction I was struggling to find anywhere to live, I kinda floated between motels, air bnbs etc. 

While staying at one of the air bnbs I got fired from my job, so already stressed as I was, I’m not unemployed and homeless. 

Eventually my aunt told me to move down by her(over 700 miles away) so I did and for context I take care of my disabled father so he was with me during the eviction and moving around places. 

The one good thing I had going at that time was my girlfriend, who truth be told I was not treating her properly, I was also a huge alcoholic, as well having untreated mental illness. When I told her I was moving she understandably did not wanna do long distance so she broke up with me. 

So I was moving to a new area I’ve never been, with the only people I’d know being family I haven’t seen in years. 

Well it’s been around 6 months, I can’t find a job due to the shaky job market, I’m being a burden at home, and this whole months been a disaster my dad was in the icu after his heart stopping during surgery, he’s finally recovering and coming home soonish, but I learned it’ll be even harder to take care of him, he needs a walker, he needs oxygen, a special bed, a shower chair, and many other things. I lovey father to death but I also recognize the burden that this will be on me unfortunately. 

And the last straw for me this year was my cat passing away on Tuesday. I noticed over the weekend she seemed different, then I found her breathing faintly and clearly not feeling well, we took her to the emergency vet where they admitted her thinking she was just dehydrated and needed to be observed, they ran blood test but by the time they came back she had passed away from a kidney disease. 


I don’t really know if any of this is coherent or anything it’s hard to sort my thoughts, I just kinda wanted to put this out in the world. "

"TW: suicidal 

Hi. 18m here. Im sorry this post is long but im begging for someone to read it and have any advice. Im desperate. 

I’m convinced, at this point, that there is a fundamental flaw with my brain that’s incapable of being treated.

Quick background on me:
I grew up in a nasty home with a horrible stepfamily that abused and neglected me. Never been close with my parents, been through quite a lot of trauma. The bad step family is gone now after an incident that caused my mum to divorce my stepdad.

I was always an insanely anxious kid. I was diagnosed with OCD at a young age and was almost constantly having a breakdown. I’d convince myself that aliens replaced my parents, that I was terminally ill, that I couldn’t trust anyone, that my dad would die because I felt convinced one morning that he would that day. I had a difficult time distinguishing being reality and fiction up until the age of 10. 

My parents never sought out therapy for me, because frankly I don’t think they cared enough. My mum only loved me when I was ‘easy’ for her. If I showed signs of ‘weakness’ like crying or being scared I’d get scolded.

I told my dad I wanted to die when I was 11. Certain colours make me anxious, times of day make me depressed. Anything unfamiliar terrifies me.

When I was 17, after advocating for myself, alone, I was diagnosed with autism, and later told I have ADHD too. I’m not even making this up, I feel like a freak. Who had OCD, Autism AND adhd??

SSRI’s have no affect on me. I developed panic attacks in 2020 and because I had no support, thought the best thing I could do was avoid any triggers, FOR YEARS, leading to me basically being housebound.

I have a fear of vomiting, and this year I developed an eating disorder because of it. 

About 2 months ago I started paying for therapy out of pocket, and my therapist has been nice but I’ve yet to notice improvement (understandably though because it’s only been a short time). My therapist (and doctor) are very convinced I need ADHD meds but unfortunately it’ll take months and months and months to get (possibly 2 years).

So, how the fuck am I meant to do anything right now?? My friends are off in university, while my biggest challenge is eating a sandwich. 

I NEED to move out. My household makes me miserable and I need independence. Yet- I can’t be in the car for more than 10 minutes, have the attention span of a fly, and most days can’t get out of bed.

Truly I want to kill myself. There’s no other way to put it. I’ve never experienced life happily and doubt it’s gonna change. I’m in such a deep hole right now and it keeps getting worse. I’m trapped in this stupid fucking house which might as well be my grave. Every aspect of my life is disordered and I’m angry and bitter and jealous and want to scream.

"Have something you need to get off your chest? Lonely and need to burn some time talking about your favorite things to do? Need some outside, unbiased input on something random going on in your life?

I feel like this is reading like an infomercial, but seriously.. life is tough and it’s easy to get trapped in the feeling that we’re all alone in this world. Being neurodivergent myself, I understand this all too well. 

I’m 34, live in the US, and currently going through a divorce. I’d like to say I’m pretty emotionally aware, but I’m no therapist. I’ll let you know if something makes me uncomfortable to talk about, but please don’t let that stop you from asking and seeking additional help elsewhere.

You did the right thing by reading this.

It's time to take that burden off.

You've done enough, as it is.

You know this, and so do I.

Rest, now. You earned it. Close your eyes, and simply breathe.

Again.

I know it's hard.

I know it's not easy.

I know it's almost always a struggle,

I hope this helped. I hope you know your worth. You are valuable. You deserve those breaks. Please treat yourself. Everything is going to work out soon, okay?

"This is just a big vent/rant. I'm tired/lost and hurt. 

Wife moved down here. Was in the middle of her degree. Didn't like her degree path. 

Had financial trouble with degree. Decides to pause. 

When asking her if she wants to resume, she promises me she wouldn't resent me for discontinuing. I didn't want her moving down here and stopping degree to be my fault. 

I guess it is anyways, though. 

She gets a job, schedule conflicts with my own severely. We only see each for an hour or so some weeks. She lingers at home before leaving, too much tardiness abd gets fired.


She leaves and leaves her ring.

She didn't like the pressure I was putting on her to be more consistent with her job, I guess. I grew up in a military family, I talk roughly. I get that, but I didn't know it was an issue.


She cones back, and I assure her that her value doesn't come from her work. 

I try to push her for more simple stuff at home, maybe boost her self esteem again.

Garden, hydroponics, cooking, etc. 

She isn't consistent with those, and that wasn't a problem until she insisted on cooking my lunches but didn't always deliver, forcing me to figure something out last minute. 

I try to cook my own lunch, but I guess I said it wrong and she's upset about that, I feel bad and let her continue and problems continue. 

I'm blindsided now. She's gone again.

I work a lot, about 60 hours a week on a rotating schedule. I haven't had a day off in 13 days. Still have 14 until i get a day off. 


It's hard, I get it.

I'm ADHD, I'm emotional.

I'm oversimplifying, and she has validity to her issues...

But why is it always a blindside?
Why can't we talk first?
Why is it always just you leaving out of the blue?
I thought we vowed till death do us part?
If being scared of a hard conversation is all it takes, what the hell will the next 40 years look like? 

I know I'm ""mean,"" and brutally honest, but I'm not heartless or unreasonable. I only ever wanted you to be happy.

Wverything I'm doing is for you.

The hours, the sleeplessness, the foodless 12hr shifts, the emotional suppression...

Why do you now say I'm controlling?
Why do you now say I'm selfish?
Why, when I tried my best to do everything I could to support safe decisions, do you say I'm not interested in your future?

I never said don't work, I never said to not go to college... 

I just presented you with information. I never made those decisions.

I dunno. 

I wrote over 60 questions I have.

Why can't I have an understanding?

I'm begging for the ability to do what you want.

You won't even let me slave for you the best I can. 

I hate where I'm at, I hate my hours, I hate my life, I hate my path forward...

But I want to give you the freedom to do anything.

Work, don't work, college no college, research no research, I just try to push you into the thinys YOU told me you liked.

Why tell me things you don't want?

Forcing me to become the asshole based off bad information 

I offer to do everything myself, you say no. 

JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT. I'LL FUCKING DO IT. I'VE BEEN TRYING.

"So my(26F) ex (27M) brokeup with me a year ago, back then I didn't have a job and had to go through a surgery, he left exactly when i needed him the most.
After that we had limited contact 

Recently he had started seeing someone else and was pretty serious about her. And probably she left him to marry someone else.

He called me and said the way he did to me, the girl did to him..
I have long forgiven him and moved on 

But after that call, i started getting anxiety again, i previously had anxiety and had taken therapy for it.

I don't know what his intentions are, just that thinking about all this makes me anxious 
And i had specified 3months back that we should go no contact.


Edit: guys i have blocked him"
I'm still grieving my dad and grandparents passings even though it's been some time. They were my closest family and their losses has effected me so much to this day. Very recently I lost my best friend. I had known her for 8 years and my feelings were so strong that I had to let them out and I was rejected. We are currently taking a break and it just hurts so much. I've never been in a relationship and I feel like I never will be in one. I have very few friends left as most have left me over time. Work has been extremely stressful on me. It's so hard because of my anxiety and depression. My family is very unsupportive. We just had to get surgery for our dog and it was successful but we also found out that he has kidney disease. This is also effecting me poorly on top of everything else. I just could really use some support right now from a kind voice. Thank you. 
"I could really use a good word, she texted me and its making my heart jump.

I dont want to read the message. She texted me through reddit chat and so i opened a throwaway account so I dont have to look at even the little new message icon.

She fucking cheated on me. And then for months there was a back and forth, sleepless nights wishing I could hear something from her.

But now Ive finally gotten to a place where, jesus, I can at least survive, where I can at least get through my months instead of my minutes. I dont want to lose whatever stability Ive gotten.

But at the same time I have this nagging curiosity . . . the first line reads ""We need to talk. I have something important I want to talk abt. Please PM me."" it was actually a reply to a post I'd made, and then she sent me a pm that I dont want to open.

It sounds . . . urgent. Like what if its about an std? Or something actually concerning to my wellbeing?

Or maybe its something thats going to destroy my spirit again . . . like for whatever reason shes going to tell me that shes marrying that piece of shit, or that they've broken up, or that she finally she found a scrap a remorse lying in that dark pit she calls a soul.

Im trying to convince myself that I dont need to talk to her, that I dont need to know what shes said, that whatever it is, the likliness that its actually something important to my wellbeing is so low that its not worth me getting my soul torn apart again.

Somebody please just talk to me about this im freaking out rn



UPDATE: The message request wasnt from her! It was from a different account asking me about something completely else. thank fuck. "
"my best friend and i have a complicated and difficult relationship. we dated for about a year, but broke up last september after i found out he was cheating on me. 

we started seeing each other again a few months ago and recently had more discussions about our future. we agreed that neither one of us was in the right place mental health-wise for a relationship, but that we wouldn’t see or speak to others romantically / sexually. i told him i had not seen or spoken to anyone since may and he assured me the same was true for him and that this would continue. 

i know this on me, because that is a very messy situation but i wanted to believe that he was telling the truth and have hope for a better future together. but this morning i found out that he was lying and was talking to other women again. 

i confronted him, but i wasn’t angry and we didn’t fight. i repeatedly told him that i wasn’t mad, just hurt, but that it was ok and i understand he has his flaws. i started getting ready for work, and i think he may have taken something while i was in the shower because when i got out he was nodding off and saying he wanted to be voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital. i can’t help but feel that him seeing how much he hurt me contributed to this. 

i contacted his parents and close friends and brought him to the hospital, but had to leave to go to work after a few hours. i made sure his friend would be with him until i could come back. while i was at work, the hospital ended up discharging him to his parents. this was actually my first time meeting both his friend and his parents; i had to go through his phone and contact everyone to make sure he wouldn’t be alone there. 

now he is home with his parents, but i’m terrified he might do something again. he has attempted suicide twice in the past 4 years. i don’t have any close friends here to support me and i don’t feel comfortable asking his parents or friends to be comforting me right now, because his needs are obviously the priority. 

i am heartbroken and worried and i feel so alone. on top of this, ive been dealing with a resurgence of my ptsd causing 3+ panic attacks every day and severe insomnia. if anyone is available to chat it would mean so much to me"

"At 26 years old I'm still single. I've tried dating for the past year or so but I haven't had much luck. Or rather, I don't enjoy it because I just lack the skills for it. And if I'm being entirely honest with myself, I think I'm also just scared of falling for someone. 

I've had a pretty lonely childhood which does explain things, but the knowing alone is not enough to improve things. I lack a lot of social skills: I have a poorly developed sense of humor, I don't know how to get close to people (or I avoid it), I'm aloof and distracted, and sometimes I just don't know how to talk. My sentences come out jumbled and incomplete, and I get told often by people they couldn't understand what I was saying.

I sometimes get sad knowing there are more than enough single people out there who also don't have their life together, and who feel a bit sad about it like I do. Hell, maybe they even think they can't find love either. 

And then there's just the plain fact that I'm unsure I'll even be able to meet the people who are right for me. Find them. I don't think they're super common. I'm scared they won't find me because on the outside I look put together and I exude no shred of personality. I'm scared of people not being interested in me because I'm not well put together on the inside either, like my flaws are unattractive. And while that might be true, I also know that so many people who are way worse messes than I am get together all the time and can be some sort of happy. I just don't know if *I* can change enough to ever be lovable or love, for that matter...

"I am a 32 years old unmarried, childless man and I am currently feeling lost in life. Therefore, and facing some embarrassment at first, I picked up the courage to seek professional support from a therapist for the first time in my life. Nonetheless, I've decided to post here in order to get additional advice from both men and women who are part of this community.

I think that my current feeling of being lost (or left behind) in life mainly stems from two circumstances: mild bullying which resulted in the inability to fully experience my teenage years if and when I compare them with the ones experienced by my peers and the loss of my father due to cancer when Covid-19 was ravaging in 2020. The first circumstance, in fact, turned me from a quite extroverted and carefree boy into an introverted, overthinking and resentful man while the second one wreaked havoc in my everyday life as I abruptly lost one of the most important people I was attached to in a phase in which everyone is supposed to settle down both personally and professionally. Cancer is basically like having to deal with a time bomb where you cannot see the timer and this puts you face to face with the precariousness of life.

Those events profoundly affected me, as I practically spent my teenage years most of the time alone focusing on my studies and these last years trying to settle down professionally facing great difficulties in both dealing with people (as I work in Sales &amp; Distribution) and life itself. There are days in which I feel completely absorbed by what I am doing and therefore I manage to get things done as expected without having to deal with what my therapist calls ""intrusive thoughts"" and others in which I feel overwhelmed by a hurricane of negative thoughts and sensations about myself and the future ahead of me that make me cry silently on my pillow as soon as I get home at the end of the day.

I deeply regret the fact of not having been able to experience love in its blossoming, intense and raw nature during my teenage years, unlike my peers, the fact that those times and hangouts will never come back again thus leaving a deep scar inside my heart and lastly, the fact that I am very often going to be at unease in social settings when acquaintances/colleagues etc. discuss about their family, children and career prospects. At the same time I also drastically reduced the amount of time I spend on social media as people just seem to share the good things in their lives, but I always try to take any opportunity to hang around my friends and family members, even if some of them are starting a family and this makes me feel at unease as I previously explained. Going out for dinner/ a movie/ a play at the theatre all by myself is too much for me to handle and, quite frankly, humiliating at the moment. Casually going out for some drinks or travelling instead, are more manageable activities but come with some strain as well.

I'd like to become more optimistic and resilient in order not to find myself alone and hopeless as I reach maturity and retirement. What advice would you give me? Thank you for your help and please forgive me if I made some mistakes but I am not a native English speaker."

"hello sorry if this is the wrong spot but someone had suggested i post here. i never would have actually thought about posting my personal life but here i am. i know this is going to sound like teenage bullshit but it’s stressing me out so much i just need someone to be rational for me. for context i have major separation anxiety and abandonment issues and much more im not getting into. my boyfriend is pretty much the only person ive opened up to in this extent about this. i try my best not to be too needy or clingy, maybe too hard sometimes, but admittedly i do need him a lot. it feels like i cant ever be okay unless im with him. he’s the only person that can calm me down or give me any semblance of comfort.

so i was traveling for a month. i was super upset about it because id be away from him for so long. it already got me anxious thinking about it so i tried to spent the most of the time i could with him. unfortunately he was pretty busy. and i understand, he’s older and has shit to do. im finish with high school and college apps and have too much free time to be on my own. i was counting down the days to get back home. then he got mad at me for something and i got really distressed. then he had to travel, couldn’t call, but at least we could still message. i was still pretty shaken up. then i was super excited to come home because he would be coming home soon too. i was feeling so uneasy and was really waiting for a long time just to cuddle up with him. but then he told me his grandma had a medical emergency (she’s okay) and he had to stay for longer. he said he wouldn’t be able to message in a few days. it hurt so bad but i understand, of course it’s a reasonable request especially with what he was going through.

then he came back. i was hoping we could maybe meet soon. but then he didnt respond to any of my messages or calls for 3 days. we talk everyday and have never missed a single day since we started dating. i got really really paranoid and started thinking if something went wrong i completely spiraled. he then just messaged he was feeling sick. i understand that i overreacted and apologized. i requested if he could just say something once a day, even just a good morning or im busy, so i can know if he’s okay. i hate to be a demanding person, i dont want to ask for too much, but i was really hoping i asked for a simple enough request that he would agree to. he said he would keep it in mind, then didnt for the next 3 days. i got anxious again, he messaged that he’s too tired to talk. then we’re here now where he hasnt responded in 6 days. im a mess again. been having random panic attacks and nightmares, havent slept or ate well at all. been crying a lot lol.

i understand his circumstances, and i get if he wants his alone time, but i just want to hear from him. is that asking for too much? it’s been 2 weeks since we last were regularly talking. i dont even know if he’s okay right now….i overthink so much it drives me insane. am i supposed to be this worried? like what if something bad happened? but if not….is he not interested in me anymore? did he stop caring about me? its eating me up. i really dont know what i would do with myself if that’s true. i try so hard to be everything he wants i would do anything for him, but i keep feeling like i did something wrong and this is somehow my fault. i know im not being the most logical right now so i would really appreciate some advice"
"Realized the other day that I have completely squandered my life. 42 and nothing to show for it. No retirement savings, no house, no job, no friends, no SO, no social group.

I'm in a life situation where I NEED to be doing things to avoid homelessness...and I'm not doing anything, because I cannot make myself care. For 20+ years, I've lied myself back into action. Told myself I'm qualified, that I can fix things, that one day I'll get my act together, After all this faking? I have NOT made it. And there's nothing but static in my past. Entire years lost to dissociation.

"I left my first job today after 9 months. Cried for hours after my last shift with my manager. He’s someone who I don’t quite have enough in common with to maintain a friendship with (and it would be a little weird anyway, F19 and M25 - I don’t think his wife would like it) but he’s someone who I enjoyed my time with and wish I had worked with for longer. Over the last year he has been endlessly encouraging to me, helped me gain some needed confidence, and been understanding with my requests for altered shifts and hours due to various circumstances. On my induction I told him he reminded me of one of my college teachers, and he said he hoped he could be that kind of mentor figure to me. I will miss having that support, especially as I doubt I will have something like that from anyone at the new job.

I’ve always struggled majorly with saying goodbye to people. Leaving school/college was very difficult for me, mostly because of how many people I would just never see again because I wasn’t quite close enough to them to remain friends. When I was a child I would cry every time I had to say goodbye to a family member who I didn’t see so often, as at that point there was no guarantee to me that I would see them again.

At this point I am resigned to this reaction to goodbyes staying with me for the rest of my life. It is gutting every time"

"About a month and a half ago, my grandpa suddenly fell down. He was taken to a hospital and stayed there for a week or so. 

Since then, his health has been declining and he’s been in and out of the hospital. I don’t know his exact diagnoses, as my parents don’t communicate well with me but I watched him turn from a normal functioning person to someone who could no longer walk by himself, control his bladder, and became bed ridden all within weeks.

Two Fridays ago, he went back to the hospital after a nurse said something was very low and my grandma mentioned him not being able to open his mouth. Soon after I overheard my dad saying the name of the mortuary where we buried my mom. My grandma also started packing up all his belongings like my dad did when my mom passed. My heart instantly dropped thinking he had passed. However besides that, everyone in my family seemed normal/calm.

On Saturday, my grandma went to visit him in the hospital and she asked if I wanted to come. I said yes but she said to not go as my little brother would be home alone and there would be another time. I wish I would’ve pushed harder and just went. I knew I would probably regret not going because there wasn’t going to be another time. 

Today he passed away. 

I knew it was coming but it still seems too soon. He wasn’t getting any better. I think what also hurts is not knowing what his illnesses were. How did his health just deteriorate just like that? 
And why is everyone acting normal and calm? I’ve been crying all day. It just hurts so much.

My aunt once told me a while ago that I had a special place in his heart ever since I was a kid. I wouldn’t say we had a good relationship as we barely spoke, even though we lived together. Now all I feel is regret. I wish I could’ve done more to show him I appreciated and loved him. I have issues within myself and was prone to anger and being very quiet and isolated but I truly loved him and appreciated everything he did for me til the end. "

"I feel so fucking sick right now. I really shouldn't, but I do. First girlfriend I ever had was in college, seven years ago. After about a year, I broke it off, just wasn't emotionally invested in it, didn't want to waste my time or hers. She didn't take it well; we were best friends prior to the relationship, and I tried rekindling that, but she wanted none of it (understandable, in hindsight). Fine, whatever; we did contact each other a few times over the years, basic life updates, but nothing more. (I should also mention, I hold no ill will towards her. Broke up due to life/ personality differences, nothing malicious).

A few months ago, we saw each other again, at a college reunion thing. I approached her, tried speaking to her at it; she was polite, a but more receptive at least. After the fact, when I'd had a drink or two and it was getting late, I suggested we het lunch one day, catch up maybe one last time. Probably a stupid idea in hindsight, but I was nostalgic. She texted back, but, since I kind of regretted sending that message to begin with, I didn't open hers reply for like a month. Couldn't process the thought of whatever stupid shit I'd pitched to her, after everything.

Well, I just opened it now, kind of by mistake. It basically said ""lol, alright. Please don't contact me again."" It's been seven fucking years; we were best friends for one before that, dating for another. I've long since processed this whole thing, spoken about it in therapy multiple times. I've accepted that breaking it off was the correct thing for me to do (if perhaps a bit hasty at the time). But... this still hurts some other type of way. I've never dealt with an outright ""don't talk to me ever again"" order before. I've dealt with massive fear of rejection during my life, which is I guess is ironically why I couldn't completely cut contact with her, but... Jesus Christ, I guess this is some type of karma for me, some roundabout ""now you know how she felt"" shit. Fucking hell this sucks..."
"Hi! I’ve accidentally stumbled across this place and similar ones recently and I decided to post. But for this, I needed a throwaway. I post/comment on parenting subs and on my city one on my main. So as much as I know that the Internet is huge I want to be better safe than sorry. I’m sorry.

I’m Judith, and I recently turned 29 years old. I am married to the guy I fell in love with in high school. We happen to have two kids. One boy, one girl.

Life’s ok now. But there were times when it wasn’t. So, I’m here to help you. I’m quite bad with time management but I will try my best. 🤗"
"Hi! I'm a 22f who preparing to move cross country to go NC with my family and escape a toxic situation. I'm very scared right now. I'm moving to a new city where I know no one with no option to go back because I'm planning to cut off my entire family and everyone I know. Since I have to leave without my family knowing, I have to leave discreetly with plane and two suitcases. I'd have to leave my cats behind which is tearing me apart because they're the only form of love I have in my life. I don't really have any friends or access to a therapist. I feel so alone and some days it's so hard to have the will to keep going when I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. I wish I had someone to talk to, I don't know how to cope with these emotions. "
"Would like to talk about some important and some relatively less important stuff that bother me and make me a bit sad, but not in a very serious manner. Also, I'm bothered by things that might seem quite unrelated, but they are linked in an odd way. I just wanted to give heads up to anyone who would like to hear me out in advance so they don't get perplexed if the topic of the conversation changes suddenly.

Thanks!"
I don’t have any words to put behind the screaming that I feel in my soul anymore. I want someone to care but there’s no reason for any of you kind strangers to invest in the life of me. Anyway. I just wanted someone to know I relapsed and self-harmed for the first time in almost three years. I feel so overwhelmed in my life and hopeless and exhausted.
"I'm a 20 year old guy, turning 21 later this month, and have never been in a relationship. Never even kissed or have as much as held hands with a girl in a romantic context. I've had multiple crushes before, but it never became anything more than a crush because they only see me as a friend. People have been describing me as a very calm, friendly and nice guy for as long as I remember. I very rarely show frustration when I disagree with someone which means that the times I don't keep my opinion to myself or speak up about something, people are always very surprised.

I've been feeling very lonely romantically for quite a while now, it's never been as bad as it's been the past few months. All I want is to have someone to love who loves me back, someone I can go on romantic dates with, someone I can make beautiful memories with. But I think this craving and longing for love is turning me into a much more cynical person. Lately I've gotten so tired of people that I'm speaking up more when I feel something isn't right, but I've also had times where I did that for other reasons too. For example, my cousin's boyfriend was spewing his extreme fascist views again yesterday and I got into an argument with him about it. Not just because I obviously disagree with bigotry, but also because I hate people with big egos and wanted to hurt his massive ego. Or when I'm riding my bike and people don't get out of the way despite me ringing my bell multiple times and them walking on a bike road, I'll start saying how people need to get common sense and pay attention, hoping they hear it.

I know those examples aren't screaming ""asshole"" or whatever but I really dislike the fact that I'm becoming someone very cynical, and I think the lack of love is part of the cause. I have no clue how to change any of this and I know getting into a relationship probably isn't exactly a magic ""fix everything"" button either. I guess I feel very lost"
"I’m not usually the type to reach out when I need help but today is really heavy on me. I cried the whole way to the DMV so my picture is going to look worse than it already is and I have nobody I can talk to. I just want some positivity, uplifting words or personal experiences when things felt dark. Thank you to everyone who read this and replied."
"Hellouu, I'm happy to offer my DMs/Chat to anyone who needs a shoulder to lean or just wants to have a conversation with a stranger :)

I'll do my best to give advice, unless you don't want me to. Also, don't worry about being judged, I'm accepting of everyone! &lt;3"
"Tldr, don't want to explain it in detail for probably the hundredth time: Lost my sister a few years ago, my mom did her whole funeral and cremation, I had a very traumatic experience seeing her ashes and have never gotten over it, now my mom admits she regrets cremating her, there's nowhere around to bury her, we don't want to scatter the ashes, I hate having them in the house, everything is fucked.

I'm not even depressed but hell, last night was the first time in ages I actually considered trying to overdose. I hate the fact that I still get angry with my mom and hate myself for it. If she was a neglectful parent it would be easier but it'd the fact that she's not, she's nearly too kind, too sweet and innocent and it's why I just keep thinking like, god, why the fuck did she choose cremation? Nobody wanted it and she even admits she didn't want it and it was a bad idea looking back and I try not to think of my sister at all now and it's not my mom's fault but she's wonderful, but if I think about my sister, all I can see now is this clear plastic bag of ugly grey dust and that makes me get angry at my mom and she doesn't deserve it.

Fuck, I just want to vent. Three years of this crap, tons of therapy, counselling, family counselling, and I've never gotten over this and I can't heal properly because I haven't even gotten over the cremation, let alone the grief and even though the past few years have actually gotten a lot better, the *only* way I've been able to move on is by trying to block out all thr memories of my sister and acting like she never existed and i feel like a worthless pos for doing that now."
"I (29m) survived several instances of CSA (child sexual assault).  I’ve learned a lot and came to terms with it about 10 years ago but over the past year or so it seems to be really kicking my ass in a weird way.  I went right back to panic attacks, nightmares, aggression, and depression.  Then I relapsed on alcohol (other than that I’ve been sober for two and a half years), but the cool thing that happened with that was I actually felt like everything is good in the present.  I have a wife, kid, nice apartment, and bills are paid (though creeping).  

This week has been really rough though.  I got triggered again and I’m back to almost hourly nausea and wanting to rip my face off.  If I imagine that I was my younger self with the knowledge I have today, I’m begging you all for support and hugs.  I’m getting ready to cocoon in a heavy blanket"

"(First of all: I am going to therapy, just to get this out of the way. But I struggle to open up, it makes me feel sick, so that's why I'm here...)

Hey. This is really pitiful I suppose, but why do I feel so pathetic about my lack of a love life? Let me explain, I am aware that there are social expectations and whatever about what a ""normal adult life"" should be like which includes having a partner... But in my case it's strange because I don't think I want to be in a romantic relationship and share my life with someone else in that way. Isn't it contradictory? The thought of physical/sexual/romantic intimacy makes me feel sick. Yet at the same time, knowing I will always be alone in this way leaves me feeling very sad. How is this possible? I don't understand why I feel this way.

I think: am I sad that in some way deep down I feel deeply alone? Yes. But then: do I want to be intimate with someone else? God, hell no. That's a horrible thought. Makes me cringe. 

How does this work? Any input? Opinions? Feedback?"
"Hello, wonderful people. For 2 weeks, I've been dealing with loneliness, and self-harm. I came very close to taking my own life last week Tuesday.

Every day, I feel like every person on this earth is programmed to hate me in some way, and I'm starting to feel less human every day, because if I'm truly human, why am I still friendless and single? 

I'm posting here on Reddit because I have nowhere else to go. This sub is the only place where I feel comfortable talking about my feelings.

In regards to friendship, I wish I could experience what it's like to be part of a group where I'm not the black sheep and I'm welcomed with open arms, but sadly, I've been rejected for as long as I've lived. I was always excluded by others for no reason, and when I did have friends, they were always bad influences with hidden agendas and two faces.

In regards to relationships though, I wish I could wake up every morning, knowing that I have a special person who loves me and accepts me for who I am, someone who could say the most loving things to me that I would never hear from anyone else. I wish I could experience a warm cuddle after all that I've been put through in the past.

I feel alone just talking about those things. I wish I could be understood, accepted, and cared for. I feel like crying by just typing this. I've made diary entries and even wrote poetry about my need for human connection.

I hope you all understand, thank you for reading.❤️

"For the past few weeks, I’ve been dealing with strange new symptoms that occur and peak every night and it’s been disrupting my life. I was hospitalized on the first night this begun. These symptoms have been unbearable. 

I won’t get to see a neurologist till next month and I have limited medication that I’m trying to ration at this point to slow down the peak of these symptoms and to avoid having to return back to the hospital.

I just want someone who can listen and I am struggling hard coping with this and I have another month. I don’t have many people to lean on and I just finally got myself in counseling to deal with this.

It’s been overwhelming dealing with all this. Thank you for listening and understanding.

"Im happy to talk to anybody about anything for however long im needed. Im dyslexic so typing is difficult for me. I have discord and google meets.

I made a post before and i loved speaking with people but id guess nobodys gonna scrol low enough to see it anymore  so im making another."
Im scared i wont ever find someone who love me the same amount that I love them. Ive only been in one relationship and it was incredibly toxic he would constantly make me feel like crap about myself and was cheating on me the whole time. People say that you should tell someone how you feel to get it off your chest and every time i’ve told someone i like them it ends up shitty. Which makes me lose hope for finding someone who likes me back. It doesnt help that i dont go out a lot and have horrible conversation skills because i cant read people. I dont know what to do its not like i can meet new people from school because mine is so small i already know everyone any tips? I wanna meet more people but idk how 
"Not sure if this is the right place to post this but here we go.

I have a really hard time talking about my problems, especially when they involve other people I care about. I always feel like I shouldn't talk about people close to me in a negative light or say anything that is even semi-personal. Every time I get close to doing it, I feel like I'm a horrible person. Even with close friends. My family has a lot of issues, but I still love them a lot. Every time I have a problem with them, I feel like I have no one to talk to because I don't want to make them seem bad to people. 

My brother recently said I would be a shy person if I ever went around telling anyone about a medical diagnosis he has, and he acted like I would just go around saying, ""Yeah, that's my (medical condition) brother,"" to everyone I meet. I mean, I mentioned it maybe a few times to my friends, which I felt crappy about afterwards, but I don't do that, and it sort of made me feel disgusted with myself that he felt I would do that and make it like it's his whole personality during the same conversation. I think he told me he didn't agree with the diagnosis. I mean, I understand it wasn't the most official one, but it is on his record, and now that I know that, I won't say anything about it again. I know this is a bit off topic, but it made me feel a bit off that he basically considered the condition an insult and compared it to telling everyone that I was his gay sibling.
 
I feel like my emotions have just been boiling up, and I don't know what to do. I know I should get a therapist, but my family has a lot on their plate right now, and I feel like it would be an inconvenience.

Anyway, sorry for the rant, and thank you for your time. To whomever reads this, and sorry for the grammar."
"I’m currently a 4th year medical student, down to my last two months in clerkship. However, for this month, I’m required to spend a lot of time with the whole group instead of a subgroup and I feel left out.

There’s this one groupmate of mine, A, who apparently has a big grudge on me after apparently getting fed up with me after we had a small fight. We used to be the closest in the group. A little info about A is that they’re really sensitive, like they wouldn’t talk to you for half a day if you ate with someone without inviting them, or walking out after getting annoyed when bickering with friends. 

So I haven’t been in good terms with A since that fight about 8 months ago. I tried to make up but they ignored my efforts so I decided not to mend this relationship. Anyway, I couldn’t really avoid them since we’re in the same group and I try not interact with them. They’re more extroverted? or louder than me so I tend to keep quiet when they’re engaged with a conversation with some of the members of my group. 

Back to the recent events, we’ve been having more moments together since we have to travel to places in one van. I have this other close? friend? (B) but since they’re immediately after A in the class list, they also interact more. Most of the time recently, B chooses to interact with A more than me. B claims they can’t really pick a side since they’re friends with A and I understand but it hurts when B chooses to exclude me in some moments.

Now I feel like my group (with 9 other people) is excluding me since they’re all quite close to A. I get comments like “Go sit in the back of the van [alone]” or no one would sit with me and they’d rather sit in a cramped space. 

What triggered me was when my groupmates started re-sharing A’s IG story where A purposely cut me off of the group picture. They even had me blocked so I wouldn’t see but I managed to see it using a different account and luckily one of my groupmates had a public profile. 

I don’t recall doing anything bad to my other groupmates and to be honest, I also don’t remember doing anything grave to A to the point that they’d be so petty as to cut me off in a picture. I’m having a hard time finding ways to cope and I wanted to post here before I schedule for therapy since it’s really taking a toll on my mental health.

I still have 2 months left and I don’t have another choice but to fake that I’m okay with what’s happening but I realized I’ve been keeping it in for 8 months and I don’t know if I can still handle 2 more months without breaking. I will go to therapy though, but I still haven’t gotten a schedule yet so I wanted to ask for advice here before I feel worse."
"i have no future i can path out myself, i need to talk to someone capable of going off with me not fighting or arguing semantics, help me talk myself upward, i cannot function alone, talk to me about anything openly."
"There's something pretty terrible I'm dealing with. I'm looking for someone non-judgemental to talk to. I don't need advice, just some company for a while today.
I don't have anyone to talk to.

Please only message me if you actually want to have a conversation. It happens quite a lot lately that people message me but ghost like 5 messages in. 

I'm only comfortable talking to people over 25.

"To just break down and put down the armor. To be seen and heard in all my pain and grief. Without judgement or expectations.

Been seeing a guy that i like for 4x. He doesn't feel the same about me. I cried a lot but i need to move on. Went on online dating again, clicked well with someone only to find he blocked me the next day. Due to my profession I cannot opposite gender people who are around my age. Due to me not being in my home country I cannot just resign so easily cos this affects my living permit here. Then i realized the reason why i'm so obsessed with my dating life is I don't have any other goals to work on. Lost 14kg from last year til now. Still good with saving money towards buying a house, but now I feel stuck.

"I'm going to try and talk to my therapist about these bigger things &amp; diagnosis. I will do my best to seek help. I feel like trauma has made me so destructive.

I just feel stuck, with some relationship stuff. So many times we fight and I get triggered and it's really awful for everyone. We're on break but I can't stop feeling insecure, that I was never loved, or that the longer I wait, the more likely that they'll leave me.

The feeling of obsession, wanting to fix everything, right now, right now, only to realize you're overwhelming the other person. Making them feel as terrible as you felt.

I know a lot of people will say it's simple and I should break up. I can't say you're wrong, but I'm stubborn. I just want someone to talk to and reflect on these things. I'm having a hard time and I want to grieve. I want to be comforted and grieved.

The negative possibilities, I know them well enough.

I want to focus on myself and be happy, but it's hard when i can't get rid of him from my mind. I think I am doubly suffering my trauma right now and that is something I need to grieve on my own."

"I am having a really hard time moving on from my ex, it hurts really bad, here’s the details:

She was my first girlfriend, we lasted about a year. I (male) was 24 and she was 23 when we began dating. We are very similar. She used to say we were 2 sides of the same coin. We had similar personalities, values, interests, hobbies,struggles, insecurities and etc. I never knew someone like her could exist. I love her so much. She means so much to me. I’ve never felt so loved and accepted. She was so incredibly special. She also loved me very strongly and wanted to marry me.

Anyway, I screwed up and caused the end. There were many flaws I didn’t really know I had because I wasn’t ever in a relationship before. The first half was pretty good but halfway through I had an emotional crisis and became complacent. Basically I would say things that hurt her unintentionally and at times it would confuse me, and at other times I knew better. I do think there may have been a personality difference aswell but I think it’s totally workable. And I think I could have been more considerate. I also shared some things that should not be shared. I basically made all these really dumb and avoidable mistakes. I feel like an idiot for screwing up so royally with someone so amazing. She lost trust in me and explained it as a thousand paper cuts. I take responsibility for all my wrong. It was me and I hate what I’ve done. I totally get why it ended logically and I have changed through the heartbreak.

So…..

It’s been the most painful experience in my life. I have never cried so hard in my life. I’ll admit I idealize her alot because a big part of me is convinced she is almost perfect. She literally doesn’t really have many flaws. She’s just wonderful. So that makes it extra hard to move on. It’s been about 4 months since the breakup. She has moved on but I am still in alot of pain. And seeing her move on does hurt a lot. It makes me feel like I don’t mean anything to her or I wasn’t special enough but I know that’s not completely true, it’s just my emotions. But it still hurts really bad.

Here are some specific  moving on struggles I have:


Her~ who she is. She is incredibly unique. I have never met anyone like her. When I say we matched, we really matched. And she was the only person who has seen me fully and loved me fully. She’s the only human I could be my true full self around and feel secure and safe. I’ve always felt alone growing up, I always felt different, never fit in to any groups really. Like I love science, the outdoors, theology, video games, most genres of music, movies and more. I just feel like I don’t fit into a group and neither did she. and not only on this surface level stuff but on deeper levels too. So I felt like I found a twin flame or a soul mate, it blew my mind.

 Also something very special. There were some things that were very specific that she shared with me from her past that was so important for me in the relationship. It made me feel loved and accepted, understood. Like I don’t know how I would find someone like that again. And it’s very important to me:

EXAMPLE ( we’re Christians, but we both were atheist/agnostic at a certain point in our life and it really helps to discuss confusions and doubts from her perspective. She grounded me in a way I couldn’t. I never had this with anyone else and i can’t express how important it is to me, almost a need. Just to have someone who understands and has the same way of thinking is gold.
Also we both had pretty bad porn addictions in the past and having someone who gets that struggle means the world to me. I feel accepted and that person understands me and I get them. I feel like if I was with a person who didn’t struggle with porn and didn’t have an agnostic/atheist past I would feel scared to share my feelings and be my true self out of fear of them not understanding. I feel like it would be hard to get emotional fulfillment and understanding. So this is very important to me. But how the heck would I find someone like this again? How possible is it? It makes me so sad and scared.

Physical~ This is a weird one, but it actually hurts a lot. I wish it didn’t but it does. So… everything about her physically I love and i think she is so beautiful. Down to the most minute details. From her leg shape, her skin tone, her hair, her face shape, nose, lips, her waist, etc. it’s just her look which is overwhelmingly attractive to me. It’s like she has the perfect physique and face to me. She has a very unique look too. She is mixed so she looks very unique and is so gosh darn beautiful in every way. I don’t know how to be with anyone else without comparing them to her. Like when I see other attractive woman in public I automatically compare them to her and they are no match in any way. It’s just her look, she is crazy beautiful and hot. It actually hurts very deep. I know it’s just looks and shouldn’t matter this much but it’s hurting me and preventing me from moving on.


That’s what’s on my heart right now, so what do I do about this? Can someone else really fulfill me like her? And is there anyone out there like that? It just hurts really bad right now.

"The past few years have been one big mistake of mental health management for me.

Burnout in university -&gt; Pandemic -&gt; Mother's health issues.

It just feels like every time I would go and seek help or at least find something... something else comes along and punches me in the gut and knocks me back down.

My mother's in a bad way right now, it's in the air if she's even gonna be around soon.

I know in principle the steps I need to take, so I'm not really asking for like.. practical mental health advice or like employment advice or anything. I just, need to believe I can climb out of this hole come what may, that there is a universe where I'm not just on the side of the road. That even with this past 6 years of hell... I can start over, that I can overcome, that the journey is startable and that I won't be wasting my time or energy on a fruitless endeavour, that it's not too late or that I haven't permanently destroyed my chances of being okay.

I'm only 28... It's not all over for me... is it?"

"I just had an argument with my brother, as much as I want to complain about how stubborn he is, I lost the argument completely. He was able to state his point very clearly, backed by clear logical reasoning, and I got completely destroyed, especially since I began calling names. 

The fact I couldn’t argue with most people is really frustrating, logic was never my strong point, hell I don’t even know what my strong point is. I was raised to follow instructions, to follow orders, never question anything the adult says, or I’d be punished (raised by my dad side, while my brother is raised by my mom).

The funny thing is, I’m not even a good little soldier, as I really don’t like being told what to do. I’m a living oxymoron, I have the desire to use logic and yet never being able to, wanted to make my own decisions and yet unable to live without following orders. 

I’m parked at the side of a mountain road right now, contemplating how much of a mediocre human being I am. My dad used to looked down on me, I finally understood why, I am just mediocre. Same with how none of friends were able to come up with anything remarkable about me, besides the typical “you are a good person”, which is funny because I am highly immoral.


Sorry about the long post, I just want to get this out of my chest, I am just exhausted at life in general at this point."
"I quit my job with nothing lined up today.  After a couple meetings with my boss about it, I started to dissociate/depersonalize.  And that was fine, just felt like some well-needed distance from my thoughts.  

But then I started to wonder whether that was the real reality and I'd been living in a lie the whole time.  The issue is I have a psychology degree, and I know a lot about psychosis, and I think that actually makes me even more prone to psychosis because I understand how flawed our perceptions are and the scary fact that many with schizophrenia don't even know they have it, feeling like they're perfectly fine.  (So what if I've been schizophrenic this whole time and just now gained some insight?)

So I started by looking for imperfections.  Peeling paint.  Poorly joined drywall.  Whatever in my office I could find that looked wrong because a dream probably wouldn't be detailed enough for that.  But then I realized that if I've been living in a dream this whole time, I might now know what a *real* dream looks like because what I think are dreams are actually dreams within dreams. 

So I went to the break room and slit my wrists with one of the knives in there because I needed to make sure I'd bleed and feel pain.  Then I went back to the office and smeared the blood on one of the posters, wanting to create something super imperfect to prove to myself I wasn't dreaming. 

The pain combined with the now flawed object have helped, but I'm still feeling some of the dissociation, and I'll never be able to be 100% sure.  And I'll have to take down that poster before anyone finds it (still have to do a 30 day notice to remain eligible for rehire), but I need it to stay sane.  It's like in *Inception* where they always carry an object with them into each dream that shows them whether it's a dream or reality because it spins infinitely in dreams but stops eventually in the real world.

My bloody poster is that, and I need it. "

the future is scary. it is very uncertain and i don’t like it. i’m worried all my work in college will not bear fruit. i’m taking a huge risk following a major which generally doesn’t make a good living. but i have a plan to follow my major and make a living from it. but i’m worried it won’t work and i’m stranded. i have these dreams of grandeur but i’m scared it won’t work. oh well."
"I’m not a problem solver sadly but I want to be an ear to your problems,I’m someone who understands or can relate to a lot of experiences.

I wanna hear how you’re doing, how you’re nights going, what your mind is thinking about, are you depressed or thinking deep thoughts I wanna know lay it on me! :)

Over 18 only please"
I'm a 27 year old guy. I've had I guess a stranger life than most people. I feel like I have spent so much time alone in my life that I have fallen out of touch with reality. I don't really act the way people of my generation act. Sometimes I wonder if this world is even real.    I don't know how to explain it. I wanted to bring something beautiful into this world and instead I've brought a lot of ugliness.
"If you're feeling like you want someone to talk to or just want someone to lend an ear. Feel free to reach out and I'll do my best to help any way that I can. Even if you don't have anything pressing to talk about I'd like to hear it. 

Wishing you all the best"
"i was told to post here from another place, i hope thats ok

*nsfw for mention of self harm

for the past four years ive been in an awful situation with my family. ive had several traumatic experiences surrounding my emotionally abusive parents; they have no emotional maturity, theyre transphobic, theyre very controlling and try to micromanage many parts of my life. adding onto that, if i moved out without their blessing and separate myself from them going no contact, theyll take away all the financial resources i get from them. its really hard for me to work because of several mental health conditions including ptsd and ocd. ive been struggling for years and at some points have gotten suicidal. ive tried several times to move out through resources such as online roommate sites and good friends, but it consistently fell through and i havent been able to get anywhere. for the past year or so, ive felt at the end of the road and have had no idea where to go for help. my partner and i have tried every resource we can think of without much success. i would really appreciate any advice on where to go from here"
"Hey everyone. I would like to open up a bit on here. Since March of last year, I've had many instances where I felt extremely lonely, I would constantly lay in bed for hours, and even cry. From September to October, I went through, so far, the worst case of loneliness. I would h**m myself, continue to lay in bed for long periods of time, and fantasize about being given a hug.

At that point, I didn't want to be in a romantic relationship, I just wanted a close friend, someone who would accept me and understand me. I was hurting and I just wished that someone was there.

Last weekend, I went through another emotional breakdown, because I felt like I was hated by everyone, from the things on Reddit that are said to me, to the hurt I endured in the past. 

Any kind words would mean so much to me. Thank you for reading."

"Hello guys, I live in a hostel and I had my cup in my room. This cups is like a souvenir from my first job. it was very close to my heart. I came back from a visit to my home for a week and now I have lost my cup. Someone broke into my room and stole my cup. I am bawling my eyes out right now I feel like its childish but it hurts soo much....."

"Im 24 a student worker with a pretty shitty day to day life. Im having exams right now and i have been feeling particularly bad.I have no free time and i cant relax even if my life depends on it.Feeling sad, hopeless, sick...i dont know.Would anyone be kind enough to hear me complain?"
"I'm devastated, this morning I woke up with so much anxiety and hopelessness. We have discussed that having long distance isn't the best thing to do as we have been in a long distance relationship for the last 1 year while he was away and it was so hard for both of us, especially due to the time difference. The last one month I got to spend with him was beautiful, it reminded me of all the reasons I want to be with him. We've been together for 6 years now. The most rational decision is to break up and move on as I don't have any feasible plans to move to the country even if I want to (due to a lot of factors), and he will be spending a decent number of years, and might even have to settle there. I know that instead of dragging it out and hurting each other, we can part on good terms but even thinking about it makes me so heartbroken."
"a close person shouts at you (depending on who is the person) and you start crying really hard, moreover, if it's not only because of the shouting so you also felt a wild experience (for example another fear) and you were also shouted at, that's it, the next few days are killed. After that, a nervous condition and then if you think it over and realise that there is nothing to cry about, but still at least some detail related to it and you start crying again. I've already thought about it so much, tried to control it (it didn't work), and then recently again and all your efforts went down the drain. I also want to add that I felt a slight guilt (and I was yelled at for that) I'm not very confident and I needed support (so I was yelled at, because of that too, well, you could say I was offended but also told the truth lol) combo. . I just have social problems I need support and here I get this, although in that situation there is not very social but still.

I just want to ask how to solve that. I want control my emotions, crying (its the most dificult) and I dunno how. When I wanted then to talk about that with someone or just to to think about that, I couldn't ( I cried and its so dificult) I read a lot arcticles but I ddnt find the appopriate solution...

P.s I apologise for the pun. Im not native in English so im sorry. And I know it isnt such a big problem for someone

"I'm not even sure if this is gonna help, but I'm at my wit's end and wanted to try something. 

I thought I was recovering but today crept up on me. My eyes are sore and tired, spent at least a third of my day crying. I've felt despondent for the last few hours with my eyes still burning and I can't sleep.

Hmu if you'd be able to call on discord."
"Over the past year my life has been unraveling. My wife left me for the woman she was having an affair with, after coming out. We have two toddlers that we share 50/50 custody and coparent well with eachother. But our daughter was having severe enough health problems that I lost my job because I needed so much time off to care for her. Then I lost my phone plan and my duplex because I just can't find work around me. It's felt like the harder I try, the faster life falls apart around me. 

Now I've started to feel such a severe loneliness that I've never experienced before. I've always been okay with being alone, but lately things have felt different. Idk if it's because I really loved being married, having someone who I finally felt loved me and who I loved back? I got so used to the feeling of having someone else's touch. Not in a weird way, just the sense of security that comes with the feeling of someone else's touch. I've never really had the feeling of being secure from a loved one before (I'm a 35yo male). So being betrayed by the first person I felt that from has made me almost feel like it just isn't something I'm meant to have. 

Lately I've started having such vivid dreams of this one person. Her name is different every time but her face is always the same. But the dreams are so vivid that I can feel her hand when I hold it, I can feel her body when I hug her. And no, nothing sexual ever happens lol. She just holds my hand or hugs me and I feel that sense of warmth and security that I've always wanted and wished for and thought I had. I wake up every time after she says this one simple particular phrase ""it's going to be okay"". But I wake up feeling so lonely that it feels like it's in my bones. Idk what to do or how to go about fixing my life...I've been on at least 12 interviews, after submitting hundreds of applications, and none have panned out. Plus I'm developing severe agoraphobia and I just....idk.."
"I thought I found a best friend three days ago, but turns out I got blocked. I'm crying right now as I'm typing this. I literally posted all this depression stuff, and I finally got what I wanted but then things went down south. I fucking don't want to kill myself, but I feel like I'm this close, because I have no friends. No one invites me to anything, no one responds to me. I have a broken family and broken heart. I really just want a girl, to really just calm me down, offer to be besties and we treat it like a true friendship like any other like IRL besties but on online side ofc, like sharing snaps and happy things. I just want someone. Or, my life is over tonight."

"I sustained a severe traumatic brain injury more than 4.5 years ago. Before, I had severe depression and self hatred and it’s definitely changed a lot since my injury. It’s gotten way way worse. Like a lot of the time (especially when I’m alone and have time to think) it’s pure agony to live with this mind. And I’m mostly too scared to open up and get help, so I honestly rely on music a lot for coping and therapy. Here are 6 of the songs that have lyrics that I really relate to:

&amp;nbsp;

**Die Another Day by Blind Channel ft. RØRY**

“Running out of rage
Running out of reasons
Running out of hate
Running out of demons
Running out of pain and
I need a meaning to make me whole again” - I just relate so hard to this verse

**Enemy by Designer Disguise**

“Wanna get better and thrive
Need to get out of my mind
I wanna live not survive” - These few lines hit so hard for me, as I want so bad to feel better and be happy. Especially the last line hits especially hard, I want to stop feeling like every day is hell and struggle to be happy, and just want to live normally like other people

**Black Hole Brain by Citizen Soldier**

“I'm not ready to remember
I'm afraid of therapy
Every thought's a hair-pin trigger
I'm avoiding careful"" - I relate so so hard to this lyric because I’m honestly really afraid of therapy. I just don’t want to open up or anything to anyone, idk.

**ICU by Citizen Soldier**

“You’ve been hurting in a million ways
No one else can see
Cause no one took ‘em serious
‘Til the injuries” - I was hurting so bad before my injury, and it feels like I (and all my problems) only matter now, after my injury

…

“I see you trying not to cry
Just wishing you had not survived” - There’s definitely been more than one instance where I’ve been at this point

**If I Surrender by Citizen Soldier**

“There’s no agony like being strong when no one knows you’re sick” - This line honestly physically hurt to listen to the first few times I listened to it, because cause this line is exactly exactly how I feel. Every day, I act strong and happy all the time because I don’t want to hurt them or make them worry. Hell, my dad was even talking to my neuropsychologist a few weeks ago and apparently he told her that I’m the happiest person he’s ever seen in response to her mentioning how I had depression (this wasn’t a breach of privacy or anything, I asked her to talk to my parents about this). And I don’t blame him at all for thinking this, I try really hard to make sure people around me think I’m all right and not worry about me.

**Anymore by Lø Spirit**

“[After saying “I can’t do this anymore”]
Wait.. yes I can
Gotta “be a man”
Gotta hide the hurt, cause what’s worse? Losing me or them?” - god this lyric also hit so hard. I feel like I gotta force myself to be happy and everything otherwise everyone’s gonna just leave me. Like I’m not good enough for them. I relate really hard to the rest of the song too, because I honestly don’t know how I keep going on day by day.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m not even sure why I’m posting this, I guess I’m just hoping for some kind words to help me. As I mentioned, I can’t/won’t open up to anyone in real life (I’m too scared to open up and hurt them or bother them), so I’d really appreciate some kind words here."
I usually write longer posts but I'll keep this one simple. If you don't have anyone you can talk to then feel free to reach out. I also have discord with the same username if you prefer that. Text chat only. You don't need to feel invisible or uncared for.
"Someone who I can play PlayStation with, and especially someone who will care about me and text me daily, and even call? And preferably in a USA time zone central or eastern? That way we can text more without more problems, I want someone I can talk to and just call with, I like red dead redemption two, and video games, I work often very often and I like to bike, if you wanna be friends let me know !"
"I don't really have much family I can talk to, and I can't open up to my friends about it either so I'm hoping someone could just listen for some time or maybe help push me to ask help from what little support system I dohave"
"Before I start, I'm sorry if it's a bit of a mess of thoughts and feelings. Basically: 2 weeks ago, 2 of my closest friends (who are dating each other) cut contact with our friend group over some pretty dumb stuff. One girl, who I've been close with for a few years now, is luckily super supportive for me in all of this. But what she doesn't know is that I caught feelings for her a few months ago. It's not the first time I have feelings for her, so I'm honestly mad at myself for having those feelings again. I really want to tell her but I know I'll get rejected, and after losing 2 friends recently I don't think I'm ready to be rejected. Knowing her and how she reacted last time I had feelings for her, she won't mind and it won't break the friendship, I'm just not ready for rejection yet. 

All of this just makes me feel so lonely. I crave to be held and cuddled. I'm 20, never dated, never kissed or even held hands with anyone. It hurts so much, and the one person I could talk to about stuff like that... Is my crush, which would be awkward with the whole feelings thing. So I practically can't talk about it."
"This is pretty fricked situation. My ex broke up with me 5 weeks ago after 2 years, I tried to beg for her back in the first couple days but then stopped and left her be. I then found out she slept with someone else after she text me asking if I was okay which led into a natural conversation, which it was then mentioned. I didn’t get angry just felt numb and told her “okay probably best if we don’t speak again”. However, we then met cause we hadn’t spoken about anything to do with the breakup. You can guess what happened next, we slept together. That was it then we said not again bye. I blocked her on everything and then she no caller ID rang me a couple times so I answered and said “is there something really wrong.” She said she wanted to ask me something, in which she said why don’t you come down here. I was hesitant but eventually said okay. She said she doesn’t know what’s wrong and why she feels sad…. We then slept together again. 1 day went passed and we went to get food and then slept with each other again. But she had also been sleeping with this other guy 3 different times. Honestly, I was very sad that we broke up but now I’m not. I just want to see a different perspective to what I see."
"I'm listening to a song that reminds me of her and crying in the dark it's the worst feeling 


the side I'm seeing is painful, I hope her side, the one I can't see, is peaceful and full of happiness 



the song is [I miss you](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Y6_Mfx5DgvE) by hannah montana 

I know it's a stupid low budget show 

but it reminds me of my childhood 

and that song specifically reminds me of her 


if anyone cares can you please listen to the song with me so I don't feel alone"

"My girlfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years now.  Hell, I just bought a ring.  And there are so many moments where I can feel the love for her so intensely…. But most of the time I’m fighting myself and my flight response.  I can’t tell if it’s a true feeling to myself or if it’s simply my brain being an asshole with its established baseline..  

I’ve found desire changing, preference changing, habits, thoughts, etc.  this relationship has helped me so much,  we’ve healed each other from so many things, and we have an amicable time with each other.

Just don’t know what to do."
"Hello

This post might be a bit long but I would truly appreciate it if someone would comment. I usually get ghosted some I'm hoping that's not the situation here. Thank you! Really sorry for the long post but I have to get this off my mind somehow.

**What Happened:**Honestly not even sure what to say. I'm just feeling really lonely and lost right now. I'm a student going to university and I feel like I'm a fraud doing my degree sometimes because the professors aren't the best in my department so I feel like I'm learning nothing. Having this feeling makes me scared to apply for jobs. I'm afraid I won't land a job before graduation and I really don't want to be sitting around post-grad with nothing waiting on interviews.

On top of that a few months ago I had a pretty big argument with one of my closest friends. So not really being friends with him or his brother anymore is striking me. We have a pretty big circle of friends but I was truly the closest to him but I feel kinda betrayed after what happened. We were so close that I would give free rides to him whenever we both needed to be at the same place so I think it hit me really hard. I was really close to their family and thought of them as my own. I bought him an iPad for his graduation recently. I loved being his friend. Usually, I don't struggle with emotion like this but it's made me more depressed than it should have.

Both of these guys had always had a tendency to listen to everything their dad said which did bother me at times but I usually understood it considering their situation. Whenever we wanted to eat out they were picky, if we wanted to do something they had to confirm with their dad, as an example him being 21 and having his Nintendo taken away because he was playing too many games was a bit weird but again I didn't think much of it. We always played Fortnite during the summer pretty much all day so I can see how it was annoying that he wasn't actually doing something useful regardless of if he had graduated.

To quickly give some context, over the summer we had a plan for one weekend, 10 people were coming to my house for a party and the next day we would go to the movies. Only 3 people came to my place which made me upset. My closest friend wasn't able to come because his dad sent him on a trip which I understood at first but I was hoping his brother would come considering he was in town. I asked him the night before and he said I can't because ""my dad said so"". Obviously, since I was notably upset I was ghosting everyone. and after he said ""My dad said so"" I just left him on read.The next day he called me an hour before the movie and I ghosted him. I felt like his brother was only calling around that time because he was looking for a free ride. At the movies, he got a ride from his dad. We didn't say anything to me and I didn't say anything back. I was lowkey expecting an apology but I wasn't shocked because my friend's brother never apologized. Sometimes even in dire situations when it's been his fault I've never seen him apologize.

My friend while on the trip would message me asking for forgiveness and I wasn't so easy on him this time because he's done this before. Either he doesn't like to come or his family gets in his way so I was a little hesitant about wanting to forgive. Without going into too much detail we said some things to each other. Despite still being annoyed at him we sort of left it with me saying ""I will forgive but not forget"". Things were still heated. I said to him how I was pissed at his brother and that he was ""cocky/prideful"" which I think he got pretty upset at. He did mention his dad in the conversation we had a few times. He messaged saying he would talk to his brother when he came back.

The day he came back I approached him and he was really mad at me. He said his brother is mad at me because ""I left him on read and didn't answer his call"". I was really confused and annoyed as to how I was suddenly the guy in the wrong when I had a right to be upset at how the situation turned out for me. I invite my friends to my house and nobody shows up, apparently, it's not a big deal so how dare you get mad. Also, I had told my friend 2 weeks before everyone else about the party/movie but he didn't tell his family so he and his brother couldn't come because their dad didn't know about it in advance. It was his fault clearly. The entire mess was my friend's fault but because of him his brother and I were on bad terms.

Regardless I decided to drop it and apologize the same night. The only reply I get is ""It's ok, I have to go"" followed by in front of me both leaving with some of our other friends. Felt so pathetic in that moment, I felt like I had no self-worth. I'm not even worth enough to be listened to. The guy that you made upset is coming himself to apologize but still, that isn't enough.

I give them space but message over text to emphasize that I truly was apologetic. The same thing, ""It's ok"". A few days later I show up but they immediately leave. I apologized to their dad after running into him thinking that maybe I upset him because that's the impression I was left with. He told me ""It's ok but we should watch what we say"". I got the impression that he was mad at me. That day was so rough, I went home and shed a few tears cause I was really mad at how everything was turning out. I left a voice message apologizing again. Both said, ""It's ok, we're sorry too, time will tell"". This was August..

I've seen both of them in person a few times at different events but we haven't really spoken to each other. We just uttered a few words and that's pretty much it. I don't really mind not being friends with them anymore. The month of September was a bit annoying to get through because I stopped showing up wherever they were so being alone was tough. I did a lot of things with these guys. My family helped me get through it, I spent a lot of time with my brothers playing video games or going out with family. It was nice but since the days are shorter now and school has been going on for some time now it's been a little overwhelming because it feels like you're all alone. During this time I like to rely on friends but since I'm not really close to a friend like that anymore and because of this situation I've been a little stressed out.

**How I'm Feeling:**I've always felt weird around his brother. It might even be a little bit of jealousy. I've always felt pathetic around him because he's jacked while I'm not. He seemed perfect in every way and everyone preferred him whenever we would play ball or something else. It got in my head but since we were friends I didn't care too much. In fact, I don't even like hanging around with any of our circle because everyone has their own mini-groups. A lot of them are also really toxic and competitive which isn't in my nature, the only reason why I was playing around with these people is because we all live in the same neighborhood so we see each other all the time and my closest friend was a little quiet like me so I enjoyed his company. I didn't mind being around everyone as long as he was there. It was so obvious that people were shocked and poked at how I only came if he came. During this period of time that I've been struggling with this, I've been going through many emotions.

At first, it was a little hard but after practically begging them to forgive me hoping that it would be the same I realized that I had to stop and have some self-respect. My goal was to never cut ties or anything but to realize how I was being a little misused in our friendship. I feel okay but every now and then I have these annoyances of constantly thinking about what happened, if it was my fault or their fault, or if things could have been different. I don't want to think about it anymore. A few weeks after what happened I remember that I was so disturbed by this with the feeling of betrayal that whenever I did something wrong I remembered ""did ""brother's name"" do this?"". He's so perfect that I have to be like him. This sounds weird but it's like he's controlling everything I do, I had to be better than him so every single thing I did was because of him. Every time I've thought about this or felt pathetic about how I begged someone without self-respect to forgive me and was treated like a dog my mom has helped me but I can't keep going back to her. It must get annoying.

I was doing fine for so long but it's just that recently I started to remember all of it again. The stress of school which is normal for a student has made this entire feeling a bit more overwhelming. I feel lonely and it seems tough to get through it. I think what triggered these thoughts is playing the new season of Fortnite. It has made me remember many of our good memories from when we played the game earlier in the year. We used to play a lot with each other, just recently I logged on and saw that he had unfriended me from the game which hurt a lot for some reason. You know we texted a lot, just brothers living life doing stuff together having fun so getting the blame for something that isn't really my fault hurts. I don't know why I keep remembering what happened and I want to get it out of my head. I've tried so many things and watched so many videos that talk about how friendships come and go. I just wish I was able to explain what my situation was or maybe if he understood it. I was so mad that I went on a rampage deleting all pics I had of them on my phone regardless of what it was from. I still have the messages from all my apologies but I'm thinking of deleting those too now.

Thinking about constantly is not letting me focus on school, I haven't really been eating too much, and haven't been hitting the gym like I've wanted to. It's sort of dragging me down. I can't truly avoid them either because our group of friends is quite large so I'm bound to run into them some time and I feel like when I see either one of them it'll make me mad or think about it more. I find myself struggling the most at night, it's easy when you're busy but when you aren't my mind runs back there fast. If I'm outside at a public place I'm always looking around to see if they are there. When I do something I like I think about if they liked it.

I need help man, I wanna forget and move on. I don't know what's going on with me but I feel betrayed. I feel like my mind is running around right now because these people was really close to me. I'm not even mad at what happened anymore, if they wanna distance themselves they can. I gave a lot of my friendship to em and I didn't get enough of it back. I have other friends but for some reason, I'm finding myself feeling guilty hanging out with them. I'm not sure why. I feel like they'll also betray me. It's so bad sometimes that if I message someone and they don't reply to me or leave me on read I immediately start getting negative thoughts about that person.

Sometimes I start questioning myself and how maybe I was the toxic friend. I can see how I was aggressive sometimes and was aggressive over what happened but I didn't think it needed to get this bad. I didn't want to lose my friend. I can't reach out to them either because my parents advised me not to do so. I also want to listen to their advice. If I apologized to his parents he should have done the same to mine because my parents were also reasonably upset with how he handled the situation and treated me. I'm not even sure if I'm mad at them, disappointed, or if I want to seek revenge. I feel like the feeling of hatred comes and goes. To be honest I don't even want to live in the area I'm living in anymore and plan on moving after I get a job.

I keep thinking about the summer, even though it's far away. I don't have much to do in the summer so I feel like I have to go out and play sports if everyone else is and if they're there I feel like I can't because the same thing might happen. That's why I want to grab a job before graduating so I'm busy with my own life and don't have to deal with people but that seems impossible.Just a lot going on right now and I don't know man, I just don't wanna be depressed. I feel like I even missed some of the stuff I wanted to mention here. 

I've always felt lonely, and never truly had a friend expect him. We became closer around 2018 and though I understand that friends come and go it's hard to make the mind understand that. You remember the good memories but then immediately remember the bad memories. Even though we're all on good terms now and have seen each other a few times with minimal conversation I still feel as if they're mad at me. Especially after seeing that he unfriended me on that stupid game, I feel like he still hates me. I know that it probably isn't the case and I want to think good about others but my mind keeps going back to the negativity in all of this. I'm scared that if I show up to an event they'll leave because of me which is something I don't want to face again. I find it funny how I think like this now when truly I watch and do many things differently from them. I haven’t been able to enjoy the football season like I’ve wanted to because of my thoughts. That’s something they don’t like. Or watch any of the shows that I’ve wanted to. Again something they don’t like. I don’t want to make it a bigger deal than it is and have our entire circle know that there is “tension” between us either. 

There’s too much going on in the world right now. Other people have bigger issues right now. I need someone to help me calm my mind down please. 

I've been as far as even considering seeing a therapist but it's a bit expensive. I want to just chat with someone personally but everyone I've tried to do that with online leaves mid-conversation. Though the post is long, I have nowhere else to really go.

Can anyone guide me through this or tell me what I should do? How can I stop thinking about this? What are some methods to block out a few thoughts? If I see them in person how can I control my thoughts and emotions? I'm honestly so lost right now, this might even sound dramatic but I've never really been through anything like this so I'm finding it a bit hard to manage my emotions. I've noticed that I am a sensitive person when it comes to my emotions. I'm a little glad that this happened because I feel like I want other people's assurance to feel good about my self. I don't have any self-confidence. To be fair now that I think about I believe that our friendship was more of a one-sided thing rather than both of us putting effort into it. I want to become a better person, I want to learn from this and move on."

I'm not doing too good right now and could really use some comfort and support.. 
"Hi!! I’m f18 from Europe, I’ve always been good at dealing with trauma but almost half year ago something happened to me and I can’t cope. I’ve tried texting about it to many people and it doesn’t help me, I’ve never spoken the story / issue out loud and would love to have someone who listens. Sadly as many victims of trauma I didn’t react properly to the situation at the time and my behaviour throughout has got me many bad and mean reactions so I would appreciate a bit of an understanding and support. 

My PMs always open, I would also appreciate maybe other victims of trauma or SA, how do you deal with the guilt of not reacting properly or wrongly in the situation?"
"My whole life, I've just been different. Call me neurodivergent, call me a loner, a loser, call me whatever; I don't think the label matters. After so many years of rejection and loneliness, it's turned me into something bitter; I'm not even going to lie about it. I'm mainly bitter against myself, but I'm also bitter against the world, and I'm bitter against ""God"", if it even exists, for putting us all through such an awful and unfair existence. But I don't want to be bitter anymore. I just want to be happy, or if not happy, at the very least content... I know, however, I can never be truly content with being alone. It's just not in my nature.

I just don't get it. I don't get the point of being happy, of pretending like the world isn't such an absolute dog shit place to be; especially for someone like me. What is the point of suffering constantly if I'm always likely going to be alone in the end? I'm always alone because I'm suffering, and it makes me insufferable to be around. The cycle just repeats endlessly... I'm trying to ditch the whole woe is me attitude, I really am. It's just hard when it's all I've ever known, how is it even possible to be happy when I'm me? I just wish I could be someone else, someone normal. Someone halfway smart and witty. Not slow and stupid.

Someone who doesn't wallow in their own misery, who lashes out against others at times when they don't see the ""cosmic fairness"" of it all... I'm just tired of being bitter. I know, I could theoretically be someone better. it's not impossible... but it's so hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel sometimes, especially when all I've ever known is darkness. In some sick, twisted kind of way, the cynical bastard in me is the only true friend I've ever had. It's the only thing that's kept me safe. I don't even know if that light exists anymore for me, honestly. It's just been so long since I've seen a glimmer of it... Well, if you read my bullshit to the end, thank you. Trust me, I know how insufferable me and my attitude can be, so I'm sorry. I just can't help but to let out a good whinge and a moan from time to time. All the best."
"This morning, I awoke to:
- the girl I went out with last week suddenly disappearing from my tinder queue after several days of not replying to me - I thought our date went well and we talked for a few days after but this is probably the third rejection I’ve had this year.
- small dumpster fire at work, which has been very stressful this entire year and yesterday something happened that made me feel like a huge screw-up. I have such a hard time dividing work/worth. It has made my adulthood pretty unbearable. I just had a convo with a good friend about work life balance, and it seems like once again I am reminded why work has such a strong hold on my well-being.

For context, I am in therapy. I didn’t really date for years while I recovered from a pretty traumatic break-up. And yes the election is a little stressful but this stuff is immediately making it hard on me. 


Anyway I don’t really want to raw dog of white knuckle this morning - I don’t have a support system which can make these things rough. I have friends to talk to sometimes but there’s no one I’m that comfortable with talking to right now."
Im ill and working from home. Would be nice to speak to someone while i work

"my boufriend of almost 2 years just broke up with me

for reference, we are both in senior year and we got togteher before the beginning of junior year

he was my everything, my entire world. I based my future off of him. he was my first boyfriend, first love, first kiss, first *everything*

i feel dirty, i promised myself i wouldnt do it untill marriage but here we are and hes left me

i feel like i tied my happiness to him which was really unhealthy and he became my main source of comfort, socializing, etc. i would get super super anxious when we didnt text for like 10 mins. in all i became extremly controlling and i regret it so much

i miss everything, esp our memories. i miss his family. i miss the little things like scratching the back of his head when we were driving, or looking at the baby clothes section in stores. i cant go anywhere wihtout thinking about him

he deleted our posts last night

i dont even know what im saying anymore

i want more than anything for him to come back, for one more chance to make sure that thiss can work out. a couple days ago he said he was 100% up for getting back togetehr, whether it be tmr or in 30 years. i know how desctructive hope is but its all i have

my heart hurts and i feel like i cant breathe

we went abroad together, did everything together, always called after dinner.

it sucks that we go to such a small school (&lt;15 ppl in our grade), where one grade is one class. hes in every class w me and his seat is next to mine, our school is going on a trip to mexico this month w my class and the year below

ive been spending all day at shcool crying to my teachers

i just want someone to hold me"
"Heya, wishing everyone a good weekend!

I'm looking for someone to VC with in telegram just to hang out and talk about light-hearted things like hobbies,art, music.
I've been playing the piano and guitar for a while so any music buddies are welcome.
I also love photography and dancing in my free time along with taking walks.

I speak English and Spanish so feel free to DM me and let me know more about you!"
" It happened while I was on my way home from the grocery store. I was walking home with the things I bought and my phone chimed. I got a message saying that someone used my account to pay something and that I should click on a link if it wasn't me. I was so panicked I immediately clicked the link. I got notified afterwards that a big sum of money got taken out of my account. 

I've been feeling so down about it lately. I know it wasn't technically my fault, it was the scammer's, but I can't help but feel like it's also my fault for falling for it....."
"I can't face another day.
I have a job.
I work from my bedroom.
I went to the best university I could possibly manage. I did great.
I found a corporate job involved environmental issues.
Almost 3 years in. I still live in a tiny cold rented room in a noisy miserable flat next to the loudest bars in a idiot town full of entitled, delusional people. 
I can't afford my own place, a car.
I couldn't find a woman I liked to date for almost 3 years.  Partly due to work and family stress, having to move back home too.
My sister tried to kill herself this year. Not the first sibling of mine to try. My brother killed himself years ago.
I sit at home.
There is no office.
I just know my walls way too well.
I go outside a lot as much as I can.
Now it's dark before i finish typing words into reports that barely matter and are far too large for the task.
I struggle to keep up with my colleagues.
I tried therapy, it was drab. The therapist gave simple, cliché advice. 

Every woman i speak to wants nothing to do with me romantically. They dump me after a few weeks at most. No spark. Not ready for a relationship. Not enough in some way. For anyone. Ever. 

I tried to do the best I could for society. I spent years studying the world's biggest environmental challenges. It was depressing but I just want to make this world less dangerous to inhabit. All I ever got in return was condescension and judgement, ""why doesn't he drive or eat meat, he thinks he's better than us"". I don't I hate me. 

I wish I was dead. I hate winter. I hate what my life has become. I need real friends,  real community,  a partner, a comfortable place to live. A job that doesn't keep me in my room all day. A secure future. A life I can't have, I did everything I could. Everything. I failed. We all failed. I'm sorry if your reading this I just needed to vent. I need help. But I haven't met anyone who can give it to me in this country."
It's been a rough and weird few months for me. The people in my life I feel like I can normally turn to have too much of their own stuff going on right now and I can't burden them. I just need to talk to someone about what's been going on.
"I have been best friends with this girl for a few years now. We are really close, working through our LGBTQIA+ journey and our friend group struggles together. She is the person in my life I trust more than anyone else, and I would take a bullet for her. She is honestly so kind and cares for anyone. I have loved her for about a year now.

Recently, she came out as finding her identity- as aroace.

I reapevt this, and so I have been trying to repress my feelings, but I can't. Every time I even look at her I feel like a bad person because she doesn't want me to love her above the deep platonic bond we have for each other. I can't tell her, we couldn't stay as it has been after.

I don't want help with telling her, I just needed to tell somebody, anybody, because this is painful. Unrequited love inevitably brings sorrow."
"This community was recommended on this post in another community. Hopefully this is OK to post here.

So this has been a regular problem my entire life and now I really need to do something about it before I screw something up. This is the first time I have become consciously aware of the situation but everytime I like someone I become scared of them. I have always brushed it off as normal because I could justify it as fear of rejection. Now I have a chance at something really great with a really close friend that has liked me for way longer than I have liked him and I feel like I'm uncomfortable putting a label on anything or even trying to get close to him physically. I'm terrified if I keep acting like this he will think I'm not as interested as I made it seem but something is causing me to panic about everything. Please help... I really care about him and really want to make this work...

Being completely honest I'm crying while writing this. Any advice would be extremely appreciated. I really don't want to scare him away."
"as the title said, i'm sick for the second time in three weeks and i feel like hot garbage, plus i'm having a chronic pain flare up . would just like some reassurance that i'm not being lazy if i literally can't do my work (and *maybe* any recipes y'all have for making someone feel better that are pretty easy to make? no pressure if you don't have one tho)"
"(F35) Some days I feel great in the morning and then I feel miserable in the evening, today is one of those days. What makes it extra hard is that I promise I’m doing all the right things to feel better but I just can’t stop the tears from coming out, I don’t understand why the pain just doesn’t become less. I’m going to therapy, working out, getting into new hobbies, distracting myself, I mean, I’m a very busy person lol, but yet… his thoughts come to me mind and I’m undone. 

It just doesn’t stop, and I’m in SO MUCH PAIN, and it gets odd to tell the same people the same story for 7 weeks lol, I need somebody, anybody, who will want to listen to my sad story, maybe put sense into my brain and remind me that everything will be ok. 

Please help me feel less miserable. 

Thanks ❤️

"Hi y'all. I'm currently in a bit of a crisis and am coming to Reddit for advice. This post is probably going to be pretty long, so thank you in advance if you decide to read it. Regardless, I'll include a TL;DR at the end. I'm also going to crosspost to multiple subs for max visibility, and because I'm not sure which sub is the most fitting for the kind of help I'm seeking.

I don't know where to start, so I'll just jump right in. I'm alone and I'm lost. I'm 27m, and I live alone with my cat in Texas. I don't have a single friend that I would consider to be a “true"" friend. I have a couple of work acquaintances and a friend who lives in Florida who l've never met, but who I talk to every day. He's extremely emotionally detached but It's nice to be able to vent to him.

My problem is that l'm a serial loner. l've gone through life with friends and relationships coming and going, either due to them leaving or my own sabotaging. In middle school I was extremely socially awkward and was bullied relentlessly. In high school I started to find myself and became very social and found my group, but those friendships withered away soon after graduation. In college my social butterfly habits continued until I became serious with a girl who l'll call Ex 1. I dated her for 2.5 years and slowly stopped talking to all of my other friends because I was so focused on her. She was my best friend, and to this day is the ""bestest"" friend I've ever had. However, our relationship was super toxic (partially due to my mental health issues and also due to me being constantly unsure if she was ""the one"") and eventually we broke up in 2019, when I was 21. After we broke up I fell into an extremely dark depression that l've never really recovered from. I've made some friends since then (a group of neighbors that moved into the apartment next to mine, a motorcycle club that I formed, etc) but those friendships were always shallow and ended up dissolving for one reason or another. In 2020 I shot myself in the torso (not a suicide attempt, I was just incredibly depressed and delusional). In 2021 | got into a motorcycle accident that almost killed me and left severe, ugly scars all over my head. From October 2021 until September 2023 | worked as a mentor for young adults with severe mental health issues (ironic, I know). I quit that job (a very unethical and shady company) shortly before it went out of business, and now I work as an Amazon driver.

Which brings me to my current state of affairs. Since 2021, most people l've met have been through Yik Yak, a message board type app marketed towards college students. I met a girl there in February, who I'll call Ex 2. Over the next few months we became super close, and soon I was putting all of my time and value into her. I was beginning to think she was my future wife. That relationship is a story in itself, but in short, in July she moved back in with her parents, 6 hours away from me. She downloaded Tinder and met a girl who quickly became my replacement. Things got ugly and we broke up about a month ago. Last week she told me she never really loved me and never wants to talk to me again, and I'm absolutely fucking devastated.

So now here I am. Another failed relationship and back to being completely alone. I'm in so much pain about this breakup, why she left me, wondering if our love was real, etc. but it's also making me realize that I myself am entirely too broken. I've always had severe OCD and EXTREME social anxiety. I've been depressed since 2019. Those are issues which I just began to address (I saw a psychiatrist for the first time on Thursday, who prescribed me Prozac, and I just enrolled myself in my job's health insurance plan, which I plan on using to have neuropsychological testing done and find a therapist), but I'm scared that won't be enough.

The reason I'm coming here for help is that I'm trying to find insight on the issues of loneliness, relationships, friendship and love. I'm just confused about it all. Specifically, I'm struggling with the idea of needing to love myself and fix my own issues before being able to make lasting connections with people. I know logically that that's what I need to do, but I feel too alone to begin the process. What's the point in finding love and happiness within myself if I can't find it within anybody else? I'm just stuck and I don't know what to do. Sometimes I have moments of energy and hope, where I tell myself that I just need to heal myself and then I'll find love, but then when it comes time to actually start that process, I feel paralyzed. I remember how Ex 2 moved away and threw our whole relationship away and fell in love with someone else (they're planning on having a baby via a fertility clinic) like it was nothing. I remember that I'm alone. I don't want to do this alone. I will say that both of my parents are in my life and they are a blessing; the only people I have. But they don't struggle with the issues I have and they don't understand. I just want to be the confident social butterfly that I was in 7-8 years ago, but I don't know how. And I'm so scared that getting too old. Everybody my age is getting married and has the friends that they'll likely keep for the rest of their lives. How do I overcome this? Most importantly, what is the true meaning of companionship and how should I go about finding it?

Thanks again to those that decided to read that heap of word salad. Any advice or insight would be much appreciated.

TL;DR: I don't know how to make lasting connections with people. I don't know how to find friends that I value, or find healthy love. I need to reframe my mind but I don't know where to start."

It feels like I have lost control of myself, I don't even understand half the times what I'm doing with my life. Little bit throughout the day, this feelings or thoughts hit me and it makes me realize like you, what are you doing right now??

And I have no clue how do I get myself together. Idk if I'm feeling analysis paralysis or am I just living in this shame, fear, insecurities zone.

"My grandma passed away yesterday.
She had another stroke,  went to hospital but after she experienced two strokes last year and had multiple other health issues it was clear to everyone we cannot and don’t want to do anything anymore. When my mother called I immediately went my hometown. My mom called me right when I went on the train.

I could still see her, but she was already gone.

My mom was with her and held her hand and sang a song to her and she just went peacefully. I am grateful that she did not have to suffer , that there is no more pain and hardship.

She couldn’t do a lot of things she enjoyed in the past 1.5 years. No cycling, no going for walks. Sometimes she didn’t even want to go to church because she said she feels embarrassed for what she now looks although church was among the most important things to her.

I am so glad I got to have her as one of my closest confidants, she was always in my side. I will miss her voice, I will miss writing post cards and kettters to her, to send her pictures of the garden, I am so sad I will never eat her soups again and her cake and get to share the beauty of nature with her.

I really want to believe so much that she will be looking over me.

Yesterday was such a beautiful day, bright light and beautiful fall colors. I passed a bike lane by the river and pictured her riding her bike and smiling and waving and being happy she could finally be as independent as she ever wanted to be.

I please need some kind words. I know she has  long life but being called her first and big one never again makes my heart aching."

"Hey everyone,

I hope it’s okay to share my story here. I’m really struggling and could use some support and advice. I was raised by a narcissistic mother in Bangladesh, and I’ve faced mental abuse from her my whole life. This has left me with low confidence, serious anxiety, and mild depression. Growing up, I didn’t socialize much, and because of my mother’s controlling nature, I missed out on learning basic life skills during my boyhood and teenage years.

Since moving to the UK, I’ve finally started to learn things like cooking, which felt like a huge step for me. But even simple tasks can be overwhelming. For example, tying my shoes can take me a long time, and I still struggle with basic self-care. One of the biggest challenges I face is my decision-making. I often make very poor choices. Like, if I need to go from point A to C and I know I should go through B, somehow I’ll end up taking a completely different path. It’s incredibly frustrating because I don’t always get to C, and it makes me feel lost.

I got married recently to my amazing wife, who is the love of my life, but I wasn’t mentally mature when we tied the knot. Now that we’re building a life together, I realize I have so much to learn. I have this dream of becoming a father, but my lack of self-awareness and decision-making skills makes both my wife and me hesitant. If I can’t take responsibility now, how will I manage a child?

I feel fatigued, tired, and demotivated all the time. I’ve talked to a medical professional, and I was diagnosed with low folic acid and vitamin D, which they said could contribute to my headaches and fatigue. I often suffer from migraines and sinusitis, which don’t help my mental state either. I have trouble remembering important things, crucial steps in daily tasks, and it upsets my wife. It’s tough to see how this impacts her, and I want to do better for both of us.

I also have significant anxiety when it comes to talking to new people. I avoid social situations as much as possible, and if there’s a group meeting, I find it hard to speak up even if I have questions. I bite my nails and the skin around my fingers constantly, which is another sign of my anxiety. I’ve even taken therapy sessions in the past for psychosexual issues, including struggles with fantasy, porn addiction, and masturbation.

Now that I’m in the UK and no longer under my mother’s control, I’m trying to stand on my own two feet. But I’m afraid to take jobs that require physical or technical skills—like making burgers—because I worry that I might mess up and get scolded or fired. The lack of self-confidence is paralyzing.

I’m reaching out to see if anyone has been through something similar or has advice on how to build confidence, improve decision-making, and navigate these challenges. I really need some guidance right now.

**TL;DR:** I’m struggling with anxiety, poor decision-making, and basic life skills due to a difficult upbringing with a narcissistic mother in Bangladesh. I dream of being a father, but my lack of self-awareness and responsibility makes both me and my wife hesitant. I’m desperate for advice on building confidence and improving my life."

"Hey everyone ! I'm new to reddit. 
I'm here cause I thought it's a cool platform where people help you , inform you &amp; you can have a good conversation with them. But why I haven't met nice people on Reddit yet ?

The second I posted something , someone who's 50 years old comes &amp; says something irrelevant. Then I respectfully reply to her but then she sends her friends and they all attack me with giving me down votes ( they literally gang up on me with down votes even if it's pretty ) which was very childlish of her. 

Then again I post some of my favorite things , people be commenting "" this is shite ""
And what I did was try to reply politely that everyone has a different taste.

Or overall every time I post something,
 People just come to somehow drag me down or be rude to me or be sarcastic.

I don't know what they've been through, but seems like every simple thing you do even when you don't mean anything bad, makes them attack you with their toxicity.

I also read some comments under other's posts and people were making fun and being rude to the OP. 

I couldn't care less about such people.  
I just don't wanna waste my time here if mature &amp; nice people won't show up.
All I mainly see here is people spreading negativity. So I'm realizing this app is somehow useless. 
I know that well cause I'm on other platforms and there you rarely meet such awful people. 

So what I should do ?
Should I just leave this app ?
Or there will be kind and nice people here too ? "
"I \[26F\] live with my parents and have been living with them since I graduated college in 2020. My mom and I have always had our ups and downs, but we had been really good lately and I thought I was maturing enough to where we could have a strong and healthy relationship. 

Today we got into an insane screaming argument about some family drama we have been dealing with related to other immediate family members. In my opinion it was something that spiraled out of control and was the result of me not knowing when to stop talking and let my mom have the last word. It has always been hard for me with my mom to just let things go, admit where I was wrong, and let her have the last word and I think it was even harder this time because I am an adult now. 

I know I said really hurtful things and I acted in ways that I think my mom will find unforgivable. I think we just need to give each other space and not talk for a few weeks, which will be hard because I live with her. When the time is right, how do I correctly apologize and take accountability for my actions? 

I know I might be too old to be asking this type of question, but I'm just upset with myself because I thought I was mature enough to not have crazy showdowns with my mom anymore, so I'm open to hearing new perspectives."

"Hi 21 (m) please is there someone I could talk to? 
I don’t feel so good"
"So, I work for one company [1], who is a partner of this other company [2]. 

I am closer to 2, so I work there. I have a separate computer for that company, and I act as if I’m an employee, when officially I’m not - but everyone considers me one.

Company 1 pays me. I don’t drive so I work from home a lot. They get people to give me rides into work sometimes when training is needed etc. I’ve been in this position for over a year. 

Lately, there’s been new management in company 1, which is great because before everything was messy. However, I’m starting to feel a bit useless. 

1 has brought in new administrators, which I have noticed have been doing some of my work for me. I don’t have much to do anyway after my big tasks are done, but this makes me feel worried that they are going to realise that and see me as useless. I have brought up to them that I feel a bit useless sometimes and they reassured me to say that I’m good at doing my work, and that I’m not useless. 

Anyways, company 2 are having a day where the entire company shuts down and has a gala in a nice location. I found this out because they emailed company 1 to notify them of this. I did not get an invite. This is part of the reason I feel like I don’t belong at 2. They’ve invited me on staff nights out before, but they forgot about me until the very last second. They have team meetings which I am not included in, despite it applying to my work for the company too. It makes me feel like I don’t fit in. There’s also a lack of younger people working there.

Company 1 is mostly young people. They mentioned an office night out this week, for a month’s time. I was in the group chat they announced that in. Apparently, they’ve been discussing this a lot. I’m getting worried that the group chat they put it in wasn’t meant to go in there, as I feel like they forgot I was in that one. If I ask my coworker that I am closest too, he’d probably say “of course you’re invited”. But I have a feeling that he’s the only one who likes me. 

He’s on holiday at the moment, and I’ve been trying to text in the office group chat more. I said something, and they ignored me. Then they were talking about something to do with lunch times. I’m working from home and I said I’m happy to have lunch at 1 to cover the phones. They posted the lunch timetable and I was not on there. 

My closest coworker, before he went on holiday, sent a message out to all of the department, which is quite small, saying how proud he was of us for handling the stressful day. This is stupid, but he added me last. And my overthinking brain is thinking “he didn’t want to add me, as I feel like I barely did anything, but he’d probably get shit from management if he excluded me” but then I was sitting there. Management wasn’t included on the message. Just our little department. He could’ve not added me and nobody would have said anything to me about it. But he chose to add me because he views me as part of the team. If it was anyone else they would’ve excluded me.

So now I’m sitting here feeling a bit like shit. I don’t feel like I’m apart of either team, and it makes me sad. "
"Hello, I just wanted to offer up some of my time to help or listen to anyone needing it. Even if you don't have any pressing issues and just want to tell me about your day I'd like to hear that to.

Just going through everything right now 
psychosis for the first time yesterday. We found her after hours of looking for her in a university resident naked at the front door. She was totally out of it. She said and did some very strange things that made me scared and very worried. I am currently the only family member who are in the same area as her and it's just so hard to bare. I do not know how to handle this alone. I try to stay strong for her but today I am just breaking. I feel so so sorry for her and my heart is just broken to see her like this. To see her so paranoid and confused and scared are getting to me. I want to take it away for her. I want her to be okay. I want her back.  
Title essentially explains. I'm very stressed at the moment and I'm not necesarily looking for advice but more someone who can listen (as I don't really have any friends who will). I'm also happy to be a listener for someone else :)
"Hey, just feeling very down and alone at the moment. Would love someone to talk to.

"So anyways i have a bunch of personality and mental disorders and physical issues, my adrenals are dying too, i kinda hate it

Call me whatever you want i dont care i hate everyone, i had enough, im not stepping out this house since 2018, first for health reasons, now more for bc i dont feel safe

I go out and i look the wrong way and boom, sexual harrassment allegation

I go out and someone tries to rob me and i punch them in the face, boom instant prison

I dont go out

I find people cruel, especially when they take pride in loving to see others being punished

I dont want anyone punished, not even my enemies, fuck that. Im not a barbarian

Noone gives a fuck honestly. Bc if i dont care then noone should care about me either, right?

But it makes me really sad, im unable to connect to new people and i just cant let go of the constant anger

I dont even have a place to show it. I have to beg to my parents to give me food or help to shower bc i cant even do that on my own anymore

If i tell someone im a narcissist, they instantly think of me as a montrosity, a villain

I just have a fucked up self esteem. I show that im amazing but i feel like im not even human

Im 90lbs and weak. Dependent on medication. 7 years of chronic illness. Its getting worse

"Hey names Nathan 18 Male going into my last few months of high school and getting ready for exams so feeling a little bit crap last few weeks, so I'm looking to talk to some people to take my mind off everything and just chill so here's a little background of myself!

About me I am a high school student in Australia completing his final Year and looking to talk to some new people to also take my mind off the impending exams....... I am someone who is very extroverted like legit when you get to know me I will never shut up....... I love sports cricket, basketball, tennis, baseball, soccer, football, footy, you name it!!!! I am a big fan of history like learning about Napolean and Rospierre absolutely lit!!!!

I am a huge fan of watching movies Star wars for me will always be my favourite series!!!! I like reading, a tiny bit of gaming I am an Avid fan of astronemy!!!!! I am a Aussie born with a sri lankan background so shout out to all my south and east asians!!!!! I am a devout catholic as well so shout out to my fellow catholics as well! lol

Now that you've heard a bit about me come and talk!!!! promise I am really nice and even if you wanna vent or share your problems I'm here to listen and give advice!! all i ask is don't be rude or ghost otherwise I don't wanna talk!!"
"I can't find any point of going on. I've nobody to talk to, nobody to express my emotions even. I'm just a piece of meat who is always expected to be alright, 100% of the time. If I'm not, I'm blamed. No one cared, no cares. I lost my hope, my optimism, what else is left? I wish i didn't have to choose to die, I wish it'd just happen suddenly. 

I don't know what I did to deserve a life like this. A hell. I've always been there for anyone in need, as much as possible. I've always respected people, I've always tried to be the best person I could be. But what's the point, if all of my efforts goes down the drain. I don't understand the world.

I want to leave this complicated world. Maybe be born again as humming bird and drink honey all life or be wind so that I'm not stuck. I hope I come back as person who is loved just like can love. I hope next time, it's easier.

"Heyyy,

I know how it feels to be overwhelmed by the thought of reaching out for help. It's not easy. Whether it's feeling like you'd be a nuisance, not wanting to look incompetent, or just not knowing what to ask—I've been there too. Maybe you’re like those who say they don’t want to bother others with their problems, or maybe you just don’t want to feel like a burden. It's okay if you don’t want to talk about how you’re feeling. We can chat about anything—random stuff, funny memes, the latest Netflix show, or just how your day was.

You’re not alone, even if it sometimes feels that way. I’m here, and you can message me anytime. Call me. Let’s be friends. I’m not offering advice, judgment, or solutions—just a listening ear and someone who genuinely cares. I know sometimes it’s hard to accept help, even when it’s offered. But know that I’m here, no strings attached.

We can laugh, vent, or sit in silence together. Whatever feels right. I want you to know that in this vast, sometimes lonely world, you’ve got someone in your corner.

So don’t hesitate. Hit me up anytime. We’re in this together

Idk i just wanted to reach out and talk to you since you may feel you cant bother other you can always bother me, I want to know your stories and listen to you, just want to say you are not alone this rando cares and is waiting for your dm, say whatever."
"Hi, it would just mean a lot to have someone to sympathize and support me rn. 

I’m 22 yrs old and I recently broke up with my partner of 2 years (though we were involved for closer to 3 and friends for 4) because she was having commitment issues and wanted to give up trying in our relationship. She brought up breaking up, and I agreed — it was the hardest decision I’ve ever made. I’ve already been struggling with mental health and we talked every day about building a future together, we fully intended to get married, but I just can’t be with someone who doesn’t want to be with me. I recently broke contact to discuss next steps (returning borrowed items, sharing the news with our friends, etc) and broached the topic of maybe making this “break up” a temporary “break,” which was an idea she was really eager to try just a few days ago. Now, she’s saying it’s a bad idea. It’s starting to really hit that this is the end of the road for me and my best friend, the person who promised to always love me.

I’m also planning to move to a new country in less than two weeks for a grad school program. This was a difficult transition to make before this huge change, and now, I’m feeling totally lost. My ex was supposed to join me to help move in and stay with me for a bit, and now I’m realizing I’m going to be braving this process completely alone. The timing really couldn’t be worse.

Right now, it just feels like I have nothing to look forward to. This time in my life was meant to be exciting, but all I feel is dread. I was on the fence about accepting this program, and it’s too late to back out now. I was really banking on having love and support to get through this, but now I’m so alone.  
I have very few close friends, my family is already stressed and busy, and now I’ve lost my soulmate. How do I handle this pain? How do I get through all the logistical, social, and financial challenges of this transition by myself? Everything takes so much energy and I literally can’t convince myself to eat anything. Has anyone else gone through something similar? Does it get easier? I really need some hope that I’m not just going to be struggling like this forever.  "
"My day was shit and life is shit. I wore an outfit I really love that I got a few weeks ago today and I learned that I have really really bad body odor and t-shirts wre kind of masking it. I'm pretty sure it's all the junk food I'm eating lately. People were nice but I felt so high on top of a cloud from the outfit that I was weird, I don't think pushy but definitely odd. I hate myself (a little strong but whatever) I hate my life I hate that I never learnt to take care of myself. I hate that i grew up poor and I'm surrounded by people with so many things i didn't have in life and i have to scream internally to not scream and throw things at them. I hate all of this and I hate that I have to spend my life with myself. I hate that I have to work so hard for something other people coast on. I fucking hate people. So many of them. And they're blissfully unaware and honestly I wish them the best good for them but fucking stay away from me you rich cunts. I hate this and I hate my dad for not being a man. I'm 26 and almost every one of our conversations in the past year are me teaching him things about life. I hate him. I hate him for not trying. For being weak. For being a fucking pussy and hoping to fuck women like that and stay innocent. Fuck him he's a coward. I'm actually face this shit and I'm alone. I hate him.

"Hey I just felt like reaching out cos I’m just generally struggling with depression and feeling kind of lost and directionless. My life is pretty crap and I just feel down about things all the time.

I have been depressed since I was a teenager and I’m on antidepressants which help me function but I feel low and exhausted all the time. Chronic insomnia too which doesn’t help. I have PTSD from some bad experiences as a child and also more recent abusive relationships have kinda messed me up. Most serious relationships I’ve been in have ended with guys taking advantage of me and hurting me. Have only really had one good relationship in my life and I drive him away by being self-destructive and a crap partner. Confidence is pretty much rock bottom as is my self esteem right now.

I’m currently living with my best friend who is also struggling a lot with her mental health. We have no other family cos we grew up in kind of an abusive household. I work part time as a waitress and also do sex work on the side. If you hate me for that it’s okay, I understand. It’s shit and not what I want to be doing but it pays the rent. I’ve looked for better jobs but can’t find anything. I dropped out of college cos I was sexually assaulted and my mental health went into a spiral. I have basically no qualifications. We don‘t really take care of ourselves, we smoke too much, drink too much, don’t shower enough. Our place is a mess and we are too depressed to do much about it, plus we are struggling really bad for money, like probably gonna be short on rent this month. I need £100s of work doing on my teeth which are in a really bad state and hurt me but can’t afford it. I feel tired most of the time and honestly I look rough as hell which makes my confidence even worse.

I just feel so trapped and lost in my life. Like I’ve fucked everything up and I don’t know where to start with anything. I was never a strong person and nearly every day I wake up and just want to go straight back to bed cos all I can see in my life is problems I feel powerless to fix. I hope I don’t sound too pathetic but I totally understand if you think I am. Anyway it’d be nice to have someone to vent to I guess. Thank you for reading my crappy life story lol."
"Hi! I am Mica (23 F) and I am worried for my future if i don't manage to mature some basic social skills

For context: i was always super shy and anxious, i have always had basically no friends [i am super shy, I am not really fun at all and surely lack(ed) initiative cause i was to afraid to be annoying], have always been the kid who does not say anything at all, always silent. Whatever i am sure this happens to a lot of kids and i am also kinda sure that many just grow out of it with time.
Not my case tho, i am 23 and still struggle to say even a word in pubblic, have no friend group (i managed to make 2 friends in highschool and i still see them sometimes, but that is litterally all my social life).

I cannot keep living like this, i feel clueless in all social situation and litterally my brain goes blank when i need to talk to people (not meaningfull conversation i litterally mean i struggle to talk to the chashier at the grocery store or with the professors during exams, or at works and so on), and fear i wasted all this formative year and i cannot ever grow past this.

[I accept all advices beside ""just be yourself"", i feel that choosing to be myself at a young age was surely great part of the problem. Now i am desperate and absoloutely open to play some kind of outgoing charachter to exist but i litteraly block]"
"I'm extremely anxious and restless because of fighting with my family several times in the last 7 days, also because of some challenging life events might be about to come soon and also because of being in a process of changing antidepressants(which makes me quite emotionally fragile), I would seriously appreciate it if someone could hear me out and help me distract myself."
"
I am a girl and I am 17. I met this boy (let's say that his name is Jo) the last two days on vacation. He is the same age as me. I was there without my parents. I wanted to have some fun, because I didn't have any experience with guys, and I didn't care so much, because i was in different country. He was my first kiss and my first physical touch (not sex). We've been on two dates and we spent the second night together on sunbeds at the pool. He was a gentleman and was very nice to me. The problem was that he said that he loves me and that he wants me to come again next year. I didn't believed him because you can't love someone after two days and I asked him three times if he said it just to have sex with me. He said  that he doesn't care that we don't know eachother, but he loves me because I am beautiful (I also don't think that love works this way). He said that he wants to have sex, but it is ok if I don't want to. When he was leaving we agreed to talk online.
 
On text Jo was saying that he misses me and that he loved me and that he loved every second we spent together. After couple days he started answering rarely and he didn't want to talk on the phone. I even told him that I'll ask my parents to go on vacation again there in the end of the summer (it is in another country, but it's only 5 hours with a car from my city). He said that he wanted me to come and that he is very happy to hear that. Later rhis day he had told me that he will go to another city in the evening with one of his friends, who is a girl. Than he stopped answering again.
Later in the evening when I decided to call him he rejected the call (i'm not sure if it is right in English). I texted Jo that it looks like he just wanted to sleep with me and that I think that he isn't honest. He answered womp womp. So I blocked him. 

The next day my best friend was texting with Jo and he said that this was his friend, who answered. He said that he just wanted to move on, but it was hard for him to call because he has dyslexia (he had told me that ge has it, but I don't think that it works like that). But he promised to call to say sorry and goodbye. My best friend promised him to talk to me, so he doesn't have to explain anything, he just has to say bye to prove his words about love. He didn't call until it was late at night and I texted him that I'll block him again. Than he texted that he is sorry and that i'm right. I said that it is completely ok for me to move on, but at least he should say bye on the phone. Also I was very tired and told Jo that he has to keep his promise to call me, but it has to be the next day because I really wanted to sleep. He said okay. He didn't call. When I called Jo the next evening some other boy (Jo's friend) answered. This friend told me that if I want to do something sexual I should come to his place. When Jo was leaving (after the night we have been by the pool) he had  promised me twice that he won't tell his friends anything about me. He clearly did and maybe he even lied about that night by the pool. When I finally talked to Jo on the phone he listened, than said that he is outside and that he didn't hear anything. He said that he will call after half an hour. He didn't. He texted that he is going to sleep and I texted  that i I'm tired trying to explain why he has to keep his word and at least call to say bye after he said many that he loved me and that he misses me. So i texted him to stop talking. He blocked me. And he posted a story with another girl (my bff had his profile, than she was also blocked). I know that he went going out with at least two girls after i got home. 

I understand that nothing serious can happen after two days, but I don't understand why he had to lie that he loved even when I got home. Why he was telling me to come again. I gave him multiple chances to prove that he wasn't lying and that he cared about me at least when I was there. I told him that it is ok to move on. I don't know why is it so hard to say that he doesn't want to talk anymore and that he doesn't think that he loves me anymore or that he didn't love me at all or that he found another girl. 

I really felt safe when I was around him. He was kissing my forehead, he was opening my water and he even carried me on his hands when I couldn't see where I was walking. When he bought ice cream for us, there was a cookie in his cup and he gave it me. He let me win dome points when we played games like ice hockey even if he played a lot better than me. He even introduced me to his little sister when we met her outside, his mother alsko knew that we are going on a date. I slept on him the last night. I really don't want to believe that someone can fake this things just to have a chance to sleep with a girl. When he was leaving he wished me to stay beautiful and happy. Well, I cried a lot because of him. I also couldn't eat a couple days. I know that maybe this isn't something serious because nothing really happened, but I let him to kiss me and touch me because I believed him and i really liked him.
 
But from the other side sometimes when he was touching me and I said no to something he stopped for a bit and then he continued trying again until I said yes. Also a l couple times when I said no, he made it look like he was trying to fix my skirt and said sorry, and than he tried again. It was night and I was very tired and really wanted to sleep but he still did that.  He said couple times that if I want I can go back to my room to sleep. I didn't do it because I wanted to stay with him.  But also I think that he let me sleep on him for couple hours. Before he left in the morning he tried again and I didn't say anything. He asked and when I said that I don't know he stopped and left. He said that after two or three hours he has to go to work. He relly qorks every day but I'm not sure if he left because he understood that I won't let him do anything. (Maybe I had to be more clear when I was saying no)

I really didn't wanted to believe that he was lying all the time. I'm scared that I won't understand if a boy is telling the truth or  he just wants to use me. I also don't know if I'm going to like someone else so much again. I don't know if I'm going to believe other boy. Also sometimee I feel the need to chat with boys online, because I want ro go on a date with someone and I hope thet I'll like him the same way as liked Jo. At the same time it's a bit disgusting for me when I think that other person can touch me or kiss me, so I reject all dates. I think that I compare other boys to him, because I found him very attractive. Also I miss him, even if he hurted me. I hope that he at least liked my appearance and didn't just thought that il will be easy. if it was me or some other girl. Can you give me some advice how to stop thinking about him. 

 P.s English isn't my first language, so sorry for the mistakes

"Hi everyone, I'm writing to you because I'm really desperate. my relationship with my parents has never been the best. Unfortunately, due to many dynamics (especially family ones), at the age of 13, I fell ill with an eating disorder from which I recovered a couple of years ago. I am now 21 years old and although I have done a lot of family therapy spying on my parents who put me in a bad light in front of others, always comparing me with other people's children, I felt bad, the situation has not improved, on the contrary it has gotten worse. My parents do nothing but complain about me being messy (which isn't true because I try to do everything I can, but maybe I forget something out of place). They say I never help around the house and they insult me for it.
Today I reached my limit. My mother kept complaining but the truth is that she simply does it to get my father's attention so that she can at least feel him next to her. In fact it's always like this she starts shouting and putting me in a bad light so that my father intervenes. She does it for every last thing, but today even though she saw that I was crying and having a panic attack and I asked her to stop, that I understood that I had to be more tidy and I even apologized to her, sh told me that I'm an actress that my excuses weren't true even though I swore they were. I begged him to stop always repeating that I'm messy, that I never help to give examples of things that maybe I forgot to put in order.
I felt terrible because I saw how badly she said all these things, the more my father told her that I was only playing the victim, that I'm still a child who can't deal with conversations without crying, the more heavy she became with her words.
Unfortunately I couldn't stand it any longer because I saw that she was doing it on purpose and I wondered how my mother was capable of saying all those horrible things, even though they saw me suffer and I begged her to stop knowing what I went through and then I started scratching myself but not even this stopped them. I can no longer stand my mother who does everything to put me down and have my father's attention, I'm tired of being used. I don't know how to free myself from this toxic family. Unfortunately, I am a first year university student and I have no financial independence. I have to leave this family because they are destroying you, I don't feel loved, in fact I just feel like a puppet. I can't even talk to anyone about it because it's a delicate situation. every day she always creates these discussions even for the slightest inconvenience, I never hear myself say I love you, but a hug, but a thank you, I feel alone in the world."
I think I know what's going on I just want to rant..
"I had a pretty weird childhood where looking back it was so so bad but as a kid i thought my childhood was perfect. From the outside it really was. Had loving and financially comfortable parents, good friends, good grades, went to a very prestigious university, earned six figures straight out of school. And then one day in my mid 20s I started to have trouble functioning with very basic things. I got diagnosed clinical depression. Stopped functioning almost completely soon after so had to leave my job.

It's been three years since then. did a ton of intense therapy. Realized that i had severe anxiety. Realized it's not normal for my parents to default to thinking im not good enough. Realized that i was always *told* what to do and never ever asked how i felt. And as a result everything I've ever done in my first 25 years of life was more of less against my will. but i kept doing them bc i thought life just wasn't supposed to be comfortable. I was never allowed to have my opinions or my motivations, and as a result i was a very ""easy to raise"" kid for my parents. Realized that since i was never allowed free thinking or motivation, i procrastinate bc I solely rely on the urgent-ness to motivate me. And then one day even deadlines can't scare me into motivation anymore. I was just like, im done. I'm not doing this anymore. It's like i've used up every last drop of my functionality and energy. I was depleted. still am. sometimes i'd be starving but still have trouble ordering food on uber eats bc i just don't want to do anything anymore. even if it's something as simple as ordering food delivery, even if im starving.

anyway. today is a particularly hard day for me bc it's my dad's birthday and i can't find the energy to pick up the phone and wish him a happy birthday. some might say ""don't think, just do"", but that was the only way i functioned for 25 years and i just physically can't do another iteration of it. It was same thing with my mom's birthday a couple of days ago, all day that day i wanted to call her to say happy birthday but just like everything else in my life rn, the more i want to do something the more my body just feels done and wouldn't let me do it.

i don't think i will be able to call my dad today :( dad im so sorry"
"24F I have discord! 

I’ve been having a lot of events happen so I’m just feeling down. "
"I (24/F) from India. When I was a kid, my mom used to beat me.. for not getting good grades, misbehaving, doing anything bad (be it lying or stealing small stuff or anything that doesn’t please her) When I try to remember anything from my childhood, all I can remember is her beating me up.. with whatever she can get.. broom, rolling pin, stick, broom, spatulas.. It’s not like she didn’t love me.. after beating me, she regrets and cries and apologises for it the next day and cooks my favourite food.. other than those episodes generally she was very nice to me.. 

My father comes home late from office usually.. by the time my mom will be done with me.. she’ll be giving me punishments like kneeling down , bending down (the murga like punishment) , she used to threaten me with hot spatula that she will burn my skin which will leave a mark and I will be reminded of it every day..which she accidentally did once or twice..  
Once when I was 6, I went out and played with my friends without her permission and she hit me infront of the house and my friends dropped my slippers inside the compound wall without her noticing..
And when I was 10, she was hitting me with a belt and the buckle scratched my nose bridge.. and I started blending.. she got scared and took me to the hospital.. it was nothing just a scratch.. I lied to the doctor telling him that I fell.. 

I was a good student, I used to get good grades.. but she was wanted me to be extraordinary.. she used to yell at me even if I was second or third in class.. 
I used to be scared after every semester after report cards and every PTA meeting.. I have thought about running away from my mom since I was 9 years old.. I used to think that she will find me and hit me again for running away.. 
I was scared of her till 10th grade and I got good marks in 10th grade (5th in the state)
And then after that I was tired of all the taunting and I just didn’t want to study.. she used to hit me… till I bleed and I will just stand there crying like beat all you want… she used to get angry and beat me harder.. they were even called out by the principal because how come a student like me become this bad.. (at this point, my marks were really low) .. So I scored really low marks in my final board exams.. That day she started wailing and started hitting me saying how she worked so hard to make me study.. telling it was all for my good.. That was the last day she hit me..(2016).. 

I wrote NEET( Entrance exam for med school) and I got qualified..got into a private college ( they remind me of the fee they paid almost everyday) and I became a doctor.. I worked for a year and now I am at home..preparing for my Post-grad exams . 
I’ve been living with my parents for a while now and I can’t stop thinking about what they did when I was a kid and how my father didn’t say anything at the time.. 
Now she is very proud, yells sometimes but she never brings that old stuff up.. She tells that I used to study because she hit me.. and I got arrogant in high school that’s why I got low marks.. and that she tells that I turned out okay-ish because she beat me..
Now since I have the upper hand, I tell her that she didn’t treat me right and I deserved better.. I would have turned out better if she did not hit me.. She cries whenever I bring that up.. telling that she didn’t enjoy hitting me.. she just wanted me to be a good student… she did it all for me and my dad supports her..  She never apologised to me.. she still says what she did was right..
They are otherwise very good to me, my mom gets me expensive clothes, jewellery, my favourite food.. 
I had a younger sister who had some epilepsy issues from when she was a kid.. so she didn’t go through this.. She had an entirely different childhood. 

My grandmother (her MIL) used to mentally abuse her at around the same time.. my father never went inbetween those two..
I have read that some parents bring out their frustration to hit their kids.. 
I want to forgive her.. but sometimes I want to say everything and remind her what she had done.. 
And I used to think that in the future if I am to have a kid, I am not letting it near them. But then I am sure they will never hit the kid, they’ll be really kind.. I just want revenge.. which at this point doesn’t make any sense 
I just want to forget and forgive them.. I need some advice please.."
"As the title pretty much states, I just found out my crush has a bf. This happens all the time. Could use a kind voice. "
"I ll try to keep it as short as i can , i had a lot of nice memories with her , then things got complicated . We were distant and we had a distant relationship .

"I've kinda been letting things get to my head, with lots of screaming at home between family members, low confidence etc, could really use someone to vent to or get advice from😅thank you in advance!"
"Before I left home. I was dealing with a great deal of suicidality. So much so, I couldn’t move some days. I couldn’t function, exist, or do anything. 

I was dealing with, sexually demeaning comments from my brothers wife, whom, I never stood up to. So all I knew was lack of boundaries, safety, and care at home. 

My brother abused me as a child. But I didn’t stop talking to him, before I left. And honestly. I feel like, I couldn’t stop. I didn’t know how, I thought he changed a bit.

These constant, sexually demeaning bullying comments gave me a lot of depression and I went to toxic mentalities. One of which that I’d never be with a girl, because my family abused me, and I never worked. 

My father was also angry at me because he said I hated him. One day however I stood up to him, and I was irate about him disclosing something personal about me. 

1-2 hours after the argument my father attacked me. He reared his head into me, trying to get me to fight him, and started grabbing my shirt, then, he started grabbing things to hit me with, and threaten me. 

I left to my brothers house, where I planned to go and leave forever. Making a life for me with my uncle. 

My brother kicked me out after 2 weeks of staying there. He gave me one day to go home. I stayed somewhere and spent a lot of money.

I went to Florida/Texas after to live with my uncle and for 2 years I struggled with paranoia, and panic about home. Even miles away. 

My uncle told me to get my license in New York but I explained that I didn’t want to go home because of my family. 

I told him I want to stay somewhere else. 

I met a lovely person on here who helped me for hours on the phone, who consoled me, tried to help me see not to go home. I didn’t want to either. I was terrified of returning home.

I went to New York, to find that the place I was staying was dirty, and very bad conditions. Multiple people living there.

I was too scared to go home( in New York with dad), but after 2 months I went home, and I been home 9 months I been home.

I stay away from brother and sister in law, and I live with my dad, very seldom talking to him. 

I blme myself for staying at the bad apartment. I feel stupid and weak. Is it my fault? 

Why ddidnt I just go him the first day with the bad conditions? I was scared. I feel stupid and weak. And I’m home anyways.

I still am struggling with driving. Didn’t pass yet, and struggling to do it.

Should I blame myself? Is it my fault for staying in a dirty place? 

And taking 2 months to decide I have no choice but to go home? "
We can voice chat or just message. We can talk about whatever you need to or formulate some kind of distraction if that will help. I can’t sleep tonight and thought I’d offer an ear in case someone needs one.

Please at least read. 

If you read my most recent post I really need a mom who loves me and doesn’t call me evil. She’s hated me for a long time saying since I was 10 that I was satanic and going to hell and that I’ll never be happy. And she was right she set me up to fail bc anything better than how she treated me I fell victim to, and thought that meant someone loved me. I’m 25 now and my life has completely fallen apart and I have to live at home bc I’m struggling so bad and she tells me I’m a burden and that I shouldn’t be here. And that I’m 25 so she doesn’t have to take care of me. I mean both of my parents said that last part, but I’m so tired. I did everything I was supposed to as a kid, I wanted her to love me so freaking bad but she never did. Can anyone be my mama please? I’m a sweet girl I’m just not mormon so she hates me. But even before I left she hated me. I’m going through a lot. Like unbearably a lot. Please anyone to tell me I’m not evil? I’m just a kid. "
"Backstory : my dad passed away 2 years ago from covid pneumonia, and my mom was the person to believe covid wasn’t real, that doctors are horrible and purposely kill people with covid for money, stats and etc with medicine . Whatever theory she believed it.  She tells me the hospital killed my dad because of a medicine she told them to not give him (screaming at them on the phone about it as my dads deathly ill), has talked to lawyers and is in countless facebook groups dedicated to it. 

Normally i can ignore this and just leave myself out of the conversations, but now it is affecting me… I have had stomach issues the past couple of weeks, and yesterday i asked to go to the doctor to see if they can help, she tells me “doctors are horrible they only make you worse”. She still let me go but just harassed me , today after my appointment she asked about what they said and i just gave her the basic run down and she telling me i need to take all these vitiams  and whatever else , i brought up i would like to see and find a GI doctor to help me and she started fighting me saying “you need to change what you eat” i replied “yes but they will help me figure that out” she goes on about “the world is so used to thinking doctors help when they make you worse, just look at dad” It’s upsetting because it feels as if her theories are being put above my health constantly in every day life. It’s just exhausting..

"Feel like my whole lifes been taken away from me, I suffer from extremely bad anxiety, ptsd, depression and have a lot of child hood trauma. My girlfriend who I had loved with all my heart left me awhile ago in an extremely cruel way and is continuing to be cruel playing on my insecurities etc etc I loved this girl more than life itself and depended on her so much i sacrificed so much trying to build our future. I spend most my days with anxiety and panic attacks, shaking and crying for hours alone with no one to talk to since throughout the relationship she isolated me more and more removing all my friends from my life. Would love someone to just chat with in general I have no one anymore, I just want someone I can speak to when I'm having panic attacks I'm so tired of being alone, throwing up and crying for hours.

21m from Australia, can add on discord for calls and stuff if you want, I like to think im pretty friendly and fun to talk if I'm dying from anxiety 😅 I love sports, video games, fantasy universes, TV shows, movies, books, and writing."
"I’ve had a lot going on. A lot of drama as you can tell from my post history. I’ve been really anxious. I even ended up texting my ex and asking her to be friends again but I feel like that’s no use because I have reason to believe one of the people I have drama with has talked shit about me to her.

I feel like there’s no one I can be with to just relax. I feel like maybe I kinda hate myself and don’t know why.

I’m not looking for someone to solve all my problems. Just someone to talk to who’ll be kind and supportive"
There's a storm outside and I'm scared shitless. I should also be sleeping for the last two hours but I can't so now I'm looking for a distraction from the storm.
"I’m constantly depressed (yay depression), worried about everything (yay anxiety), and incredibly lonely. I’m 24 and have never even kissed a girl. I’m in a wheelchair now too (and it turns out that scares girls away, who would have guessed /s). Like sure, it’s not permanent, but it’s been more than 5 years since I got stuck in this wheelchair and likely have *at minimum* a few more years of this. I have no social skills either. I can’t really see any light in my future.

It would be better if I was happier with myself at least, but I don’t even have that. I’ll be honest actually, I despise and pity myself, and constantly feel pathetic.

Sorry this was kind of a rant but I could kind of use some kind words if anyone doesn’t mind."

Hello, I just wanted to talk about this with other people and see what I can do, because I have bad anxiety and I’m freaking out as I’m texting this.

Context:

I have a friend group online that consists of about 6 or 7 of us, I don’t remember. But, one of those friends, let’s call them “M”, is apart of that.

This person had a weird obsession with some characters, but I didn’t mind it, It became repetitive that they *always* wanted me to draw this character, pleading both me and my friend to draw them, yet we kept saying no all the time. Overall, they were weird at times, but me and my friend group would be honest with them.

I’d say my friendship with this person was fine, well to my eyes. We both would always fight over which one of our fictional crushes are better, and we would make fun of each other too. That was what he had for a few weeks since I met them, and I didn’t think it was a problem with them. For example, they joked with someone to me, which went like “stop hurting urself” and M said “is it because he’s emo”, or “Bro has dementia”. Those jokes. (But I never made it that far). The only jokes I made was calling them “Eeww” whenever they joined us in servers, or we both would make fun of our favorite fictional characters, which they also have done sometimes too, and we would continue annoying each other with who was the best fictional crush, lol.

*Whole point is, I never thought it was a problem because me and my other friend would make jokes like that with them, and they would as well. I just thought that was how their humor was due to how we always did it every time. It was just back and forth.*

Until, they started to become distant, days ago from now.

I started to text a mutual friend through them, and was questioning, “where did M go? I haven’t seen them in a while”. Their friend, let’s call them, J, would tell me “they hadn’t been feeling good”.

Then, I talked through J more, we started to become close and good friends. 

I messaged up M and said “Hey, it’s been a while. Is everything okay?” And to which they replied. “oh, tbh I forgot about you”. 

*It was weird, because it had only been like 4 days since they hadn’t seen me. I figured something was wrong.*

After that days pass, I came to find out, that the reason they became distant was because of me. They said I had made them feel distant, and felt they themselves brought the whole group down, or the reputation. 

I felt bad, so I wrote paragraph after paragraph, apologizing to them that…

*“didn’t mean the jokes, I’m sorry, I don’t hate you at all, and I should have been better with them, I didn’t know they hurt you because we would share them back and forth, so I thought that’s how ur humor was.”*

Also, I felt bad cuz this was really late at night, but they were up, and texted back “I’m trying to sleep”, “why are you doing this” (the paragraphs of apology), and “is there something you want?”

I feel horrible. First, I’m scared that I will end this person off with a bad note, and ruining their trust issues with other people. Two, I’m scared other friends will also see me as rude, and the whole group would see me as terrible and leave. Three, I’m worried that I won’t ever change as a person, and this will just keep happening over and over again.

I’m terrified. Tomorrow, J wanted me to speak to M in a private room. I’m scared they are going to text dry, and not listen to my apology. I’m scared to explain this to everyone else, even though they never really hanged out with M as much, just me and J.

I feel like awful, and I’m scared if I’ll say the wrong things. What can I do? How can I give the proper apology? And what would you do in this situation if you were me? I’m freaking out badly and usually when things are my fault, I start to shake uncontrollably. What can I do? 


**I don’t want to push anyone, but I’m expected to be talking with them tomorrow about this matter. I’m terrified and I don’t know what to do, or If im ready at all.**

Update: I’ve talked with M and I don’t think it went well. I made the best apology people had given me advice for, I respected their feelings and comfort, but it didn’t end well. While I was talking to them, they were private chatting J this:

“This is boring”. “I don’t want to be here.” “This is awkward, I want to leave.” “Bro needs to stop yapping”. “I want to say sorry but i don’t know how.”

*And a few more messages about other friends of the group that they thought were rude and weird.*


When reading this I felt even worse. I think they may need time, but I also feel I’m ruining this even more. I basically just apologized and explained myself, but I don’t think that was a right time to. 

I need help. I hope I’m not being rude. It also turns out J also had the same situation with M, so I hope they understand my side. Please be honest with me :(

I’m also scared that maybe I started all of this, and was rude to them, but my memory is awful.

Edit: I js realized I put “F” im ftm "
"I have been watching a show called Orange is the New Black. It's about prison basically. In one scene, a CO who used to be a soldier I guess was talking to another CO who did something very bad, on accident. He explained to his coworker how whne he was in Afghanistan he'd make kids juggle grenades until one blew up and would shoot the kid, and would strangle girls he had sex with (raped, really) when he was done bc their village would do it anyways or something. Pretty much saying you just need to get over stuff.

I KNOW this show is fiction, mostly. But how common was this kind of stuff in Afghanistan? I'm crying typing this out because I feel disgusting and sick this really fucked me up fuck I just feel DISGUSTING

Reason being is that I used to speak to this guy. He was an old guy, much older than me but we liked eachother. He fought in Afghanistan, afaik. Honestly part of me thought he was lying, idk why. But anyways, he was extremely kind. Like to the point I felt very attached, no one showed me kindness the way he did, he made me feel very comfortable. But one time I was just joking, I said tell me a secret. I wasn't really looking for anything, I was expecting a joke. But then he comes back with ""I'm going to my grave with some things I've done""

And like at the time I'm like ""okay... anywho"" like I thought it was weird but I guess I didn't REALLY know the realities of the stuff. I guess I just thought he was ashamed of the general aspect of violent combat, I don't know. Anyways but NOW as I watch this clip, I'm like holy shit. Like I spoke to this guy for a good while, we were pretty intimate. It was an online thing but he would joke about being together and everything, we spoke really intimately and not just intimate in a sexual way. Anyways, he ended up ghosting me pretty recently. I was pretty upset, but things happen. It's fine. I can guarantee he just found someone else and was bored of me

I just feel disgusted with the thought that he could have done some of that stuff.. I don't know what subreddit this even belongs in. It's stupid, its a hypothetical. But still. He would often comment that he was a 'bad man'. Then again, he also referred to dirty things as 'bad' so I never really understood his lingo.

I just feel sick and disgusted right now, like fuck and I do have some prior knowledge of the USAs war crimes and I just feel revolted and fucking weird. I don't know how to process this, and I don't even know what \*this\* is... its a hypothetical I'm coming up with.. its a hunch. But it's really just bothering me"
"Hello, I currently suffer from anxiety, ptsd, depression, and an eating problem. Sadly, I don’t have very many real life- in person friends. But I’m hoping to make a long term friend online to talk to. possibly shoulder to cry on, someone to vent to, and maybe hang out with in person. I’m longing for an escape from my current reality. Preferably with people within my age group. Currently feeling bored, sad, etc.. 

It seems anytime I try and reach out to someone they’re either looking for an Instagram follow. Or seeing if I’m single.

"Both her presence and absence in my life hurt me at this point. I sometimes kinda wish she were just an uncaring asshole so I could stop caring about her and get over her as I can stop caring about people very easily if they show that they are like that; but that's not the case, it's quite the opposite.

There is some history to why both her presence and absence hurt me, and I would seriously appreciate if someone provided me with some company during this emotional turmoil so I can talk about it a bit."
"I'm tired. I'm 33yo female and I have not have a single friend in my life. Unbelievable right? It's true. And it's not for lack of trying. There's just something wrong with me. I've tried for so long to fix it from trying new things, joining clubs, exercising, meditation, nothing works. People just don't want me. I'm so lonely and I'm losing my will to live. People tell me I have a sad look on my face. Well you would too if you were in my shoes.
 My therapist is useless. She's not the first useless therapist I've had. I joined a sports team last summer. People said the exercise would make me feel better and being on a team would help me make friends. Well it didn't work. I'm so bad at the sport that I'm embarrassed to play and I bring the team down. And my teammates are nice but I can tell they don't want me around. They'd be better off without me. I don't want to quit because I do enjoy playing but it feels bad to enjoy it when I'm the liability for everyone else. I don't know what to do anymore."
"At least I think so. Full time single Dad since I was in highschool. That's not why I'm here, that was a long time ago and I'm more than I'm a good place with everything. 

My daughter however is not grown, just finished school and moved across country. It's a long weekend here and my first one alone in practically 2 decades. 

I'm not sad, or depressed or anything like that. I just fine myself thinking (now that I have time for it), do I even really know who I am?

Like what do I do now. There's not a single guy I know I'm my position. Most are thinking of starting families and mines already grown. It defined me, is all I've known? Seriously what do I do now? What makes me, me? 

Anyway I don't know thanks for listening."
"Hey everyone, I hope you're all having a wonderful day. If you're not for whatever reason and would like someone to be there and listen, you're more than welcome to drop me a message. If you need advice, support or just someone to hear you out, I'm here for you.

I work in the charity industry, so I've seen it all. There's no judgement here.

You can send me a chat or a message on here, whichever is more comfortable for you.

Have a good one 😌"

Hey. I (most likely) have extremely severe OCD with schizophrenia features. Extreme OCD panic tonight. Just need a calm conversation
"I mean, the title speaks for itself. He got drunk, told me how he was really feeling, we argued for a while and I finally said now is not a good time to talk about this (mostly because he was forgetting details and calling me a liar because of it) and he said ""finally, now that you want to end the conversation we can end it"" Etc. Until finally he said it's ""painful and miserable"" being with me so I said ""then why are you"" ""I don't know"" ""okay.... then don't be."" ""Fine."" Now he's out for a walk and it just started raining. Idk how it'll be when he comes home but I doubt it'll be any better. I don't know if I want it to be.

I have no friends, no family that I can talk to about this. I need someone for support though a hard time. Just to vent and feel better about how it's ending"

I know it might seem insane but i often feel like I’m the worst person in the world. I’m in therapy and I’m trying to fix this. I don’t engage in “negative self talk,” but the feeling remains. "
My sh urges are coming back again it's starting to get unbearable to not do it. I'm thinking of just ending it soon istg nothing ever goes right for me. People keep leaving me no matter how hard I tried suicide just seems like my only option where I can remain even somewhat happy

I do it because of the hatered I feel towards myself. I dont feel good doing it, i dont feel good afterwards. And during it the only thing I feel is this  pure rage. Im usually not an angry person so this ""version"" of me terrifies me"". So how scared should I be? How scared should I be that one day I will cut my vains opet because of this hatered.

"Today I saw someone who was my age post their face for a rating, people didn’t call her ugly, but they did say she looked older than her age. The thing is I think we looked similar in a way (could just be dysmorphia) and she was asking if plastic surgery could make her look younger. People said it will only make her look older. I almost cried because that’s the situation I’m currently in. I feel so lost because everything seems not to be unachievable.

(This part is unrelated to the girl) I’m 18F and one of my biggest dreams is to be able to live comfortably in my body. I want to embrace being feminine and young but my appearance is in the way :((  I don’t want to ever be a sexy mature girl, I want to be a cute young one"
"I try not to take things personally or make friends at work. But sometimes is too much. It's not a first job, I'm rather old. I work for this hotel in the food and beverage department, the breakfast buffet specifically. 

I have people I get along well. I try to be as helpful. One the BOH staff who is not attractive himself touched my tummy and would say I'm pregnant since I have gained weight. I was always in good terms with him so no idea why he acted so. One the managers saw the gesture and forced me to report it to HR. After I did, that coworker was suspended for a week and then all of the BOH started disliking me. The chef is vulgar and sides with them and acts like a teenager making comments about looks and stuff. He tells the kitchen I make all these money in tips and they don't get anything so NOBODY F****** helps me. The cooks ask me to do things that they are supposed to do like put the food in the container. They don't care, they ask me to and they ask me to use my hands and are on their phone. I have a hand injury and ask for help like carrying plates and they don't care. Chef tells me to work harder. 

They have a few other employees including managers. Only 1 manager really works and cleans. I work with this girl manager who is constantly on her phone. She never helps. Their reasoning is, ""Oh you are full-time and make tips.""

There is no food and beverage director, they can't find anyone because they dont pay a lot, so the main manager is a 21 year old girl who never done this before. 

Today I got so tired. Literally the girl manager was on her phone texting her bf and I had to buss, refill, check guests in. She didn't care.

The only reason I keep this is because I'm full time and have benefits. But it's exhausting and no other workers help."

I experienced an assault by a doctor 10 years ago and am planning on telling my parents this week. I'm really scared. I told my sister and cousin but feel guilty for hiding this. I went through the complaints process and to the police by myself. I'm sad I didn't give them the opportunity to support me during that time so I feel bad. Just need some encouraging words.

"Hi. 18F. I have depression and body dysmorphia. People often discourage me or try to make things seem better than what is reality. I just want to have some faith in changing myself and not be judged for wanting plastic surgery :(( It’s been really hard to keep going. I feel uncomfortable in my body, and I’ve been in this depressive state state since the end of last year. My issue is that I don’t look adorable or young for my age. I don’t want to be mature or hot. I’m so scared about not being able to become who I am, I haven’t been myself since my appearance contradicts it. I’m very sensitive about it. I want to cry when someone looks at me or compliments me. I’ve tried the minimal things such as makeup and skincare. It’s not working out. I can’t even go outside anymore because it bothers me so much. I’m so screwed. The only thing that gives me hope is getting plastic surgery over with. Not my future, not love, not even being popular. "
"I’m 22f and I have no friends and don’t speak to my family. I’m extremely apathetic and I’m depressed so I don’t have any hobbies. Nothing interests me.

My supervisor is beyond the best. I laugh a lot there, really. I feel really happy there. I don’t know why I’m feeling so sad over this tonight. 

I had a day off today and tomorrow too. I don’t really care for my days off. I feel so empty and lonely because I have no one to talk to. I go to the gym and have my meals but that’s about it. I drive around sometimes. Go shopping. Take myself to my favorite boba place. I’ve been to concerts by myself and have 2 coming up later this year. I know people say you should feel content being by yourself but damn it would be nice to have a friend to come with sometimes. It’s so lonely. I look forward to going to work. My coworkers and my supervisor really do not know how much I look forward to seeing them again. "
"45 f. I’ve Been dating someone for a year and I think we are breaking up. I am so sad, and hurt, and angry. Mom of 3 and I stayed single for 10 years. I waited so long to date after a bad marriage,  so I could heal and grow and so my kids would be older before I brought a new man into their life. I was so lonely but wanted to do what was best for my kids.  Finally started dating 2 years ago. The first one ended in total heartbreak. Think this one is going to be the same. I am just so freaking sad. "
"So, they raised my rent by almost $200. That might be fine, but I am on disability income and after everything‘s all set and done, I’m literally going to only have $50 for the month. I’m stressing out. I don’t know, what to do. My only glimmer of hope is to get my voucher for subsidize housing, but God knows how long that’s going to take. I’m mad at the world, screw everything. Don’t understand why housing has to be so damn expensive.
Oh, and before someone says for me to shack up with a roommate, I’m living with a family member, and they have the final say on how that goes. They’re not open to having anyone else move in and be on the lease.

"When I was a kid a teacher told my mother I would never get a job. She was right.

At the same time a bully told me I would never have a girlfriend. He was right.

More recently I've heard the average age of death for autistic people like me is 35, that my choice of hobby makes me subhuman and deserves to be miserable my whole life, and that being lonely is always ALWAYS one's own fault. What if they turn out right too?

I tend to believe every bad thing said about me so I'm always watching my own behavior like a hawk but slip up anyway. Just don't feel cut out for this world."
"I had to put down my 10mo pup yesterday, and I'm a wreck. I've never had a pet put down, they've all passed from old age. He was aggressive and violent - he hurt our livestock, and he jumped a 5ft fence and attacked the neighbors service dog. It was a huge vet bill and and the dog needed stitches. I've never had an animal that was so aggressive. I took him to be put down before animal control could do it, so that he was with someone who loved him during the process, but fuck, it hurts, and I'm so upset. I don't know, I've suffered a lot of loss and pain the past two years, and any kindness or pictures of well loved pets will be appreciated. "

"I'm 19 an have been extremely depressed in the last year. I graduated top of my class and got into a great school, but fell in with the wrong crowd and started smoking weed and experimenting with shrooms my first year of college. I only really tried shrooms once and didn't like it, and I smoked weed pretty consistently but I've since quit and don't plan on ever going back. My 2nd semester ended up being a disaster because of my depression and at the last minute I had to withdrawal from my classes to save my gpa bc I couldn't handle school. I've decided college isn't for me and the only job I can think of that I would ever want to do is become a firefighter. Other than my mental health issues I would be a great candidate so my plan was to work for a year or 2 in order to reign in my depression, after which I would apply to become a firefighter. But I recently learned all of the fire departments near me use a polygraph test in their hiring process.

 Because I was stupid and tried drugs when I had no direction in life, there is no chance I'll be able to become a firefighter or work in any government job. I've heard they may overlook the weed but the time I tried shrooms is a dealbreaker. I'm devastated. That was the only job I could ever imagine liking and I ruined my chances with one stupid fucking decision. I don't see any point in moving forward anymore."

"Literally not a single thing I can think of in my entire life has ever worked out for me.

I can’t think of one time things have gone “right”.

And now I’m to the point that I can’t even afford to live. 

So then what is there? 

Nothing helps, therapy, pills, meditation, journaling, volunteering, classes, etc etc etc. 

After all this hard work, blood, sweat and tears, I’m somehow worse off now than I was over ten years ago….

"So I went to therapy before and I went to different ones but none of their advice doesn’t work for me 

When I told everyone that therapy doesn’t work for me…. I get screamed at and getting name called for saying that I prefer to do activities (Traveling because I hate the city that I currently live at) to improve my mental health and I did take their advice but they only told me to go to some bars and I hate going to bars for lots of reason.

I work on myself a lot by going to college, volunteering at the animal shelter (which I’m still a beginner when walking with dogs) and I also travel  to a big city to get away from my shitty ass job and my boring and shitty City!

"People tell me to be more vigilant. I used to be, before 12 years of therapy. I don't wish to blame my therapist for making me vulnerable but my adult used to be out more, my protector, and though they were an ah to people, that is what was needed. Well, now it's me most of the time because I didn't feel much need for the adult anymore and they also haven't felt the need to come out while I've been by myself. I thought I could do this, try to trust and love people but I keep getting ran over and people keep blaming me for this because I'm poor and homeless. I should be more aware of what is going on but I don't understand any of it. None of this makes any sense to me because I remember things being different with strangers and that is what my mind defaults to.

I need to live somewhere there are kind people. I need to see warm genuine smiles, and I don't want to be around anyone trying to take advantage of me or other people. I want people to see my worth, realize that I am capable of doing what I know to be true and incapable of doing the things they keep trying to push me towards. 

I want to be a farmer. I want to grow a bountiful harvest for my local communities, and I never want to be rich or poor. I don't want either of those distinctions to exist. I don't want to be limited to what I'm allowed to do or what I'm not allowed to do based off of other's assumptions. I just want to be somewhere I can exist and other people can exist and we all want the same things, to be fair to each other and happy in life. 

I'm trying to summon my adult more, to protect me, but I don't think they can handle this world either. I made them based off of old references. I don't understand the world today. I haven't understood what an adult is but the adult I created sufficed. I got by by dating older women who simply told me what they were looking for and the adult gave it to them, and they gave me some direction in life. I could play pretend adult with them if my protector wasn't available, and I was really good at that sometimes, though not after the others came out. The others sometimes ruined things, especially the teenager.

I did well with my therapist too. She never told me what to do but she did offer her opinion and that helped me a lot. I still wound up in bad situations when she wasn't around but I learned how to react better because she constantly reminded me whenever I forgot how to deal with people. I felt safe with her guidance. 

I don't feel safe anymore. She's been gone over a year, and I'm now seeing the world for what it really is. An underworld maze full of dangerous traps and a neverending cacaphony of people yelling at me telling me it's my fault as I venture through this wondering when I'll ever be able to be at peace. Now the heavy ringing is back and the front of my head has a sharp dull ache. My sanity is slipping away."
"I have been unwell most of my life but this fuels thoughts more, I cant stand intensity of emotions. It's been too long and too much to see hope for change. "
"This vent is kinda divided in 2 halves since these are 2 fairly different things I'm dealing with.

First off: I crave intimacy. I'm almost 21 and have never been in a relationship, kissed or even held hands with anyone. I've had crushes on close friends multiple times but it's never happened that someone had feelings for me. It makes me feel lonely. I really want to be held and loved, but I just can't. Every moment I spend alone hurts, which sucks because I'm someone who needs his alone time so I kinda just have to go through the pain of loneliness.

Then there's my regrets over a previous friendship. I was best friends with a girl I'll call J. At one point, I caught feelings for her, but after a few months I got over them. However, since we were so close it wasn't unusual for me to give her compliments or talk to her daily. But because I used to have feelings for her, all that made her think I was still in love with her despite having gotten over my feelings. Then there's also the fact that I'm fairly insecure, especially back then. After a while, almost every single conversation was me needing help or support. We were best friends and I treated her way too much like a therapist than an actual friend. These things ended up leading to a pretty big argument between me and her then-date and I where I misinterpreted our argument as them wanting to end this friendship. I stopped texting her after that, thinking they wanted nothing to do with me anymore. 

Months later, she suddenly sent me a long text telling me how appalling it is that I ghosted her for months. It made me realise how I completely missed the point of our admittedly heated argument. I felt so bad. She gave me the chance to talk it out and after a few days of slowly talking about it I just... Stopped. I regret it so deeply. I fucked up in our friendship, then fucked up when she made her thoughts about my actions clear, and then months later when she gave me another chance, I blew it yet again. Even though I luckily have other friends I care deeply about, it hurts to know that I hurt this person I cared about so deeply, and that every chance I got to make things right got ruined by my own stupidity and lack of communication. I'm so scared of this happening again, of me being so dense and dumb again."
"How can anyone get his own life? I am not really interested in anything even though I've tried to learn a lot of things like web development, graphic design, animation, making videos, cooking, drawing...etc but didn't like any.

I'm a social anxious so I have 0 friends and have a peeve of talking to any human including my family so I'm completely alone and kinda broke, jobless, hopeless and depressed and I don't really know where or how to start. Anyone can help? BTW I can't go to therapy due to social anxiety and my financial issues.

"Hey just wanna talk i cant sleep and cant stop thinking about a class trip. 

Thanks in advance. "
"Hi! I've been overwhelmed by a lot of stuff lately. I've been seeing a therapist once a month and so far it's been helpful. But still i think it's nice to also hear some advice and perspectives from other people.

I get easily anxious and it worsened when my mom died just last year. Perhaps the reason why I'm particularly sad and overwhelmed right now is because they're also connected with my grieving process.

I've been struggling with my work these days. I started teaching almost a year and a half and this is the longest i've stayed in a job. I'd like to say that i enjoy teaching. I love the productive dynamics i have with my students. But it's the administrative work and some school politics that is slowly burning me out. Since i'm one of the youngest member in the faculty, most of the committee works assigned to me are those that involve a lot of coordination and being in the field. I like doing it since i also like the challenge but as time progresses it gets difficult and exhausting mentally, physically and emotionally. I'm the type of person who does my best and gives effort and attention to detail. So imagine having to do course preparations, lesson plan, trying to find ways to keep the class engaged and participative, and then after that component of my job i also have admin work as part of the faculty. It's exhausting to a point that i dread mondays. There are times wherein i feel sad or foolish whenever my class presentation is not well received by my students or how i evidently notice that they are bored, it makes me question if im doing it right etc. Sometimes it's just sad to reflect how there are times it makes me feel how being a teacher is a thankless job. I struggle with my mental health, but i have to set that aside since i have to be engaging and more extroverted in class. It drains my introvert self but i still do it because i like teaching and it makes me happy when students appreciate the lesson and be more critical thinkers, i also learn a lot from them. But yeah,sometimes i just feel that my effort is too much but the response from them is just so-so.

I've been applying to post grad scholarship cuz i still want to be part of the academe, but sadly i didnt get an offer to all the scholarship programs i applied to. And it's just heartbreaking. I guess all the pent up emotions and frustrations plus the grief of losing my mom are what driving me super sad and anxious right now. I cant really even fully explain what im feeling. Im bummed about the rejections and i want some comfort from the only person i wanna hug and hear right now but my mom is no longer here. These rejection letters have in a way affected my self-esteem. My boyfriend, friends and mentors would tell me how perhaps this isnt my time yet, that perhaps there are better opportunities, how this doesnt diminish my achievements or worth, i also know that. And i want to believe and i try to keep those in mind, but damn it's easier said than done.

Now i dread coming to class, but of course i cant just leave my students or diminishi my quality of teaching because of it. But yeah with all the admin work, course preps, it's making me more depressed. I feel sort of betrayed or unfairly treated by the universe. I do my best in everthing, i strive to be kind and empathetic, i value my students, but why do i continuously get losses and rejections. 

I moved away from home to start a career in teaching, i learned to love and appreciate my job, but in the end because i only get to go home every semestral breal since i relocated to a different city, i spent less time with my mom, and then she passed away. 

Now, i wanted to apply for post grad so i can effectively teach more and be a better educator,but then i couldnt get a program or scholarship. It's just sad thst in all my applications i never got even one scholarship offer. I believe i prepared my documents well and wrote a good essay. Ever since, im quite conscious and insecure about my writing skills, but with my essays for the application, i believe i put a lot of effort into them. So now i'm rather more insecure


Now im having an existential crisis :( i tried explaning this to my best friends and boyfriend but it's like i cant properly verbalize it and they cant understand me."

"Me and my ex broke up 3 weeks ago, but as friends who acknowledged that with time and change, we could give it a go again because we both agreed that we had something really special. 2 weeks ago, due to a misunderstanding and me fumbling and making the misunderstanding worse, she blocked me and told me firmly that we are never getting back together.  
I'm still so confused and lost. One of the biggest reasons we broke up was she felt she had lost her independence: we had tried going on a break before, but it didn't work because she could never stop herself from coming to me whenever she felt anything. So I don't know whether her saying that was truly due to what I did, or whether she needed a reason to hate me to stop herself from coming back to me. But I'm slowly coming to terms with the reality that no matter what, this means that it is the end. She doesn't want anything to do with me anytime soon, if ever.  
I'm not scared that she will find someone better than me. If she really does, then this breakup would have been the right thing. What I am scared of is that she won't find someone better, but will instead settle for someone who she will not feel the same way that I made her feel, because she will never consider me as a future partner again.  
I don't think there is any way to get her to see my side of the misunderstanding: any attempt at explaining myself would be met with further resistance. All I want from her is that if she ever does feel one day that there was no one better than me, to not let this misunderstanding stop her from considering me."

"So basically I(20f) got injured at work and have a concussion. My job put me on a hold until I give them a drug test, but I smoke weed to help me sleep and also with my PTSD. But I don't have a med card either. Anyways since I can't work at my one job, I'll only be working at one of my jobs. And I only make 11 bucks an hour there. And right now I usually pay 18-20 bucks a day back and forth to work with Uber because I currently don't have a license. 

And so my issue is, I pay 125 every week because it's easier to kinda save up money rather than paying 500 a month. I've been applying to tons of places, and I keep getting rejected, and my rent is coming up. I did let my roommates know the situation, but I'm still so anxious that I'm not good enough.

"I (36/F) am in grad school to get my MBA. On Friday I took a midterm for one of my classes, which I had studied extensively for, and felt that I understood the material well. When I opened the exam and reviewed some of the questions, I started to feel a sense of panic rising...  the calculations seemed to be far more complex than any of the practice questions or class materials we had learned and the way that several of the questions were worded was really confusing and convoluted. My anxiety started to spike and it started to feel like my brain was sabotaging me with this overwhelming sense of dread and hopelessness. I had these thoughts swirling through my head: ""I'm going to fail"" ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" ""There's no way I'm going to finish this on time,"" and I started to have a mini panic attack.  I started to feel hot, nauseous, and panicky like I needed to get out. I was able to calm myself enough to move on to some of the more straightforward questions but I still had this overwhelmingly negative feeling that it wasn't going well. My professor gave us 3 hours to complete the exam and assured us that we would not need the entire 3 hours to complete the exam ""if we studied all of the practice materials thoroughly"" (which I did). Well... I definitely took the entire 3 hours. To be honest, I don't even feel like my brain was functioning properly, I felt foggy and kept questioning myself on things I would normally be very confident. All in all, I ended the exam feeling terrible... like I had completely destroyed my entire graduate career. For context, I'm about halfway through my degree and have done very well so far. I have never failed an exam or any class and have a high GPA. But this class is part of the required curriculum and I must pass in order to move forward. I've been on a roller coaster of emotion all weekend, moving in between catastrophizing the situation and acceptance. I just need a kind voice, because my internal voice is not being very kind at the moment."

I understand that most of that problems are on me, i understand that i'm the only one who at fault, but i just don't know how to find energy on job, university and how i can to fulfill my dreams, i don't think they achiveable for me now and...I just tired of everything, i want just go to sleep and hope that i won't wake up anymore.  
  
Sorry for such negative post, i just can't afford psychologist for myself and i don't think that my father would give me money on him and would just say ""that's stupid, u just try to run away from your job""."
"hi! decided to neglect creating an anony account for this, but thanks to everyone involved here who's been generous with their time, patience, and insight with other people in this community.

been struggling with depression for a long time now. luckily, for the past two years i've been on medication that's helped me significantly, but it's also impacted me in other ways that haven't been so great.

however, recent events have flared it up to the point that medication feels like a short-term bandaid. for one, a few months ago me and my roommates had to search for a new place when our landlord terminated our tenancy prematurely (he intended to sell the place, and that's 100% legal where i'm at).

we powered through that within a few difficult months, but we managed to find a place nearby that, while smaller, is more accessible and ideal. the rent's also more expensive. it's a harsh truth of the current housing market so we just have to live with that.

but this week I've also handed in my resignation. my job is one that's paid me the best out of any job I've had, and its working hours are also the most flexible. it's also, at times, incredibly stressful and, most of the time, a thankless one. i did this without another job planned, and with only some money i currently earn from a freelance job. it's just reached a point where i can't will myself to be present there anymore. i can't adjust to their (frankly reasonable) demands for being in the office and attending specific meetings. it's the demands they've placed on me for the job that have made me crumble over time, and their terrible and thoughtless way of managing me and my colleagues.

tendering my resignation was the easiest decision I've made after sitting on it for a year, but the thought of what's next is not what's scaring me the most. it's the feeling i have that i'm utterly incapable of tackling it that's worsening how i feel now.

***i guess to sum it up***, i'd love to hear from people who've gone through moments of self-actualization and self-belief that have changed your life, but to have only hit harder obstacles on the way. i only say that because that describes my last 5 years or so, but any advice/sharing will be deeply appreciated.

it's a big challenge - and i don't intend on giving up on myself just yet - but right now nothing has provided me comfort and optimism to let me know i can move on and be a better person, professionally and personally. i love doing shit outside of work more than work itself, but even those little hobbies have been little help.

thank you for reading."
"Heya, just like the title says, I can't think or even figure out things that seem so easy. It may sound a bit cheesy, but I don't know who I am. I may be a bit on the younger side, but it's filling up in my head and I don't want to get help, since it might look like I seek attention. I don't try and get help from my friends because they tend not to take the things I say seriously. Well, that's because it's my fault for acting like a ""class clown"" in front of them, but I need help. At least, that's what I think.  


I think just a small talk would be okay."
I always struggle with anxiety on Sunday but today its off the charts. I have an intense week coming up at work and I don't feel prepared. I'm trying to tell myself I just need to survive the week but I can't stop the spiral
"work for a country club, at the restaurant. Most of the employees are like 6-10 years younger than I. I am a runner/expo after being promoted from just a busser. Anyways it seems they prefer young people to be servers and still its not money. I'm looking for another job because the money is not that great. 

Meanwhile most of the people there are friends including one of the managers. They hang out after work, drinking together, doing things together. It feels like HS where I was bulied and I was an outcast. One of the servers told me something racist and she got away since she is friends with the one manager. That one girl is like one of the mains in the clique group so after that happened, some people stopped talking to me. I never get invited to drink with them after and even with new hires, they get befriended and do stuff. Most of the times I have to run food by myself for 10 people because the servers are somewhere chatting with each other. They usually go in the back with either chat or use their phone. 



Last week the bartender who is one of the oldest people there (like 40s) had a birthday party and of course I was not invited. I don't know but makes me feel awful and depressed. And plus overworked."
"Although, there’s some truth to that. It’s tough to say, that’s exactly… what we needed at the moment when we are in our most vulnerable. It probably varies from person to person. Or the intensity and type of circumstances. But these words… a little difficult to be able tell, when it’s the most appropriate to say them. Or to even say it at all. Cos if it was that simple. Everyone and anyone would be able to do it."
"I've lost faith in a kind God.   

I've been totally worn down by two people who turned to me for support.    One is suicidal.    I can't take being told that anymore because it's repeated a lot when we talk, and ive really tried to help but they still say it, sometimes just after smiling at something going well.

Something else has happened to me and I can't post here, but it's really difficult.

I used to think I had friends, but I've realised that they weren't genuine.

My physical health isn't good.

I don't think I have anyone to turn to, and yet I'm near people who would call themselves supportive but they share information. 

I have no idea what's next.

"Hi, I know you might be going through some difficult times, and I am ready to lend an ear (please keep it respectful). Feel free to DM!"
"I dont know what’s wrong with me 

Yesterday I went to a party with my friend friends, the night went ok, we didn’t really do something fun or anything. But the thing is when I wanted to go home alone ( waking like an hour )with my music in my ears how I usually like to do, they didn’t want me to leave alone or whiteout something to pay the bus. And which I understand it’s super nice dont  get me wrong, but i kept refusing and letting it do my way, and firstly I felt so bad having them using their time trying to convince me so I ended up agreeing. But it felt like they did it because they pitied me or like they were obligated to do it. 
But the worst part is the boy I was trying so hard to forget about, just asked me why i kept refusing their help, and I couldn’t help but reply to him and he listened, when  I usually feel like he doesn’t care( and he doesn’t I really don’t know what that was about) 
I just couldn’t accept their help and when we parted ways half way I couldn’t stop crying on my way back thinking how they’re surely shit talking me for how weak I am. I cried the whole day and couldn’t get out of bed, I even threw up two Times. I can’t sleep too.

I don’t know if it’s comprehensive, and I’m sorry for my bad English. There is so much about this night that I cant remember not because I was drunk or anything but my brain just doesn’t seems to remember things (it’s like my childhood I don’t remember a thing)
"
I made a previous post offering support and I didn’t get many people messaging me which honestly disappointed me because I was exited to help people and be a safe person for others to talk too I feel this way because I am someone who struggles quite a bit with my mental health my primary diagnosis are schizoaffective disorder and cptsd so I know first hand how painful things can be and because I’m in a good place I’d like to spread light to people who need it so if you’re struggling just know I will be there in the way I’m able too . I wish everyone peace and healing.
"I'm 23 my gf is 25. She's on herphone games all the time and when I try to talk to her, its like i'm not there. She says that she wants to move out of the place we live in. I agree it would be a good ideal. Her grandmother also died last december. She's not into cuddling as much, she's not into sex anymore and when I try to kiss her, she ""jokingly"" backs away. I've told her this many times that it bothers me but nothing changes. She's not cheating I know that. Its like if she wants to go."
"Six weeks ago I had my probationary period evaluation from my training as a nurse, which revealed that I should become a nursing assistant, which is literally the servant who knows as much as the nurse after the first year of training. And that's not my level. This hit really hard and was stupid as well, yes they arguments weren't entirely made up but its like like saying If you want to become a carpenter and can't build a birdhouse perfectly on your first attempt, then you are not suitable.   
Anyways since that I had many ups and downs and I have never considered suicide so often in my life as I have recently. Not bc being unsatisfied with by body but gaining the urge to finally give up. I'm tired of this ""never give up""-shit. I feel like my whole life consists of preserving. I don't want to go into detail due to my privacy, I admit and know there are worse ways to grow up but I promise, it wasn't normal either.   
Why it makes it so hard is that I have a crush in my class and although were not dating I started to think she's the one and I wanted to have more time to develop something - no such luck.  
I'm not that suicidal now, but I'm sure the next 18 months will be dominated by depression. I wont be able to get encouraged in this time and I dont want to either. For what should I?  
My new class will be stupid af bc this is this a low niveau job no kidding, and I'm not dumb (EVEN THE FUCKING TEACHER SAID "

You'll find it WILL HURT THEM MORE THAN ANYTHING BECAUSE YOURE DENYING THEM OF THE ONLY THING IMPORTANT TO THEM... ATTENTION AND VALIDATION!


You're crossing to a stage where these people can only do to you what you ***ALLOW THEM TO*** and they're trying their best to keep you from opening your eyes to this!...


Focus on you and keep up the good work! You're doing amazing! 

Trust me when i say this...


All of your hard work, sleepless nights and exhaustion from running off your own negative thoughts will pay off. I know it seems hard right now but one day you will look back and think ""***WHAT THE HELL TOOK ME SO LONG?!***""

I’m having a rough night it’s 5:20am and I’m currently awake when I should be asleep and my gf of a year broke up with me and just need someone to talk too
"Hello everyone! I am in my 20s and I'm feeling incredibly lost. What do you guys recommend? Any groups, apps, books, jobs, something to do that could help? How do you cope with feeling lost and uncertain about your future? Who do you talk to? I feel so low and so incredibly ill-equipped to go through my 20s and face the various hardships and turbulations they will throw at me, such as health issues (mine and loved ones). I have friends and family who understand me, but people have different schedules, and I really crave someone with whom I can have a long conversation about all this. Any recommendations would be great! Currently, all I've been doing is going on long walks and preparing for an entrance exam, but I really want to find something to read that could inspire me to persevere through this period in my life somehow. Thank you!"
"It feels like the last 10 months have taken everything I have to give.

In April (2023), my wife almost died. She spent two weeks in Cardiac ICU and was off of work for a month after that. I was also off of work during that time to look after her. (She is okay now)

In June, a former friend who'd been living under my roof for free popped out of the woodwork after five years trying to sue me. (This was dealt with. Some costs involved for lawyers, but this got dealt with)

In August, my entire city was evacuated due to wildfires. I left August 16th and didn't return home until September 25th. Extremely high stress period, worried about looting, things burning down etc.

Nov, my mother's health took a huge dive.

This month: One of the places I work at a remote diamond mine in the Canadian Arctic. A few days ago one of the planes shuttling work crews in and out -- and I ride on these -- went down and killed 8 people, 2 of which I knew.

Now my wife's father is dying. He is ... lingering. It is not a situation that is going to be reversed. He is unconscious but still in pain and my wife has spent all of her time at his side. She is naturally extremely upset and stressed and it is being passed on to me -- of which I take willingly.

I'm having a hard time being there for my wife. She's been at her father's side for .... 13 days now. 13 days since all fluids and care were discontinued. 100% of her time is being spent at the hospital. I'm still working, but she isn't.

I'm not worried about the financial side of it, we'll be okay there. I just ... I feel like I've lost my ability to be sympathetic, and that wounds me deeply. She is going through absolute hell, and I feel like I'm being there for her physically only. I'm listening and doing the things I should... but it feels hollow.

Interspace the trials and tribulations of work -- stressors major and minor.

I build electronics for a hobby -- this is my primary outlet. I realized I haven't built a thing since April. I am not hanging out with my friends anymore. I don't seem to enjoy anything.

I want to hang out with people but I just don't know what to say that doesn't feel hollow and stupid. So I make excuses to not hang out.

I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, or any solution other than I have to keep holding up everyone else around me.

I'm exhausted all of the time, but I don't sleep at night. I live in a remote place so I don't really have access to good therapy. I'm not in any danger of self harm or anything like that, but I just... I'm struggling so hard to get out of bed and put a brave face on and get things done.

Worse, I'm in a management role at work so I have to keep things buried. One of my guys is being extremely trying -- showing up constantly late, not doing his documentation etc, and one day I'm just going to completely lose it at him.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't take time off because my wife has missed so much. I didn't get paid for the month and a half we were away from the fires and neither did my wife. We're OK... but I can't willy nilly take time off right now.

I just don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;"
"Its been years since I posted on here, but back then I got a lot of help and even met my former best friend on here, so maybe it will help me again.
I always was a lonely person, I don't have any friends and I only have 1 person very important to me in life. For a long time I was happy because of that person, but recently we have been fighting and it makes me sad. I am sure we will make up again, but life feels hard currently. 
Especially because I don't have friends, fights make me very lonely and sad.
I would be happy if some people would listen to me and give me some advice."
"Hello everyone, 2024 already isn't going well for me and just need to get it off my chest. 

I (31m) have been feeling extremely out of sorts for the past couple of weeks. My birthday is coming up and I feel stagnant in my life and I know I'm not where I want to be and am constantly feeling like time is running out.

Health has always been a difficult one for me, all my life I have fluctuated with my weight- I don't like how I look, so I buy a gym membership and work out. Then either plateau or get into a depressed funk and throw in the towel and buy take aways and eat junk. I'm once again on the up and up and try to walk at least 3 hours a day. I still feel gross about myself and even bought 'sliming vests' to wear whenever going out to meet friends.

I have a freelance job, which I really love. It is well paid and the people there are great. I was employed last year in October and was so emotional at Christmas because it was the first time in A LONG time that I could treat myself and not have the stress of worrying if I was able to eat that week. (side note; Lidl bakery sections are a life saver for struggling workers). But in the last few weeks, there have been meetings and contract changes. The company has now employed 20ish new people to replace people like me (and for less money... barely above minimum wage). My boss has stated that the new workers wont affect my work hours... but going from 35hrs a week to 12 shows how much b.s. they talk. So because of this, I am back to the grind of searching for jobs every day to get by. 

Even though this job is great for me, its not what I want to do forever. Since I was little, I have dreamt of being an actor. I trained at drama school and have been auditioning/ putting myself out there, all that stuff and I'm back to where I started but with the addition of student loans. (And I know that only 2% of people 'make it' as an actor) and that's okay. I just want to be able to entertain people on stage and live comfortably. But I'm back to auditioning for my local voluntary am- dram group which has kicked my confidence a bit. Plus starting this late to train/ being a lot older than the young actors coming out of drama schools really feels like there is a time limit on achieving my dreams.

And finally, the relationship side of my life... is pretty non existent. I have 2 really close friends which I love whole heartedly. But my family relationship is very messy- My mum passed away 7 years ago. And not only do I miss her every day, but the absence of unconditional love in my life, I really struggle with. Due to my financial conditions, I live with/ care for my abusive, alcoholic dad, who constantly reminds me that I shouldn't be acting and that I am a burden. (I am trying to save up to move out and never have to see him again... but the process is slow). I do have a sister, who I wish I was closer with, but she 'escaped' the mess that is my family years ago. She has a husband and two lovely children and I couldn't be more happy for her. But I have to admit, looking at her life makes me pity mine, which brings me onto my other relationships...

I don't have a partner (and don't worry r/KindVoice, this isn't me looking for one). I have had a few in the past and the majority of them have been quite abusive. What with cheating and physical violence, but that's another story for another time. I don't hide myself away from people (quite the opposite), but I'm also not an 'aggressively forward' flirt. I know I'm an affectionate person (I fall in love about 3 times on the train). And there are people I interact with at work/ rehearsals that I would love to progress things further, but they show no signs of reciprocation and I don't want things to be awkward/ make them feel uncomfortable. And once again, I feel like I am running out of time- I would love to meet someone and eventually start a family.

Thank you for reading this, I don't expect replies or anything. And if one person in a similar situation sees this, then just know you're not alone :)"
"Everything i do, going out, a date, playing with friends, i am losing interest in all of that, i just dont know if i have a mental problem ik, im just geting tired quickly, things that i love to do i dont like anymore"
i’ve been crying for the past 5 hours non stop and i have no idea how to stop
I’m trying to make new friends but it’s a struggle and I don’t know why. Is it horns to be in between friends at school? And does it get better?
recently my grandma passed away and my family is still in mourning. And I thought(I’m a catholic who goes to church) I can have my grandma in like an intention so like the mass would be intended for my grandmother. I email whoever is in charge and they say sure they’ll do it but it’s $10 dollar. I don’t mind at all paying it’s just how do I get the money to them? I don’t have a bank account so I can’t do PayPal or anything but I can mail. It’s just how do I mail it without my family noticing the little flag that’s up when I need mail sent. Idk if this is relevant to this group but I’m desperate. Please. Thanks.
My parents hasn’t been supportive of me mentally and emotionally.. and I feel like I’m missing something out and there few things I like to hear
"For better or worse, I grew up in a fucked up society in a Third World country where women are mistreated day in and day out. I left, I don't live there anymore. I moved to a first world country. 

It marked me, however, and these days I have trouble being intimate with women. I'm just very very careful with not wanting to make someone uncomfortable. I don't like crossing people's boundaries, especially women's.

I just never ever want to be like or be perceived like any of those men that I saw doing those things. 

First off, I know I'm not like them. I know that there is no way on Earth that I'd ever do that. Second, my therapist, has told me, time and again, that I'm not like that and that I should not fear being intimate with someone because of it. Third, I have a lot of female friends, and they all trust me. They trust me so much that they'll sleep over at my place. 

Even then, I have a hard time ""making a move"" or ""going for it"" or whatever. Like for instance, last Saturday I was on a date, we went past the touch barrier but I only ever touched her shoulders. She kept touching my thighs though. Nothing really happened, but maybe something could have. I don't know. 

I just don't know when it's alright and when it's not alright, and what I can do, when to stop and so on. 

I mean, maybe it sounds dumb but I need reassurance, or at least someone to hear me out and explain things to me. 

I feel like I don't know anything, and that I should have figured this out a while ago. "
"If you don't have anyone to talk to, or even if you have people to talk to but don't quite feel like those conversations were very productive, then feel free to dm any time. Open to chatting about whatever is on your mind and bothering you."
I 23M lead on a really sweet 21F. The first time I lead her on she understood that I couldn’t figure out my feelings. I lead her on again however and completely severed our trust when I just couldn’t commit again. I told her I was completely selfish for it and that I’m an immature person who just can’t sort through my feelings. She said we most likely can’t be friends anymore - which I understand completely. I am very ashamed that I’ve hurt this girl so much emotionally. All I can do is move forward but I truly feel disgusted with myself.
"Hey guys 
So here is the deal, my father is kind of violent, verbally and sometimes i get choked. It’s rare tho, but his reactions are often very aggressive, and i know it sounds grave but for me it’s not ( I really don’t know how to explain ). Sometimes I get really scared to tell him things, but i don’t seem to react really to his behavior and I don’t remember smaller me reacting (i have very bad memory). But sometime he tells me, for example that when he thinks about work he gets extremely angry, and just want to beat up everyone, and tbh I don’t know what to say to this. I did notice my behavior as well, getting closer to my dads one. Like getting really angry for no reason and just begin to slap my poor little sibling. I love my dad I really do, he can be so sweet. But I guess, when I’m thinking about it, he doesn’t really much affection, most of the time, I’m the one to go hug him first, he never says I love you first. The worst part is, that he clearly like better my little sister, even my big sister can see it, I don’t think I’m imagining it. Sometimes I really wonder if he really knows me at all, I don’t know him and that’s really how it is. He tells me that I think I’m the persecuted person in the family and I should stop being so drama queen or whatever, but you know what maybe i am. 

I don’t talk much I prefer much more to listen so people easily forget that I’m here, or don’t pay much attention to me. I never ask for anything but when i do, then I’m the greedy one and the spoiled child. I guess that maybe I am. It’s hard for me to tell people what I feel cause I can’t find the words. 

My mom isn’t bipolar but she change emotions very often. It’s very hard for me to keep up. She often yells at me for something, it can be anything. There isn’t a single peaceful day without being yelled at. She has a very painful back, so painful, that sometimes it’s hard for her to walk and because (as what she told me) that I don’t do much ( i try I really do ) that’s I’m a selfish child who doesn’t care about her.  Which is completely untrue I love her very much i feel like she is one of the only person in my life who understands me (sometimes). My mom suffers from a lot of stress so it’s not easy for no one everyday. 

 My parents are separated so I need to be the messenger, and again, I’m the one being yelled at for something my one parent say that didn’t please my other. And because my father doesn’t respond often to my mother she gets annoyed, so me and my little sister obviously have to pay the price.

I forced a small smile and said hi but I quickly left cause her boyfriend was near and deep down I knew I would’ve felt even worse than I do now if I would’ve talked with her longer and caught up. She didn’t want me and all the failure and hurt flashed rapidly before me and she’s just one of those girls to me that I just can’t bear to be friends with after falling for her and it’s for the best.

"Time to die

Another reason to die.

Seeing homeless and orphans dying under a bridge. Another reason to die.

Being molested and abused. Another reason to die.

Cars trying to run over and kill a child. Another reason to die.

People lying that it gets better when it doesn't. Another reason to die.

Having no money for rent, for clothes, for food, being left and kicked out to the streets.
Another reason to die.

Hatred for the poor, the marginalized, the ostracized, the disenfranchised. Another reason to die.

I sometimes wonder why in place of mercy and love we use mercy called hatred and love called venom. Possessive love, that kills instead of helps. And this world calls it mercy.

I don't agree or belong here. I need to die. I tried everything. I have seen everything. I have done everything. 

Corpses don't lie. Corpses don't molest. Corpses don't feast and induce and introduce raw visceral torment. A reflection in the mirror, shattered, seeing a shattered reflection, window pieces piercing my face. Words of hatred on my face.

Don't worry it's all fine. After all, eventually we all run out of time. I am gonna die tomorrow! I am so happy. It means this alien in an alien world can go to their true home. This home was never my home. Tears in rain don't remember this pain."
"I've been struggling really badly lately and decided to get rid of some of that energy by talking to others who are going through their own dark days.

Even if someone can't say that they know 100 % of what you're going through I can promise you that someone out there can still understand the feeling of the pain you feel. I went through the same thing and those small moments where someone was kind to me helped get me through another day. Just one more day meant a week, or a month, until I was able to find my own long term reason to stick around on this planet.

"My girlfriend came to me today saying that she wanted 3 days to herself to figure out her feelings. Not her feelings about me or anything but her feelings in general because she's been kind of unstable recently when it comes to her mental health. I asked her for a bit of details and she told me that she had been feeling this way for a few days, wanted to take these days to find a path to feeling being mentally stable, and wanted to find a way to prioritize herself more. She said that she wanted to prioritize herself more because sometimes despite not being in the mood she would do something like call with me or text me when she wasn't really in the mood for it. She said that she is doing this for her and for our relationship, and that she wants to be stable for her and for our relationship. She has also said that she does NOT want to break up and that breaking up is not on her mind at all.  I agree with all of these things and I am fully in support of her taking these days if it means that she will feel better and be more stable for herself and for us.

I want her to do this and I am happy she is doing this for us and that she is taking these steps to improve her mental health. This whole thing just sets off a lot of my anxiety because this kind of thing has happened in most of my prior relationships and ended in my relationship being over. I feel anxious about this despite my girlfriend never lying to me about anything and I feel this way despite knowing that she loves me just as much as I love her. How do you all deal with anxiety that you feel you shouldn't be feeling? It's been something I have struggled with for a long time and you kind people seem to always find a way to help people who are feeling low."

A few weeks ago she'd managed to get him to move to another room but lately he's been pushing and trying to go back into her room. Every time I see him there my heart breaks. He's killing her slowly and myself as well. We don't have the means to move out right now. 

Can someone please tell me this isnt forever? I feel so miserable and defeated."

"Hello.

This post might be a bit long but I would truly appreciate it if someone would comment. I usually get ghosted some I'm hoping that's not the situation here. Thank you! Really sorry for the long post but I have to get this off my mind somehow.

**What Happened:**

Honestly not even sure what to say. I'm just feeling really lonely and lost right now. I'm a student going to university and I feel like I'm a fraud doing my degree sometimes because the professors aren't the best in my department so I feel like I'm learning nothing. Having this feeling makes me scared to apply for jobs. I'm afraid I won't land a job before graduation and I really don't want to be sitting around post-grad with nothing waiting on interviews. 

On top of that a few months ago I had a pretty big argument with one of my closest friends. So not really being friends with him or his brother anymore is striking me. We have a pretty big circle of friends but I was truly the closest to him but I feel kinda betrayed after what happened. We were so close that I would give free rides to him whenever we both needed to be at the same place so I think it hit me really hard. I was really close to their family and thought of them as my own. I bought him an iPad for his graduation recently. I loved being his friend. Usually, I don't struggle with emotion like this but it's made me more depressed than it should have.

Both of these guys had always had a tendency to listen to everything their dad said which did bother me at times but I usually understood it considering their situation. Whenever we wanted to eat out they were picky, if we wanted to do something they had to confirm with their dad, as an example him being 21 and having his Nintendo taken away because he was playing too many games was a bit weird but again I didn't think much of it. We always played Fortnite during the summer pretty much all day so I can see how it was annoying that he wasn't actually doing something useful regardless of if he had graduated.

To quickly give some context, over the summer we had a plan for one weekend, 10 people were coming to my house for a party and the next day we would go to the movies. Only 3 people came to my place which made me upset. My closest friend wasn't able to come because his dad sent him on a trip which I understood at first but I was hoping his brother would come considering he was in town. I asked him the night before and he said I can't because ""my dad said so"". Obviously, since I was notably upset I was ghosting everyone. and after he said ""My dad said so"" I just left him on read.

The next day he called me an hour before the movie and I ghosted him. I felt like his brother was only calling around that time because he was looking for a free ride. At the movies, he got a ride from his dad. We didn't say anything to me and I didn't say anything back. I was lowkey expecting an apology but I wasn't shocked because my friend's brother never apologized. Sometimes even in dire situations when it's been his fault I've never seen him apologize. 

My friend while on the trip would message me asking for forgiveness and I wasn't so easy on him this time because he's done this before. Either he doesn't like to come or his family gets in his way so I was a little hesitant about wanting to forgive. Without going into too much detail we said some things to each other. Despite still being annoyed at him we sort of left it with me saying ""I will forgive but not forget"". Things were still heated. I said to him how I was pissed at his brother and that he was ""cocky/prideful"" which I think he got pretty upset at. He did mention his dad in the conversation we had a few times. He messaged saying he would talk to his brother when he came back.

The day he came back I approached him and he was really mad at me. He said his brother is mad at me because ""I left him on read and didn't answer his call"". I was really confused and annoyed as to how I was suddenly the guy in the wrong when I had a right to be upset at how the situation turned out for me. I invite my friends to my house and nobody shows up, apparently, it's not a big deal so how dare you get mad. Also, I had told my friend 2 weeks before everyone else about the party/movie but he didn't tell his family so he and his brother couldn't come because their dad didn't know about it in advance. It was his fault clearly. The entire mess was my friend's fault but because of him his brother and I were on bad terms.

Regardless I decided to drop it and apologize the same night. The only reply I get is ""It's ok, I have to go"" followed by in front of me both leaving with some of our other friends. Felt so pathetic in that moment, I felt like I had no self-worth. I'm not even worth enough to be listened to. The guy that you made upset is coming himself to apologize but still, that isn't enough. 

I give them space but message over text to emphasize that I truly was apologetic. The same thing, ""It's ok"". A few days later I show up but they immediately leave. I apologized to their dad after running into him thinking that maybe I upset him because that's the impression I was left with. He told me ""It's ok but we should watch what we say"". I got the impression that he was mad at me. That day was so rough, I went home and shed a few tears cause I was really mad at how everything was turning out. I left a voice message apologizing again. Both said, ""It's ok, we're sorry too, time will tell"". This was August..

I've seen both of them in person a few times at different events but we haven't really spoken to each other. We just uttered a few words and that's pretty much it. I don't really mind not being friends with them anymore. The month of September was a bit annoying to get through because I stopped showing up wherever they were so being alone was tough. I did a lot of things with these guys. My family helped me get through it, I spent a lot of time with my brothers playing video games or going out with family. It was nice but since the days are shorter now and school has been going on for some time now it's been a little overwhelming because it feels like you're all alone. During this time I like to rely on friends but since I'm not really close to a friend like that anymore and because of this situation I've been a little stressed out.

**How I'm Feeling:**

I've always felt weird around his brother. It might even be a little bit of jealousy. I've always felt pathetic around him because he's jacked while I'm not. He seemed perfect in every way and everyone preferred him whenever we would play ball or something else. It got in my head but since we were friends I didn't care too much. In fact, I don't even like hanging around with any of our circle because everyone has their own mini-groups. A lot of them are also really toxic and competitive which isn't in my nature, the only reason why I was playing around with these people is because we all live in the same neighborhood so we see each other all the time and my closest friend was a little quiet like me so I enjoyed his company. I didn't mind being around everyone as long as he was there. It was so obvious that people were shocked and poked at how I only came if he came. During this period of time that I've been struggling with this, I've been going through many emotions. 

At first, it was a little hard but after practically begging them to forgive me hoping that it would be the same I realized that I had to stop and have some self-respect. My goal was to never cut ties or anything but to realize how I was being a little misused in our friendship. I feel okay but every now and then I have these annoyances of constantly thinking about what happened, if it was my fault or their fault, or if things could have been different. I don't want to think about it anymore. A few weeks after what happened I remember that I was so disturbed by this with the feeling of betrayal that whenever I did something wrong I remembered ""did ""brother's name"" do this?"". He's so perfect that I have to be like him. This sounds weird but it's like he's controlling everything I do, I had to be better than him so every single thing I did was because of him. Every time I've thought about this or felt pathetic about how I begged someone without self-respect to forgive me and was treated like a dog my mom has helped me but I can't keep going back to her. It must get annoying. 

I was doing fine for so long but it's just that recently I started to remember all of it again. The stress of school which is normal for a student has made this entire feeling a bit more overwhelming. I feel lonely and it seems tough to get through it. I think what triggered these thoughts is playing the new season of Fortnite. It has made me remember many of our good memories from when we played the game earlier in the year. We used to play a lot with each other, just recently I logged on and saw that he had unfriended me from the game which hurt a lot for some reason. You know we texted a lot, just brothers living life doing stuff together having fun so getting the blame for something that isn't really my fault hurts. I don't know why I keep remembering what happened and I want to get it out of my head. I've tried so many things and watched so many videos that talk about how friendships come and go. I just wish I was able to explain what my situation was or maybe if he understood it. I was so mad that I went on a rampage deleting all pics I had of them on my phone regardless of what it was from. I still have the messages from all my apologies but I'm thinking of deleting those too now.

Thinking about constantly is not letting me focus on school, I haven't really been eating too much, and haven't been hitting the gym like I've wanted to. It's sort of dragging me down. I can't truly avoid them either because our group of friends is quite large so I'm bound to run into them some time and I feel like when I see either one of them it'll make me mad or think about it more. I need help man, I wanna forget and move on. I'm not even mad at what happened anymore, if they wanna distance themselves they can. I gave a lot of my friendship to em and I didn't get enough of it back. I have other friends but for some reason, I'm finding myself feeling guilty hanging out with them. I'm not sure why. I feel like they'll also betray me. It's so bad sometimes that if I message someone and they don't reply to me or leave me on read I immediately start getting negative thoughts about that person.

Sometimes I start questioning myself and how maybe I was the toxic friend. I can see how I was aggressive sometimes and was aggressive over what happened but I didn't think it needed to get this bad. I didn't want to lose my friend. I can't reach out to them either because my parents advised me not to do so. I also want to listen to their advice. If I apologized to his parents he should have done the same to mine because my parents were also reasonably upset with how he handled the situation and treated me. I'm not even sure if I'm mad at them, disappointed, or if I want to seek revenge. I feel like the feeling of hatred comes and goes. To be honest I don't even want to live in the area I'm living in anymore and plan on moving after I get a job.

I keep thinking about the summer, even though it's far away. I don't have much to do in the summer so I feel like I have to go out and play sports if everyone else is and if they're there I feel like I can't because the same thing might happen. That's why I want to grab a job before graduating so I'm busy with my own life and don't have to deal with people but that seems impossible.

Just a lot going on right now and I don't know man, I just don't wanna be depressed. I feel like I even missed some of the stuff I wanted to mention here. I've always felt lonely, and never truly had a friend expect him. We became closer around 2018 and though I understand that friends come and go it's hard to make the mind understand that. You remember the good memories but then immediately remember the bad memories. Even though we're all on good terms now and have seen each other a few times with minimal conversation I still feel as if they're mad at me. I know they aren't but why do I keep thinking about it. I'm scared that if I show up to an event they'll leave because of me which is something I don't want to face again.

I've been as far as even considering seeing a therapist but it's a bit expensive. I want to just chat with someone personally but everyone I've tried to do that with online leaves mid-conversation. Though the post is long, I have nowhere else to really go.

Can anyone guide me through this or tell me what I should do? How can I stop thinking about this? What are some methods to block out a few thoughts? If I see them in person how can I control my thoughts and emotions? I'm honestly so lost right now, this might even sound dramatic but I've never really been through anything like this so I'm finding it a bit hard to manage my emotions. I've noticed that I am a sensitive person when it comes to my emotions. I want to become a better person, I want to learn from this and move on."
"That sounds kinda sad lol, but it would mean a lot. I am very sad recently. Anything convenient "
"Just as the title says, life has led me down some winding and honestly dark places lately. I used to live in Richmond where there was a thriving LGBTQ+ community that I felt at home in, and now live in rural virginia. I have hardly any friends and I feel so alone and scared out here (recent events don’t help). I’m 23 he/him if that matters, my messages are open to all though :)))"
"I've been telling people about this boy who's been harassing me. And following me. And saying sexual things. And none of them believed me because ""You're not pretty enough for him to think that.""

Except for my one professor, who promised me she'd believe me. ""I can't report it without evidence but I believe you."" That made my heart so full, until one day he wouldn't leave me alone from her class and I was afraid to walk back to my dorm alone with him so I said to her ""Please help me stall"" and she hid me in her office for half an hour until he stopped lingering at the door.

I thought she believed me. She had all the evidence, didn't she? Until today when she said ""You're overthinking it, maybe he was just waiting to ask me a question."" He wasn't though because I asked ""Are you waiting to ask her a question?"" and he said no. ""Are you waiting for me?"" Yes.

Why doesn't she believe me anymore? She was the one person I trusted the most."
"I'm middle aged so I might not have long to live anyway.     I feel incredibly low.    Had awful relatives, who've sided with abusive stepparent.

Pretty much most of my life has been a complete waste.     "
"2 years ago my older brother of 44 years cheated on his wife with 2 children for 3 years and went to live with me my mom and my second older brother, and he got us evicted form the house we lived in. He is oppressive, overly prideful, doesn't help with nothing and harassed us for 6 months.
Now after harassing the upstairs neighbors, our landlord told us that we had to leave the house, we where there for only year and an half.
My diabetic mother immediately started to look for a new house but couldn't find one for weeks. We eventually found one, we paid 2 month of rent to getting in the house, using money we didn't have. The new landlords are a nice old couple and I became the responsible for the once, signed the contract and am the one that's sends the money to pay the rent.
My older brother went to live with a woman he was dating, but now after just 3 months the woman breaks up with him, now he wants to come live with us again until he gets another place (he says).
But I don't wanna let him in, i am the responsible of the house so I got the say in this but my mother and brother (who where completely furious with him) now are against me. He come to the house today saying that he is change, that he knows he was wrong, just that was enough to make my mother and brother take pity on him and make me look like tha villain.
Now I'm in my room trying not to cry after standing up for us 3, while they stood against me and left to go get food. 
I'm the youngest of the family, I am 22, my mother is 64, my second brother is 33 and my oldest brother is 44, and I am the one who is standing up to make sure we get to stay in this house for more then year and an half.

I won't succumb, I won't go through all of that again, don't care if he is change or not.

I come here to ask for words of encouragement since it looks like am alone.

"I am in my 30s. Not young. I never had any actual relationships. Only one, was mostly long distance and after being together in person he left to go to a new college and met other people there. Left me behind. I tried to date others. They tried to have sex with me, even tried to assault me. Refused/had to physically fight some. 

I tried apps. Most are catfishers from different countries pretending to live here. I met ine attractive guy on the app and added me on social media but he lives in Europe. We had some decent conversations but guess what, he randomly tells me how he is horny and sends an unsolicited picture.

I go to events, I work events, I go the gym. Guys talk to me and then they end up mentioning a gf. Or they even banter and that gives me false hope and then I get hurt. I live in Los Angeles and I do a lot of catering events or attend film festivals. 

I honestly thought my boss from my regular job liked me, he kept teasing me and saying flirting things and he is a single guy and I am gonna leave the job. But nope, today he flipped completely amd and didn't even tell me hi and was nice to my coworkers. Tried to tell me something random but I ignored him.

So what's wrong with me?"
"i (16F) think i experienced a trigger a few days ago and i can’t get it out of my head. i know im kinda young for this app but i needed somewhere to get this out that isn’t mainstream like tiktok or instagram. when i was 14 years old, i was at an art camp, and i had a friend who was the son of my favorite art teacher. He (18M at the time), had always been kind to me and i’d known him since i was in 7th grade, as he was an assistant director for a lot of my school plays i was in (same school his mom worked at, he was close with the theatre teacher). for background, this wasn’t the first weird thing. In 8th grade, i was the lead in the play, and while trying to demonstrate how he wanted me to be lifted in the finale, he scooped me up by putting his head against my chest and pushing me over into his arms, bridal-style. it surprised me, but he was my friend, so whatever, right? few months later at this art camp, he and i were joking around sitting in the back of the auditorium and he was teasing me that i was colorblind (i’m not actually, it was a running inside joke for us) and he started pointing at random stuff in the large room asking me what color it was. then he asks, “what color is this?” and brushes his fingertips over my chest closest to him and basically caresses it. i was confused, and he never broke eye contact with me, never faltered his smile, never blinked. i answered “maroon” and he waited another moment then withdrew his hand. I was distracted the rest of the day. it wasn’t until i was laying in bed that night that it fully registered with me. i had to see him the next few days and it was agonizing, and him being an intern at the camp, he nominated me for an award in the theatre division of the arts camp the next day. i never told anyone for over a year. in that time, i saw him 3 times. i just got in my first relationship with my bf (16M) 6 months ago, and recently was able to open up to him about it. he was horrified i had kept it to myself for as long as i did, and asked how i was so calm. truthfully, ive had some bad experiences with guys in high school, even getting stalked in freshman year by a sophomore. ever since that incident, when i realized men can just DO that (touch you without consent, it was the first but not last time it happened and it hit hard) i tensed at hugs from guy friends. i didn’t mean to, but any time any guy showed any interest in me, my mental alarm bells went off and i couldn’t be relaxed. i hated being alone with guys i didn’t know well. my bf, however, is so kind and patient and understanding, and thinks that when we turn 18 i should get myself therapy once i am financially able for all the experiences i had. i’m posting this because a few days ago his face was at the top of my instagram feed because my theatre teacher from middle school (who i now follow) posted a picture with him in it. out of no where, i felt that horrible clammy feeling. there were other weird small things he did, but none big enough for me to mention here other than the first two. i’m not sure if i’m asking for advice or just venting, but i don’t know if there’s something wrong with me, if i should let my bf help me research getting therapy one day, or what."
"So, I have been with the most amazing soul I've ever met for the past 6 years. We met and it was an instant love at first sight, which for me is incredibly rare since I'm demi romantic/demisexual. It was an amazing 6 years together and we ended up getting engaged 2 years ago. 
However life has us moving down different paths now and as of Friday she has asked for a separation. 

I am in turmoil, and my heart and mind are devastated. As it is I already struggle and fight anxiety and panic attacks, but this has pushed my overactive mind into overdrive and I'm having a hard time not worrying or crying. 

I'm looking for some new friends to play PC games with and talk to on discord.  Building a bit of a support network or distraction network I suppose. 

Please be 18+ though. I am 35.

All this is breaking me, the children and our little family.
But i am the only one who.sees it this way.
We meet every 6 months with Jugendamt here in germany like child services , i dont know if it is similar.
They provide us a helping person who comes to visit us and talks with us and in this.meeting we talk.
But it is always frustrating for me.
On thursday they said that they are happy how far we vave come, that back then there was no way anyone would agree to anything and that we were just mad at each other.
I said that i disagree hard because my ex only offered to keep it the way that i see my son from every 2nd friday to sunday and there was no talk about it getting more.
Yes i had no say in it, everyone said he can do it and i had to go to court 2 times, it is a long story , i was not a bad mother or anything, i had the twins 24/7 and he pnly took them for 4 hours a week until like 2 montghs ago.
So yeah i said there was no way i could agree because there was nothing to agree on.
I get so mad that they try to frame it like that, i got abzsed and i still am traumatized and they act like i was part of the problem.
That makes me so sick.
I am.so tired, i have been so tired since thursday.
I am neglecting my children because i am so tired.
I should find ways to get back together but i cant.
I am always alone, i lost my friends because all i do is nag and complain.
They dont understand what happened and they sometimes say how good i have it with my ex and that breaks me and makes.me hate them.
My ex is the devil.
I feel so helpless and cornered.
I would need some therapy but i am afraid because rhey told me it is my fauöt aswell and for years i tried to change myself only to end up being so traumatized and abused even more.
I always take the blame for everything and i dont want to anymore.
I want to be happy with my children

I would love to run away with them to get away from my ex because every little encounter is so toxic and breaking me
The easiest conversation turn into a fight and i cant do shit

It took me a whole year to get my.oldest in the same kindergarten that is closer to us because he always said it would be better for the child to stay where he is.
He is smart and no one suspects him to be the hole and devil he is.
On thursday there was only his helper , me and the women from jugendamt.
It was so obvious that his helper sees me as the problem and she attacked me, she thinks i am trying to make arguments and that i am naghing and not leaaving him alone.
Yes sometimes i am so frustrated that i write him a lot about how he doesnt care and how diffivult it is with him and that he needs help. But i try to never do thst but sometimes i just cant...
I know there will be better times and thst is becazse i am getting retraumatized but it feels like i dont.
I need to remind myself that i am safe...
Thanks for reading all this...
I feel  a little bit better already.
There is probably still a lot of questions but i cant put 2 years of horror and terror in a small text...

"i have anxiety and i theorise a touch of ocd. ever since learned how important sleep is to your body, ive dealt with immense anxiety over it. things such as will i get my appropriate 8 hours, and if i don’t, how will it affect me? i have to wake up at 7 am tomorrow, it’s currently 2:30 am. my heart is pounding out of my chest from pure anxiety, because i’m going to get minimum 4:30 of sleep, it’s driving me crazy. and because my heart is pounding out of my chest, i can’t get to sleep. this has happened countless times. i’ve been through anger, frustration, laughing at it, to being depressed over it- i’m just done with it. all i want is some sleep but clearly i can’t even get that. melatonin doesn’t work either. i feel as though it’s something medical but i’m not sure. i’m just done with it."

"Thank you for looking at my post.

I'm writing this because I feel like I need someone to tell me this is a bad idea. For context, I'm currently hooked up on my memories of a girl I really love and was together with her for sometime though we broke up on bad terms I have this feeling of trying to get her back again and well that's where I need someone to tell me that this is a bad idea and I shouldn't.

Part of me knows I shouldn't contact her again and hurt her but another part of me really wants to get back with her and regret ever breaking up with her. It's been a couple of years already and I still regret making such a stupid decision."

• I make mental connections that make me uncomfortable, like matching a shoe model called Samba, bought by my girlfriend, and I connected it to the chorus of a summer song ""sex and samba"", and this double reference to sex and summer has created distressing thoughts about my partner's past and summer relationships that unfortunately I wanted to know too much about.

• I often feel alone and want to be understood, I go through my address book looking for friends to talk to about my discomfort, even writing to people I haven't heard from in years. I browse personality disorder discussion forums looking for people to talk to and find empathy, understanding, reassurance.

• I often experience deep dysphoria, I feel like I have little patience especially in the family environment and it's easy for me to feel anger that I don't express and try to repress. Before I was more prone to even violent outbursts, now I can avoid them also because on a nervous level I suffer from them, feeling down and prostrated by the outburst in the following days.

• I can't experience sexual intimacy in a serene way with my partner, without having to ask her if this or that gesture we are doing, she has already done it. And when I ask I feel ashamed and afraid, because I need reassurance but at the same time I am afraid of receiving new information that creates new obsessions, especially if she were to give me an answer that does not reassure me, such as confirming that she has already done a certain thing, which would lead me to want to know more details about who, how, when etc.

• I can't deal with places, names, adverbial phrases or typical sentences that have characterized our discussions on the topic of the past, that recall her past before me. I try to avoid, especially names and places, to protect myself from the discomfort and anxiety they cause me.

• I can't look at men like before, I feel threatened by the presence of good-looking men around me. Both when I'm with her and even when I'm without her.  In the first case, I feel threatened by the fact that she might look at them and think they are good-looking. In fact, I end up asking her ""did you see that guy? How is he, cute?"" And obviously then if I receive confirmation that he is good-looking I feel even worse.
In the second case, I feel uncomfortable because I start to think: this man is good-looking, if she had met him she would have slept with him maybe, without even waiting too long (this additional detail comes from the fact that having navigated my partner's past in detail, has shown some evidence of how physical involvement in her relationships is in most cases, early). For this reason, I also avoid social situations with her, where these unwanted encounters could happen.

• I worry about what she, or others, might think of me, about my appearance, about my sexual qualities. This leads me to have constant anxiety about taking care of my appearance, and about being a good lover in bed. For example, I am very worried during intercourse, that my partner will be able to reach orgasm.
Obviously this performance anxiety also involves worries about my ability to delay orgasm and avoid premature ejaculation.
This concern about other people's thoughts also includes knowing her friends, or family members, because I worry about what they might think of me, about my appearance, or worse, they might make comparisons between me and her past partners in terms of physical appearance.

• In my family, I had a difficult childhood, with parents who did not make me feel accepted or loved. My mother suffered endless violence from my father, both physically and emotionally. My father was physically violent towards us since we were little. I still feel anger and hatred for my father.  My mother continues to live with my father and I am still in the same house as my parents when I am not in Milan for work. I believe that my father is a dangerous, toxic person, and that he has several serious mental disorders. Obviously he does not even ask himself this question and lives in complete ignorance of what he causes to others.

• Sometimes I think that perhaps with a partner with a different past, I would be less anxious, and I would not have these symptoms of jealousy about the past. It makes me think (and it hurts me to think it, because I realize that I am thinking these things about a person to whom I am attached), that having had a promiscuous sexual past and with many partners, I have always thought in life, that I would not have tied myself to one of these ""easy girls"", and that the girl I would have had by my side would have been a ""serious girl"". Instead I live this conflict of having fallen in love with a girl, whose past, if I had to give my opinion as an outsider not emotionally involved, I would have defined as a girl who has behaved a little too lightly at times, in the way she gave herself.

"I posted to another advice sub but I honestly couldn't stomach to put very many details and don't know if I can even leave the post up. I am struggling with some stuff at work (this is a gross understatement) and I think it may be the end of my time there, but I could really use some advice as far as timing/next steps/hypothetical decisions I could make. 

I'd really like to talk to someone a bit older than me that might have more experience navigating the employment/corporate world, even better if you have a background in academia. It's a huge can of worms so I'd appreciate it if someone were willing to listen to the whole story and give advice on the personal and professional aspects of the situation. Would prefer Discord to chat or maybe even vc."
"Hello. I believe I have some learning difficulties, maybe I even have some form of Autism. Despite this I always gave my best at school. At the end I have graduated with a Master's degree. Partly because I was ashamed of giving up as in our culture it's seen as a shame (but different topic, let's not go there). So, essentially I pursued this field that I don't have talent in or even enjoy. I don't really have much of a talent other than a good memory perhaps. 

I also have a childhood trauma. This is something that made me susceptible for addictions. Well, one addiction. Porn. So right now, I don't have a job as I can't bring myself to study extra long hours for this field to catch up as I can't release my emotions from my childhood trauma that causes me to want to watch porn to release some of the tension. I don't consume porn every day but it opens old wounds and I'm essentially always recovering from a mild breakdown. 

I have tried everything in order to overcome this addiction. Therapy did not help as I could not open up about the true reasons for this addiction. I am afraid the information can be used against me. Maybe my lack of trust is another symptom of my childhood trauma. Reading a dozen books on addiction made me realize how messed up my mind and my situation really is and drive me even more into addiction. 

I don't know how to break out of this cycle :("

Hi everyone


I’m struggling with guilt over some drawings I made for younger friends when I was 17. Now that I’ve turned 18, it’s been weighing on me more, and I’d really appreciate some advice or support.

I had two friends—one was 14, and the other was 15. Both asked me to draw characters for them, but now I’m worried about the appropriateness of the drawings, even though I didn’t intend anything harmful, or even knew at the time of what I was doing was bad, which I feel so fucking stupid about.

One friend asked me to draw a muscular character with abs, and I ended up adding some details that, looking back, make me feel uncomfortable. The other friend liked a character I drew—a chubby girl in a bikini and a nightgown, but there was nothing sexual about it. She was just supposed to be cute and playful, but now I’m scared it could be seen differently, and that just because I didn’t see it as sexual doesn’t excuse what I drew around younger friends. Ugh…

At the time, I didn’t think of these drawings as inappropriate, but now I’m really anxious and feeling guilty because they just feel weird, even if I didn’t intend for them to be sexual, and I always have a fear of maybe I did make them sexual without a care. I never wanted to make anyone uncomfortable, and I’m afraid that I might have crossed a line without meaning to, or if I just didn’t care about it at the time, which makes me feel even more worried about myself and others.

I’ve distanced myself from these friends because of these worries and haven’t talked to them in a while, but I’m still struggling with the fear that it might come up again or that someone might see me in a negative light for it, or if someone is going to bring it up and frame me for being a pedophile or weirdo which I feel very disgusted by. My anxiety is very bad, that I even fear of being doxxed as well for this.

Thank you for listening, and I genuinely hope I am not a bad person. Please, if anyone’s been in the same situation or knows if I’m a bad person or not, I would love to hear how I can fix it for everyone and myself."
"Je (h16) suis au lycée avec un ami et aujourd'hui j'apprends qu'il a un trouble qui altère sa réalité.
 Par exemple, une fois, il est venu en cours avec un platre au bras en disant qu'il s'était fait poignarder dans la rue mais en fait c'était totalement faux, il n'avait rien du tout. En revanche il était persuadé d'être fait poignarder et avait convaincu tout le monde de son état.
Je pense qu'il n'est pas conscient que ce qu'il dit c'est faux et qu'il se crée lui même des scénarios à partir de ce qu'il pense, de ce qu'il ressent. 
Aussi cet ami est dépressif, il a une vision très pessimiste de la vie et il est extrêmement demandant de moi car je suis son seul ami. Je pense qu'il sait aussi que je suis quelqu'un de très empathique et pour cela je ne le laisserais pas.
Mais en fait j'ai envie de me détacher de lui parce que je me sens mal quand il est avec moi, j'ai l'impression de ne pas contrôler ma vie, mais que ma vie soit contrôlée par les attentes de quelqu'un. Puis je me sens isolé car tout le monde le déteste et ça peut se comprendre, il est parfois désagréable voir même méchant donc personne ne veut de lui et moi j'ai l'impression que je suis obligé de rester avec lui parce que sinon il a plus personne. Donc les gens ne viennent pas ou moins vers moi quand je suis avec lui et pareil, moi je vais moins vers les autres car je sais qu'il restera avec moi et que les autres ne veulent pas de lui 
 En bref je reste avec lui par pitié et je sais que c'est une mauvaise chose pour moi et aussi pour lui. 
Je veux plus être hypocrite donc je vais lui dire bientôt que j'aimerais me séparer de lui mais je ne sais pas comment m'y prendre pour ne pas qu'il se sente mal au point de tenter de se suicider ou de se couper après ça. 

Donc si vous avez des conseils, je prends tout. N'hésitez pas à partager et à commenter si vous avec vécu quelque chose de similaire. J'ai vraiment besoin d'aide. 
Merci d'avoir lu jusqu'ici et merci d'avance pour ceux qui commenterons ce post 🙏🙏🖤"
Been extremely anxious lately and can definitely tell I’m starting to get extremely depressed 
Just want to distract myself. I promise not to be too dramatic 
"I'm done, work, kids, everything. I just want to crawl in a hole and be left alone to sleep and dream. I've had such a good year, I got promoted at work, met my best friend, have done amazing fun things with my kids, have had new experiences, partied, am the most financially stable I've ever been; but I'm just feeling so exhausted. I don't want to see a therapist or get medical help, I'm done with that, I've been doing it since I was a young teen. I haven't been depressed all year and then the last month has just really blown up and I'm struggling, I don't want to get out of bed, I need to clean and parent and work and I just can't move. Doesn't matter how good I'm doing there always seems to be barriers. Usually I'm good at pulling myself out of a rut but I just can't seem to this time. I don't want my loved ones to notice or know, I just want to be better. Anyway, I'm in a bit of a state right now and I'm rambling. Any tips? "

I don't know what to explain. I need mental support to prevent me keep numbing myself. Any kind words would be appreciated.
"Hi kind people of the internet,

Just looking for some tips, perhaps encouragement, perhaps a connection or two. I'm a woman in my late twenties, disabled, mentally ill and pretty lonely. I have a healthy-ish self-esteem all things considered but, objectively speaking, I lack a lot of the opportunities and experiences other people my age have. I'm also nowhere near to being in the clear - I do try, but I go through phases of pretty severe depression and tend to undo a lot of my progress in life during those times. I'm afraid all this makes me feel unrelatable or like too much to deal with for people who are healthier. I know how I can 'earn' my place in a relationship with someone who is also struggling, and I don't go out of my way to burden people, but I do need a fair amount of support that I currently do not have. I would like my relationships to feel mutual and somewhat equal, but I have no idea how to make that happen with people who seemingly need for nothing. I don't have anything against being friends with other struggling people, quite the opposite, but I'd like to be able to have relationships with abled people too without fearing they're based on pity (which has been the case in the past). Am I asking for the moon here? Help!

I would prefer messages over chat requests, thanks. :)"
"hello there, struggling one 👋

being 35, i've had a good share of negative experiences, in particular regarding interpersonal relationships, mostly of the romantic sort. i've also lost my father two years ago, his passing having caused me a great inner turbulence, and now i'm constantly bracing for the loss of my only real father-figure, my grandfather, due to his old age. social anxiety has stood between me and making the friends i'd need for a support system, but i'm still here. why? how? likely because i still have some hope for the things i long for, parents (now only my mother) who coddled my existence, and too because of my personality which has always been quite responsible, in terms of not lying to myself or others, at least. it's hard to look at oneself so rawly, but i can't truly say that it's time to go, because i can't truly say that i've tried all that there is to try. i've not exhausted every possibility, and i don't believe you have either. there are always new ways of seeing, new ways of being, but both require some faith. just like when a fledgling first dares to hop out from its nest having never flown before. hold on, and we'll get through this next cycle, returning to the up after this down.

feel free to send me a message with whatever it is that is on your mind, and i'll do my best to listen and engage with your matter in a way that i hope you recognise as real care, despite my infrequent exclamations and smiles. i'm not always awake, but when i am, i'm usually here to poke. it's late in Europe, and i'll be sleeping in an hour or so, but once my eyes reopen, and i've done the few things that need doing, i'll respond to your words. and finally, no matter when you read this post, you're welcome to reach out to me.

be well ✨"

"Day 70 part 3 
Dear diary, I keep messing up things maybe because I dissociate (unbearable pain) or say insensitive stuff (wanting pain to go away) and I am selfish from both of those reasons. I just want to get out all of my thoughts, feelings and what I say or do is often toxic. I don't know how to talk with princess. I am wondering how much fair it is to blame him by keep saying I am in pain (even when i just want to vent) or by saying I am angry (even when I just don't know how to live anymore). I guess we both don't know how to talk to each other now. But I need to try because then he will be gone.. i just don't know how to stop crying.

"I (32M) have been in relationship with girlfriend (28F) for 3 years now. Her impatience has always been an issue. Lately everytime she's on her period or before she starts to become extremely impatient, much more than usual. I've always been swallowed the things she said to me during that time or other. I guessed that's what I'm supposed to do, verbal abuse isn't exactly abuse, I'm not dead, am I? But being highly sensitive those moments hurt me, but I'm afraid of telling that, because she doesn't like it and threaten to leave me. I'm in the position in life, I'm going to fall apart if I lose her right now, so I just take it. Recently she made a bad joke about my father's passing away, I didn't want to feel bad because the intention wasn't to hurt me, it was her saying stuffs she didn't mean. I thought I was fine with it, but last night it resurfaced and when I shared the fact it bothers me, oh boy... 
To be honest, I'm really looking forward to be dead soon so that I don't have to go through suicide. Maybe it'd be logical to end it with her, but I'm not strong enough; I'd rather die than be alone. I had been losing hope and keep trying to rebuild, not just with her, but with my life. It feels like this world isn't for me. All the happiness is reserved for people with no trauma, but people like me, we are just excess in this society, so am I. I feel angry at myself for letting myself fall in love or hope to live a good life. Early death is the only good life I expect at this point."
I'm dealing with difficult family members amidst my own personal struggles. My family sabotages my plans to succeed in things important to me. Also deal with cptsd. I wanna get better and so I  need to vent about mistakes I made bc of the impact of trauma. Could s/o hear me out?

"I can make it better but I'm never going to feel 100% happy again so I'd rather just not be alive altogether. My depression stems from several different reasons and all but one of them is solvable so I'm just going to talk about that one.

The problem is that I hate working. I know I'm only 20 and most people hate working and I live in a first-world coutry but I don't give a fuck. I'm tired of working and there is not a single job that I will ever like enough to want to continue living. The only solution is to not work or only work 20 hours maximum which are both impossible. Not to mention that I have no drive to do anything and everything is boring (even things that used to be fun).

I want to go live in nature and live like a caveman but I would be lonely and that would get boring and I don't have the right skills. I'm just not meant to continue existing because if I were I wouldn't feel incredibly bored no matter what I do and would have the drive to stop being a pathetic loser and actually work towards a successful career."

"hi! i have been in the cycle of threatening and trying leave my cheating narcissistic boyfriend, successfully kicked him out finally early this year, but quickly fell back into the relationship due to the trauma bond and codependency he’s caused us to form. now he has changed some yes, had a job until this past month, wasn’t blatantly messaging other girls inappropriately, but the constant random lies, gaslighting, arguments anytime i was hurt by his actions, and overall manipulation and putting me down. he now has had no job for a month, he still since he’s been kicked out, been caught talking to females, getting the snapchats of fellow fortnite gamers that are female and “not saying anything bad”, so that it’s okay. every single female he’s talked to or messgaed even just on the xbox, i’ve found flirting, NSFW content, messaging very young girls. over a small case of his usual gaslighting today over dinner plans i lost it, i snapped, and i decided i’m done. now i’m home instead of spending the night there and my brains telling me i made a mistake? that i shouldn’t hurt him like that? as if i don’t have every right and know that i do, to leave.  i have no friends due to him isolating me, i really need someone to help validate my feelings about leaving him so that i don’t fall back into his trap. thank you "
"I’ll try to not make this too long, but I’ve just been feeling not so great the past two weeks especially since this past Friday. My mind has mostly been consumed by dark thoughts always berating that I’m not doing good enough or even just hurting myself. 

Regarding the job, it’s like I freeze up or my mind scrambles anytime I get asked a technical question as if they’re expecting me to know. It doesn’t help that the manager was annoyed or laughs at what he thinks are “stupid questions” though I understand he doesn’t want to repeat himself and means well. Also it feels like I’m expected to finish an assignment really quick, but I like to take my time to make sure I didn’t miss any details or that it was compiled properly. Again I feel like this isn’t helping and I should try, but it’s like my mind is going into overdrive cause there’s always that expectation. It doesn’t help that deadlines are looming, so it’s been more stressful than ever lately.

Regarding relationships, I have been feeling super lonely. It feels like most of the coworkers that I work alongside with there are either married or have a gf/bf. I’m trying so damn hard not to compare, but it just really sucks. I haven’t even been on a date or gotten a first kiss either which prob doesn’t mean much, but yeah.

Anyway I know this is super depressing and almost borderline suicidal, but I just feel so hopeless even though I have people in my corner, a roof over my head, something to eat and drink, and a nice bed to sleep on. I just want to run away from all this and take it easy somewhere nice up in the mountains with no care in the world."
My friend texted me last night saying she is really not doing well and I asked what was wrong but she wouldn't tell me. She said she wanted to sleep on it and she was in no state to talk about it. I'm so scared that I made a mistake letting her sleep I feel like I should have pushed more but I didn't want to offend. 5 years ago she had thoughts of suicide and I'm really worried about her I haven't heard from her since. It's been 10 hours

"I'm in a hard place right now. There are many  uncertainties about the future in my life whether it be for short or long term. And there are things I wanna change about myself in the meanwhile to pursue somethings I want in my life as well, but this part is a bit complicated. There might be a small hope but I feel like maybe I shouldn't bank on it. This was a hard day so the things that are hard to change make me feel sadder than usual.

Anyways, I'm looking for a conversation partner to get rid of the negative feelings being alone with these thoughts brings. I would appreciate it if those who would like to talk messaged me.

Just send me a message I'd be happy to help
18m.Somebody close to me is so worried for me that she is losing sleep and I feel so bad. I told her that I was gonna open to my mom about my feelings but my feelings are very very deep. I have felt suicidal and I'm so afraid to tell her because it's gonna change everything. I'm just so scared. I wonder if all this pain and sadness and loneliness is worth it. Nothing helps. People hurt me so much and I'm so tired of it all. I don't really know what I'm looking for I'm so scared that I'll die alone and I feel so hopeless.
"Life has been ass. I'm bitter and spiteful towards my parents and myself. We're poor and I'm unhappy. I blame them completely. Usually I know it's circumstances you can't control but they threw away all opportunities and made stupid decisions. I'm jealous of kids with good parents and leadership. My mom and dad taught me nothing and they believes that's normal. I can with 100% certainty say that the person I am is not cause of them.

I know I can't be blaming them forever, and that I need to grow myself to not end up like them. So I started my grind. Exercising and getting into hobbies.
These days I don't know what's wrong with me. It's like I'm working against myself. Just last week I was exercising, doing my grind and in a good mood but then I was like what's the point. After that thought I was stopped dead in my tracks. I didn't feel like doing nothing.

Edit: I was so heated I didn't put a proper title. Sorry

"How do you move on from a close college friend group that turned against you after a fallout with someone (ex- who was also the part of the group ), especially when you have to see them every day. To put icing on the cake one of the member of the X group broadcasted the whole story in front of the class while he was drunk and now I feel embarrassed to even enter the class."

" Will it be wrong to message a girl with whom I had never talked before but I know her name and she knows my name and we follow each other since she was one class below in my college?

The reason I want to do this is because I am hurt and not feeling well emotionally.. I love someone from the last two and half years and we were good friends and she used to call me almost daily but around three or four months back I told her what I feel about her and since then the phone calls decreased and I can even say that the phone calls stopped since her last call was on 3rd August.. I told our mutual friends that I don't love her anymore or miss her anymore but the truth is I still love her and miss her everyday..

So basically I want to message this new girl with the sole intention of dating only. I only know her name and have no idea if she had a bf or not. I don't have any feelings for her as such except for this little crush on her from last few months.. So will this be wrong..?"

"Hellooooo  everyone,

I really need to get this off my chest. I just have such a big urge to vent in the last days. I’ve been in three relationships so far, and after everything that’s happened, I find myself in s really bad depression. My first relationship ended with betrayal, well I was cheated on, which completely shattered my trust and broke my heart. I cried for weeks and lost all of my hope in humanity lok. In my second relationship, I realized he didn’t care about who I was as a person. I cried again for weeks. But we'll it was the third relationship that hurt me the most. It messed me up emotionally, sexually, and mentally. I’m still dealing with the consequences of this relationship every single day, and I deeply regret how stupid I was. I did things I never thought I would do. I feel betrayed, ashamed, dirty, used, and as if I’ve just been discarded. 

Now I find myself struggling with anxiety, depression panic and trust issues.. The thought of opening up to someone new and getting hurt once more is terrifying. I’m writing this because I feel broken, lonely and down. Maybe I just need someone to talk to, someone to offer some support or comfort. Just knowing that someone is there would really mean a lot right now. I'm happy about every message. :("
"I'm supposed to finish studying this online course this company is offering, with employment prospects. I had asked them for a break from it due to my mental health (but I just told them it was health-related). 

Now I'm back to it, since yesterday.

But of course I didn't get any better over my break. I'm still lying in bed crying, like before. 

Support usually helps me well... if I had any. So maybe someone will be kind enough to show me some so I could go on. 
"
i am so sad right now if anyone here? please? i just wanna talk
please i cant handle this pain any more please please im crying now
"Hi. I'm F13, nearly 14, that basically been stalked by a group of guys for months now. It all started last year October when this boy a year older than me (lets call him stalker1) liked me so he kinda talked about me a lot but not in the kindest way at all. Stalker1 started ""hating"" me when I accidently hit a yr7 (stalker2) with my bag and i realized too late for me to say sorry. And stalker1 thought I liked him and I have to be honest with this, I did, but not anymore obviously. And stalker1's other friends were also part of it (stalker3 and stalker4).

So this group of boys hated me for quite a while but they started stalking me in January. There was nothing I did that like really triggered them, they were just kinda curious because I was staying silent texting on my phone and they thought I was some mysterious person. So what did they do? They hacked my phone. By now I knew these boys had a problem with me and it was only after listening to their convos did i realize they hacked my phone. So this continued for months on end and I knew they were hacking my phone so I used to type text messages directed towards them. I even did a text message saying I want to talk to them to confirm they hacked my stuff (they didn't come up to me but they made it obvious they saw the message).

So one day I had enough and like a week before the easter break, my friend (who knew every single detail) and I decided to report them. I was reluctant before because i thought they'll do something even worse and I was right. Because they made a video (which I now think is viral) about me. And on the video they claimed I was racist cause I ""only date black guys"". This isn't true. Before I said my type was black guys (cause i tended to be more attracted to them) but I decided to quit that type of thinking about love months before they made the video cause I didn't want to be toxic. And now I just think love comes when love comes. They made the video on tiktok but I don't have tiktok so I've never actually seen the video but it kinda gets obvious when your whole town and everyone in your class talks about you being racist wherever you go. They also started spreading rumors that I was racist because I assumed stalker1's ethnicity. And I'm ngl i did think this guy was Asian but he's black. But in my defense someone in my class did say he was racist for saying the n-word when he was Asian, not black. So someone literally told me he was Asian. i do feel bad for that but i dont think it deserves all the hate I'm getting. They also had the audacity to switch it around saying I was obsessed with them. But like you literally went out of your way to read all my messages for months

So when this video got around, I started getting suicidal thoughts and depression cause my whole school and the area I lived in thought I was a disgusting piece of rubbish which really affected me because I was getting talked bad behind my back everyday. I remember when a girl in my class said the world is better of without me and I think I went home and cried. People also thought I was gay. And like I get I'm not the most feminine person out there but its a bit of stretch. 

So when I thought it couldn't get any worse, it got worse. I was really confused when the stalkers started talking about me having a snap. And my parents don't let me have snap so I didn't have a snap. I think someone made a fake snap pretending to be me and they used deepfakes. The stalkers hacked that snap thinking it was me and I think the identity thief made it look like I do incest. And they probs made it look like I do a bunch of other disgusting stuff too but I'm not on tiktok to see the vids they make about me.

So then the year ended and I still wasn't sure whether they were off my shoulders. I was changing schools to a boarding school anyway (reason not relevant). I still did feel depressed tho. Like I was alive but not living. I decided to tell my mum about this hoping she and my dad could get me some professional help but they got angry that I didn't tell them sooner, saying I need to forget about them and be happy. Saying I was weak and they were never like me at my age. They also judged me for caring in the first place. They punished me a took away my phone and laptop for a couple of weeks. But also during the summer holiday I heard my brother talking about me. I confronted him on it saying all the stuff they said about me wasn't true. But he acted clueless making me question reality. But then I heard him on the phone with stalker1 and stalker1 was telling him I was the one lying. I'm not sure whether the snap identity thief was tryna make it look like I do ""only date black people"" and stalker1 still thought it was me, or he was just lying. Anyway now my brother thinks I'm a annoying, self obsessed attention seeker.

I really don't know how to fix this messy and confusing situation and I feel like it's escalated to far for it to be fixable in the first place. I kinda attempted to kms yesterday by straggling myself with a plastic bag tying a cable around neck but I backed out. That when I realised I needed some help so I wrote this. I just feel like nobody will know the truth and everyone will forever think of me as this horrible, disgusting being. I don't even go the school anymore but I feeling like they can try to spread the same rumors around at my new school and they'll be no escape because it's a boarding school. If my brother believes them more than me, then anyone can. I'm desperate at this point."
"This is my first time posting, so I hope this is the right place. Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed by a lot of emotions, and it seems like the people closest to me don’t fully understand or care about what I’m going through. Initially, I thought it was just them, but I've started noticing that I feel the same way with almost everyone, which makes me think the issue might be with me.

I’m beginning to wonder if I get too attached to people. It’s difficult to understand how they can’t seem to grasp what I’m feeling. I live with this constant pain, feeling like I’m never enough for anyone. To cope, I often go overboard—buying expensive gifts or making myself overly available to others, just to prove my worth. I fear that if I don’t, people will see me as average, find someone better, and I’ll end up alone.

These feelings aren’t just limited to my relationship with my girlfriend; they extend to my sister, brother, and even my friends. I tend to drop everything I’m doing to be there for them, often at the expense of my own well-being. I’m aware that people have taken advantage of this, and it’s happening even now. I realize it, yet I still find myself always there for them. However, when I need help, everyone seems to be too busy.

I’m not sure how to change this, but the pressure of constantly trying to prove myself is overwhelming. If anyone could suggest some books, exercises, or anything that might help, I would be incredibly grateful."
The days are super long preparing for this exam and not many people get how draining that is! Thank you! 
If there's anyone out there that would like to talk to a depressed man close to 30 let me know. I don't have friends at all in life and could use someone to talk to.
"I feel hopeless, in large part due to the problems I'm dealing with:

1. Did not submit my graduate thesis on time and risk getting removed from the program

-&gt; I spoke with the Graduate Director and they are willing to try and help me find a way back into the pgm but my own supervisor said they are unable to help.

-&gt; Now this could be b/c they recently switched departments (were teaching as part of two different faculties) and the new one is not in the pgm. But given how short there response was, when I asked to speak to them (essentially saying I hope this email finds you well but I am unable to help at this time and I wish you all the best), I think its more than likely they are rightfully angry with me for dropping the ball as my graduate study was part of a paper they were looking to publish. I can only imagine how angry they must be at me and since receiving a response from them I have been in a spiral and am scared to respond (if I should) or even contact my grad director again.

2. Always flunking at interviews. I have a decent job as a PM but its a contract position and every time I apply and get an interview, I screw it up one way or another and have a hard time articulating what i did wrong. This is probably b/c I am not the best when it comes to critical thinking.

-&gt; My parents keep pressuring me to find a permanent job with better pay and think I'm just coasting at my current place of employment but I can't tell them I actually do get interviews but always fail at the second or third round b/c I'll come across as a bigger disappointment than I appear to them now.

3. I'm not physically or psychologically ready to have kids despite pressure from my family.

-&gt; Given I am not stable in my career, nor rich and successful, and the fact that I am not in great physical shape, I feel like I am not ready to bring a child into this world when I can't be a stable provider or a good influence on them

-&gt; More than that, I am ashamed at what my potential future child would think of me when they grow up and realize that I am just a failure and my legacy is just failing at everything. I failed to get into medical school, I will likely fail my grad program, I failed to get a permanent full time job and/or a government job (which was why I enrolled in a masters pgm to begin with as most jobs require or vastly prefer a candidate with a graduate degree), I failed to get a property of my own (currently we rent an apt in a condo). The last thing I want to do is taint a beautiful child with my failure.

I feel like I've failed at life. I'm an absolute dud with no redeeming qualities and its only a matter of time before my partner finally realizes that I'm a failure and she will leave me too. I take medication and therapy to try and combat this negativity but its really hard to see a way forward. I know life goes on but sometimes I just want to give up. I just feel really low."
"I don't know what the [o] stands for but I put it in.
Anyway, my husband bit my neck hard (I'm walking around my business professional job with this huge spot on my neck) and manhandled me last night out of anger. This is nothing new, I've left him before to come back to promises he mostly lived up to but we are edging back to the same ol thing and I am SICK of the ""I'm stressed"" bullshit. 
That doesn't give you the right to rough me up in any way.
I'm sick of it and slowly planning for the worst (I'll leave again if I feel like I'm in danger), I love him I just don't have it in me anymore.
 
Mad or not I can't imagine putting hands on him and not to mention the emotional neglect and abuse he puts me through (I won't post that again in a larger reddit group bc I got crucified once already and i dont think people understand how defeating it can be).
I feel so emotionally exhausted and worried I've lost just about all feelings for him, I'm just saving up to escape him again if it doesn't resolve itself at this point.
But that feeling of hatred and resentment doesn't go away anymore. 

I'm ridiculously optimistic so I want to keep trying. I don't want to but I really find him disgusting anymore. I don't know how I'm going to spend time with him this weekend knowing I can't wipe this look of disappointment and disgust off my face.

Anyway that felt good to get that off my chest. I hope everyone is having a good day and I'm going to make the best of mine. 👍🏻 "
"I got an amazing job opportunity that allows me to go live abroad for a year, and I’m thrilled about it. I leave tomorrow. But I’m also so sad because I can’t take my cat with me. I’m leaving him with my family, but he’s not very close with them and spends all of his time in my room and cuddling with me in my bed. He sleeps with me every night - first thing I do in when I wake up is tell him good morning because he’s always at my side. I just can’t help but cry when I think of how sad he gets when I’m gone, apparently he just meows over and over and looks for me. 

He also just turned 14, and I keep worrying that something will happen while I’m gone and this’ll be the last time I ever see him. I raised him from a kitten when I was just a kid myself, and I feel like I’m leaving half of my soul behind. 😭"
"\[19M/NB\] for context, both me and this person did a cosplay, and theirs is great and they seem to be more liked than i am, and their cosplay is probably better than mine in many ways and it's great for them, i know that me being envious is not their fault and i'll never make it their problem, i know that i'm feeling like this because i'm the problem here and i'm the one who's insecure and not good enough at anything. I know it seems stupid that i feel all of this just because of cosplay but i guess that's how triggers work when you're traumatized and fucked up and you come from a family that would treat you like garbage for hobby and you're in a condition so bad that it's really hard to find decent treatment for. I try to help myself but sometimes it's so hard to just keep up the ""everything is fine"" mask all the time and pretend you don't hate yourself just to seem friendly.

I tried to read a guide on how to stop feeling envy and it told me to focus on my own qualities, but i feel like i have no qualities, i have nothing good to offer, my presence is annoying and bothersome, i feel like everyone hates me and i make everyone angry just by being there, i feel inferior, insecure, ugly, unlikable, annoying, boring, uninteresting. I hate myself, i hate everything about me, i hate my existence, i hate that i was allowed to exist, i hate everything i touch, i hate everything i make, i hate everything that is related to me in any way, shape or form and everything that has my germs and i hate being stuck with myself in this equally disgusting body being this disgusting person that i am, and even if i have pretended to not have any of those issues for so long, i still feel like i'm disgusting and hateable and i'll never be anything or anyone and i feel like anything i could possibly do well - cosplaying, makeup, digital art or anything at all - just gets completely neutralized because my self hate ruins every single bit of value that anything i make can have. I just wanna fucking give up"
"hey everyone. i've been having a rough time and am feeling really anxious about life circumstances. i just want to get myself to a spot of feeling less panicked. it's sort of embarrassing, so i'll save the rest for our messages.

"Name's Nathan and honestly i feel as if people aren't as genuine these days, soooooooo I'm here to be a genuine mate to anyone who wants to talk!!! Reddit is a great place and i really wanna connect with all types of people from around the world and learn all sorts of cultures!!

About me I am a high school student in Australia completing his final Year and looking to talk to some new people to also take my mind off the impending exams....... I am someone who is very extroverted like legit when you get to know me I will never shut up....... I love sports cricket, basketball, tennis, baseball, soccer, football, footy, you name it!!!!

Now that you've heard a bit about me come and talk!!!! promise I am really nice and even if you wanna vent or share your problems I'm here to listen and give advice!! all i ask is don't be rude or ghost otherwise I don't wanna talk!!

That's all from me..... Looking forward to meet you all!!!"
I'm 17m and idk if I wanna turn 18 the thought of kms keeps crossing my mind and I'm scared it'll all get worse when I become an adult no one would miss me or even notice I'm gone I'm always so lonley and never feel like im walcome around peole like an outcast and I don't even have that big of an impact on anyone's life's I just make everything worse and anytime I try to do anything I just mess literally everything up I think this would just be a better world without me.
When of the hardest things we do in our lives is to do what is right and true to ourselves. I recognize that's a tough journey and here to support as best I can. You have the right to live your life the way you see fit. Others may not react well but it doesn't take away from what is true to you. I am a 40s male here. Open minded and free of judgements. Let's chat... 
"I feel lonely because I don't have a girlfriend but I know that it's kinda dumb to focus on something I just can't really change but at the same time can I change it? I look at advice and it's always ""go out to social places"" or ""go to clubs"" which I don't doubt work but once I'm there it's so difficult to approach people. I usually go to the pub with friends and it's weird cause I get there and it just doesn't feel like there's anyone I'm interested in speaking to other then my friends and everyone else with their own friend groups anyway.

So when I'm out I feel like I'm getting nowhere and once I get home and away from people that's when this lonely pathetic feeling kicks in. And over thinking. I over think a lot. I often run through the cycle of
""Oh it's your fault you don't approach women"" and yeah it is but at this point I'm at home so its not like I can approach anyone new. Then there's the whole ""are your intentions good?"" I want to meet more girls so l have a more diverse social network. But the only reason I'm trying to is because l'd like a romantic relationship with a girl. So are my intentions ultimately to get a girlfriend and there go have bad intentions?

I just hate how my mind sinks like this and doesn't help I'm trying to kick a bit of a porn addiction l've realised I've developed to make up for the lack of intimacy in my life.

I just don't know."
"(TW: Everything, lol) First off, I'm sorry but I feel uncomfortable getting help from anyone who has current or recent suicidal thoughts that have an actual chance of acting on them. I get really nervous about that kind of thing, for other people specifically. If it's well in your past, or it's passive and little to no chance of acting on it, that is fine.

Anyways, there are actually 2 reasons why I struggle to have a will to live.

1) I've had OCD my entire life. Even when I was 11, I told my parents I wished I could go to sleep and not wake up. Every day is fighting an uphill, never-ending battle, and it feels like if I slip up for even a second it comes crashing back. It's a horrible thing to deal with and has stolen so much joy from me. I think it's the mental equivalent of chronic pain. I feel like I'm just stuck with having so much fear in me, for the rest of my life. It's just a huge parasite and sucks the life out of me. I hate living in fear and anxiety all of the time. I wish I could actually be relaxed enough to enjoy life.

2) I had some extremely bad panic attacks in the past, that left me crippled and barely functioning for a long time afterwards. Like barely eating, sheer terror 24/7 that I could only escape when I was asleep. Too afraid to be left in my own mind, because it was constantly just pure terror feasting on me. Even though I'm emotionally ""gotten over it,"" it's one of those things that really opens your eyes to suffering. I had no idea that that much suffering was possible, but now that I know it is, I can't forget it. This life is so incredibly fragile and at any moment, the carpet can be pulled up from under you, and you can be sent to a world of suffering. I hate living when I know I could be sent back into this any day now, being alive just feels like a liability, an accident waiting to happen. Choosing to be alive seems like a dumb idea for me, given that I am much more mentally fragile than most.

I've done a LOT of research into how to do it. I've made 2 attempts and been on death's doorstep. I feel like once you stare death in the face, it changes your life forever and how you think about life. There are so many hobbies I want to do regularly again, more pets I want to love, people I want to love... but I don't know if it's even worth it. If life = suffering, what if I just am done with suffering? Does there even need to be any big earth-shattering reason to do it at this point? Isn't it more like a calculated decision to protect myself from more suffering? Are some people's lives just not worth living, and is mine one of them? And, would an all-loving God really send some mentally ill person to Hell for eternity because suicide is a ""sin?""  I have so many questions. PLEASE no fear-mongering, I already do enough of that to myself :/ I have suicidal intent fairly often, probably 1-2 times per month that each lasts like 3 days. I feel like I'm stagnating in life because every time I make progress on my habits and hobbies, it all gets destroyed and I go back to square one when I get depressed. I feel like with the trajectory I'm on, it's almost inevitable to happen, sooner or later. (Note: I am NOT actively suicidal right now. I am just being transparent about the ebb and flow of my life and what led to making this post. I am not in danger of hurting myself *right now*.)

The really weird thing too is my life is great on paper, as far as relationships/pets/education/career prospects/money/hobbies. The only thing in my life that really sucks is my mental health. And none of those other things seem to make up for it. It's like comparing a 9/10 good day with a -1000 / 10 bad day. I wish someone else had my life, and my (mostly) healthy body, someone who would deserve it more and appreciate it more, rather than someone like me who just wants life to be over. I'd be more than happy to donate all my organs to other people, and go out in a good way.

Notes: I only really use Discord. I am in Eastern Time. I have 2 therapists, lots of meds, and have done Residential/PHP/IOP, and ERP (which I think is the most effective, but haven't even had the will to do that lately). I prefer polite advice (I am okay with harsh truths, but compassionately). If we talk, please be willing to be in it for the long haul, because frankly I am very messed up, have done messed up things, etc., and I feel really let down when someone leaves me. Recently, my past groomer cut me off (of all people), and my OCD therapist is threatening to temporarily suspend services with me (because she doesn't have enough time to give me a ""higher level of care""). I love my Bf but he has no experience dealing with this kind of shit (neither do my family). The only person I can talk about this stuff, who seems to really get it, is my other, general therapist, but meeting once or twice a week only can accomplish so much. I could really use someone to talk to at nights when I need somebody to lean on, about how I'm feeling. But jsyk, it's not every single night, it's sometimes more than others. Finally, thank you for reading!"
"Well... I say little cause we exchanged around 4 sentences and it kinda fades into a bad note. This is one of the ugly fights, I know it. I hate fighting or arguing with my mom cause it never gets resolved. There is one time we fought about something I don't even remember (I think it was money related) and she didn't talked to me for half a year! And we live in the same house!! It was during pandemic too!! I hate it when it gets like that. I HATE IT! I'm doing somethign and have something to look forward to and now this little dispute is sucking the life out of me, bringing me down. We have each other's faults, I know. We suck at communicating. We don't talk it out like proper adults. I keep questioning whether I'm the toxic one or I'm having a narcissistic mother. This is just a ""little fight"" but it's giving me great deal of stress, the only thing that could save me from this is to distance myself from her. If I can get away and have my own place I would but I can't! She's doing it again... like being this passive aggressive type fight where she doesn't acknowledged me when I pass the room. Yeah it's LITTLE but i cant handle it! She doesn't want to talk me? Fine, I have my own crap to deal with anyways. And then maybe after a few days.. Or weeks!! we would talk again like it never happened. No sorry, no nothing. Then another another toxic cycle continues if there's one little thing we disagree about. Ok mom. I'm the problem. Clearly I'm not trying my best for things to be better.

I'm venting again... sorry I don't have someon to talk to atm. This helps a bit. "

Ok, I’m 18m and at the beginning of the summer I started snapping this girl that I had wanted for a while- I was flirting w her for a while and i realized she seemed to want me too- we were somewhat friends before but I wanted to ask her out and stuff for a min - she agreed and we went to the beach one night and made out under the stars, and have been texting and talking ever since. We send each other goodnight/good morning messages, and tell each other to text when we get home- the other night we went to the movies together and it was so nice-she said she really enjoys spending time with me- I’ve been wanting to keep seeing her ever since and we’ve already made more plans to hang out- I would definitely date this girl but I have like 2 1/2 weeks before I move back into school and she goes to school 45 mins away but lives like an hour and a half away. I just don’t know what I should do. I do really want her"
I am currently going through some stuff regarding sucide and other mental health stuff. Any help would be greatly appreciated 
"I have friends, mother, cat, partner. I was total empath. I do work at myself. I became more intelligent, I did many challenges, i start to put myself first, I have started to give myself breaks, I finally sleep more or less, I still have some problems in rl but 

The thing is I don’t feel anything: not love, not care. Nothing. I feel like I’m drowning. I don’t think that it is depression. I basically feel nothing to anyone even if I feel good. I felt something to my partner but now I feel nothing to anyone

I can dismiss someone or crush them mentally not because I do love to see their pain but because I don’t feel anything at all. Yes, I put up myself first, I communicate with myself and my friends also have no idea what’s going on with me 

I basically can do whatever I want and right now I write this all without any regret or emotions. I was been different but now im another person

"I feel like a failure at 24 and I am worried about my future.

I am a 24 year old male living in the UK, due to the recent changes in immigration law I am having to move out of the UK as I do not earn enough to renew my visa and most graduate job openings either do not pay enough or the companies were not sure they could sponsor me and rarely gave me the time of day during the recruitment period.   


I had always planned to move to mainland Europe for a cheaper masters once my Graduate visa was over but decided to stay in the UK one year after graduating as I felt I wanted to finally settle down somewhere (I've been lucky enough to move to three different countries since I was 7), shortly after was when they changed the laws. My options were to move back to my home country, where I do not really have any friends and the minimum salary is just over $400 a month for most starter roles (If I was lucky to find a good one) or move to Spain, where I have a couple friends/family and I could get EU citizenship after two years and could get my masters (In theory solving my two big problems, Qualifications for the career switch I want to do and no longer have to worry about visas). I decided on the latter since I saw that as the best option.  
  
The main thing I am struggling with, besides the difficulty of moving yet again, is that during these two years I will have to live off my dad's money, as the immigration status I will have does not allow me to work, I could get odd jobs that pay cash in hand (few people I know have recommended some places they know ) but I would be afraid to ""get caught"" and then have to be deported from Spain. My family, including my dad, is pretty well-off and he had already been pushing me to take this route, saying he'd supported my brothers in similar ways before (I was the only one to get a job that paid enough to be completely independent straight after uni). I am feeling like shit and like a failure for living off my dad's money at 24 for two years, and also worried at the fact of taking an almost two year long career break, (well, one if a masters degree ""does not count"" as a break but that won't start until September 2025) and basically switching careers by the time I am 27. I've had talks with my dad where he reassures me but I always end up worrying and in general feeling like a failure (sometimes I wonder if I could've done more to stay in the UK and remain independent).  


Is this career break ok? Or am I making a mistake? Is there anything I can do during that first year so my career break doesn't look as bad? I can do anything as long as it isn't paid.

"I recently did something really stupid on chaturbate, and I'm now terrified of what's going to happen.

I was chatting with a random model while camming and having a convo with sexual fantasy stuff like beach perving and asked if she liked that. (Never been banned for this) I didn't tell her this was fantasy stuff, btw just going with the flow asking random questions and saying random fantasies like massage palour stuff 

I then went on to say something really dumb about teasing girls at a beach wearing speedos, and one happened to be a school girl who came and felt me up.  I know this is very distasteful, and I should have never said that.

The next thing I know, my account is banned, and it says that those kinds of things are reported to authorities. I am honestly freaking out that I am going to get arrested for something that never ever happened. 

The only good thing for me is I said in the chat that I don't think that's right and I am not into that, and I went away as soon as she said that. But honestly, this incident never actually occurred. It was a scenario I created to see her response and get a bit of entertainment out of that. Effing dumb! I know, and I am regretting it big time 

I sent multiple emails to them to explain what happened, but I haven't heard a thing back from them. I don't know if I should go to the authorities myself before they come to me and this gets out of hand.
I know I should have never said such a thing as it violates their terms and conditions by even pretending any kind of role play involving minors or anything like that.  They say they can pass my information onto authorities in these cases due to certain US Act

I feel like they are now going to be watching me, and they will come to my place and arrest me over this stupid thing I said. Because I'm not sure if the model or they knew I was kind of role-playing and making stuff up as I went 

What do I do? Should I go and talk to a lawyer before this all blows out of hand and my life goes down the drain. I've never shared any pics or videos of anyone on that platform whatsoever. Never had any interaction like that whatsoever 

This stress I created for myself has completely put me away from ever doing a cam show or sex chats with anyone ever again. 

I don't know what to do now? Am I being paranoid or should I be worried?"
"I need some advice on how to deal with feeling down. I’m not sure if it’s depression, but I feel really sad whenever I'm not with my friend. It's starting to mess with how I go about my day, and I just don't know what to do. :("

"18M- I have been feeling really upset and stressed lately regarding everything that has been going on in my life. My parents yelling at me everyday for wanting to go out to get away from the toxicity, working all day everyday, wanting a gf and to be happy with someone but can’t seem to lock one in - being lonely, not knowing the last time I was genuinely happy and not feeling like things are improving. I just have this fear that my life is always going to feel like this, like I’m always going to be troubled by these things I’m hurt by at 18. Like things aren’t going to get better or I don’t know how they will. I just need some reassurance I guess."
"Honestly I have wanted to talk about this for a while, but afraid to. I am a very jealous person and I can't help it I truly do try and be good for my gf but I can't help it, it doesn't matter if she talks to another person or mentions another person or anything I just get so jealous and feel like I'm not enough and she has Snapchat and constantly adds random guys and girls and talks to them so so much and it just makes me jealous and angry. As I'm writing this we were supposed to call but then she went to call a bunch of random people in a group chat. I just have this problem of wanting her all to myself and I wish this feeling would go away"
"I've created this throwaway account to ask for advice. I've been chatting on here with someone for 6 months.  However, he's losing interest. I'm gutted, but I can understand it. I'd like some advice about how to end the online relationship with grace and dignity, and how to boost myself up again. Thank you "
"Hey! :)

I saw a couple posts talking about self-harm and suicidal thoughts on reddit recently. I have been through a lot of those things myself but have left most of that behind by now. But since I have a lot of experience with these things from years of struggle with mental illness and mentally ill partners/friends I think I can maybe help some others with that experience at least.

And now everytime I see a post like that with someone in despair because of the struggle and pain I just want to give them a hug or talk to them. And I often think how great it would be if you could somehow have a sign over your head in real life that shows people that they can come and talk to you if they are struggling because I've been there and know how lonely it feels. 

I just hate the thought of possibly strangers going through this shit sitting next to me in a university lecture or something not having anyone to talk to while I would love to help them but don't know they are struggling. But I know how hard it is to talk about these things and how much shame and self worth problems can be associated with them so I know people aren't just going to start venting to some stranger because they can't know how they would react.

Then I found this subreddit which is close enough to that idea I guess so I want to give it a try.

So if you have anything you need to talk about or want advice about or whatever else it is feel free to message me.  I don't have regular times where I know I'm available but after you message me we can either just chat then or find a different time.

You can also message me through discord (on the KindVoice Discord) under the username ""Faenilur"" to avoid reddits shitty messaging system."
"I'm looking for some emotional support. Being very disheartened about why my life has been one fall after another despite the fact that I'm doing everything I can to become the best version of myself that I can be. I never got any validation, or any win in life. I'm feeling every bitter and confused about why and how I either fail or suck at everything I ever tried. And the worst part is, the harder I try, the worse it gets.  
  
--------------- Venting and laundary list of my mistery starts, feel free to skip ------------  
I kept seeing my friends making 3X of salary, buying a 3million house in the city of SF, and I lost my job twice due to layoffs. They couldn't stop talking about their perfect husband and fancy, exotic vacations and I got rejected by ""prince charming"" and am now too old to be visible.   
I was a very career driven person, but suffered two job losses for no fault of my own. I am a math major, but taught myself to be come a data scientist, then a machine learning engineer. Dealt with terrible misogynists(I'm a woman) and a lot of imposter syndrome. Worked super hard and hope to earn myself some promotion or something. But nope, every single job, ended up letting me go when they can't sell the stuff we build.  
On the personal hobby front, I was a avid climber for 8 years, but I was never good enough to be accepted by the climbing community. After countless many injuries, I decided to quit because I realized it's not worth hurting my well-being to just fit in. I then pick up ballet, b/c I THOUGHT I was graceful (I'm super embarrassed to even saying it, haha). Two days ago had the audacity to check my form in the mirror and it as so ugly. 😭 I literally had a nightmare that night.  
The irony is, I recently started writing a fantasy novel with the intension of encourage people to see their worth from within, and not relying on any external validation. I though after years of therapy and emotional healing, maybe I can share something helpful for others to find their won happiness. But ended up in this rabbit hole of why I can't have a win.  
Growing up always being called fat and ugly by my Mom(biological Mom, to be precise) and everyone else around me, I never felt attractive. I think the only competition I'm winning is at losing every rat race I'm entering. I honestly have no idea how I manage to be such a loser w/o even trying.

"33 this weekend. Missed so many milestones and while I could say ""it's not even funny"" I've heard plenty of people laugh.

"After making the difficult decision to leave my old job, I applied and was hired somewhere new. I tearfully and anxiously started the offboarding process from my old job and terrifiedly started onboarding to the new one.

Onboarding was a bit bumpy but not more than I expected as I'm not good with change. After orientation I was sent to learn registers.

I was put with a girl who seems nice and knows what she's doing very well, but after a bit she had to go to break so I was shifted to someone else. This person didn't seem quite as nice but also knew what she's doing so I tried to make a good impression. After being there for maybe 30 minutes, I catch another cashier mouthing something to her while she was standing behind me. I don't know what she said, but I did very clearly catch the other person say ""what's wrong?"" *Pause* ""you don't like her?"" to her when she thought I wasn't looking. I'd known her about 30 minutes  

I wanted to burst into tears right there and turn around to her and ask what I did wrong, but I didn't think ugly crying was exactly a better first impression to make. It's been days though and it's unfortunately stuck with me, now every interaction I have I'm looking for signs I'm unwanted. Even when people are nice to me, I wonder if secretly they don't mean that."
"Hey everyone.

Throughout my whole life, all I could ever face was rejection from everyone. I've had no true friends, or love interests, nothing. I've struggled with loneliness for almost 3 years now, and now, it's agonising. I doubt my own humanity, because people would have accepted me if I was human. I feel like I have no one to turn to, because my family doesn't understand me, and my mom's an alcoholic.

I just wish someone could hold me tightly, tell me everything will be alright. I wish I could have my pain cuddled away right now. I wish I was worthy of love and care.

Thank you for reading."

"I discovered this subreddit and I think it is an ideal opportunity to help. 

If you need a shoulder to cry on, a more neutral opinion, advice, or just to vent (the latter helps a lot), I can try to help without judgement.

I think it's much easier to share your problems with a stranger because you don't feel like they can judge you as much as a friend or family member might. 

In the past I wasn't happy and my life was a mess, I know how that feels, now I'm good, so I want to do my bit to make other people's lives a bit better."

I have been at this job for 6 years.

I work for a small (9-10 employees) e-commerce business in Asia owned by an American. They were looking for someone to do digital marketing. They said on the job description they would train me. I wanted to write for a living even though my English wasn't on par with them. I was not educated in an English speaking environment although I'm familiar enough with the language. On the first day the manager started yelling in the meeting room. I was there. I decided I shouldn't quit just because of that. I just needed to grow up so I stuck around but the idea of work filled me with dread.

I'll mention that during the interview I was also asked a trivia question about a quote from Macbeth because I was an English major and mentioned in my resume that I worked on a play. When i couldn't tell where the quote was from i was given the ""you made it up"" reaction. That really did a number to my self esteem. He also told me I didnt know anything and should be applying as an intern and interns don't get paid. I got the job anyway. I guess he was just teasing but nevertheless.

Fast forward weeks after I was hired, the manager wanted me to write marketing content. This one time I had to come up with subject lines and he only told me they all sucked. The copy were also torn apart, being told it was ""pre-teen level book reports"" or that the English was weird. Most of the time he would have this fed up look and take my seat and type on my desktop himself. This usually happened right before 5 when it's time to leave.

I think I grew to dislike the way I write and always expect to be treated with disdain so I didn't have any drive. Most of the time I was left alone not told to do anything. Then I got blamed because I wasn't doing anything and I feel this huge amount of guilt about work. I think finding a new job is probably the best thing but i have been putting it off for so long. I'm also scared of an interview, being told I suck or being yelled at. I go to work each day feeling like I'm just trying to survive.

From my boss' perspective maybe he thinks he's helping me by hiring/not firing me. He said he didn't know what I could do but let's figure it out.  With that, I feel blamed for not being able to figure/let them figure out what I could do. 

He said I had all the resources and there's no pressure I just didn't use them and instead did nothing. I think I did what I could. I may be less proactive than they'd have liked but if something needs to be done I'll do it. I also stayed late when I didn't have to, came to work on weekends, etc. 

I got treatment for depression shortly after starting working here and my boss also knew that."
"

Ok, I had been talking to and trying to get to know this girl for a few weeks now and have started to really like her- we’ve gone to the beach together, and hung out a couple other times, I just really want to keep seeing her- we basically made plans and she basically told me we were gonna watch the stars together so we planned for a few weeks to do it since things kept getting in the way of our plans. The day comes and she says she has to lmk bc she might have to watch her siblings or something- then she snaps back HOURS later and basically said she didn’t have any plans just felt like she was leading me on and even tho she “does like me” she doesn’t want to lead me on further bc she isn’t ready to “Date” yet even tho I said we don’t have to have a label right away I just genuinely enjoy her company. Now she snaps me back once every few hours, seems dry and I don’t know what to do, I can feel her pulling away, and I don’t understand what I did. I usually go by “If she wants to , she will” but I don’t know how to navigate this. Any advice is appreciated."
Around my age 30+ 
"Hey everyone,

I’m currently a third-year student at a Higher School of Management and Economics, and life has been quite a rollercoaster for me. Back in high school, I managed to do well on my final exams despite not focusing much on my studies. Making it to this higher school was seen as my ticket to a better future, and it felt like a big accomplishment at the time.

I've had my share of ups and downs in relationships. I once found myself in a complicated love triangle where I made some decisions I now regret. It was a tough time emotionally, especially when my efforts to help someone I cared about academically didn't go as planned.

Entering this higher school, I felt like I was on top of the world. I let my ego get the best of me, thinking I was smarter than I really am. However, reality hit hard early on when the academic demands proved challenging, and I was faced with the pressure to perform or risk being sent back home.

During my first year, my personal life took a toll as well. My relationship became toxic under the weight of societal expectations and personal ambitions. We eventually broke up, and while it was tough, it also motivated me to focus on my studies and make a comeback academically.

Moving into my second year, I managed to improve my grades despite ongoing anxiety about my performance and future prospects. Along the way, I met someone new online, and we started dating. While it started well, distance and typical relationship challenges took their toll, leading to our recent breakup. It became even more complicated when she started struggling with substance abuse, which has been incredibly hard to witness.

She recently reached out to reconcile as friends, but it's been adding to my stress. I care about her deeply, but I know it's not healthy for either of us to revisit what we had.

Financially, I'm struggling and rely on my dad for support, which adds another layer of stress. I'm naturally introverted, dealing with emotional turmoil, and often feel lonely. I've been trying to become more independent, exploring freelancing and other skills, but it's been a slow process.

I've also found solace in writing, where I'm working on a book inspired by my life experiences. It's a mix of dark fantasy and dystopian themes, reflecting the challenges and emotions I've faced in my life.

I'm here hoping to connect with supportive people who can relate to what I'm going through. Whether it's advice, support, or just someone to chat with, any interaction would mean a lot to me right now.

Thanks for taking the time to read this."
"Had some exhausting events happen between me and my friend; and although I'm starting to somewhat recover from it, I would still appreciate having someone to talk to, whether it be about what happened with my friend or about anything in general.

if it keeps going this way im not sure how much longer i can hold on

and i really dont want much just someone who is interested enough to carry on a conversation occasionally and maybe exchanged some things about our emotions

So much to figure out. I'm no where near where I want to be. I guess I've kinda been... Pushing through a lot still. Trying to ignore my problems that I can't solve a bit. Doing happy things in hopes that it'll make me happy. And it all works for the most part. I've been happy more than I've been sad
. As much as it sounds like I'm running away from my problems, this is what healing looks like right?
 Accepting that some things that bother you simply can't change and just trying to do your best to carry on despite them. Recognising your problems. Making changes. Striving for that happiness. But it's so exhausting. There are days when you just run out of energy and it all catches up with you all at once and it's so unbearably overwhelming. It makes you feel so awful and... You almost feel like you're back on square one again. You stop and your brain just can't shield you from all that's not happy and you see it and it's just... Too much. Too much pain. Too much sadness. Too much guilt because you've been choosing yourself over others for once. I don't know if anyone can relate to these feelings but... Today is one of those days where it's all just caught up with me. I'm looking at how far I have to go and all that's still wrong and awful around me and in me and I'm so overwhelmed. I guess I'm here because I really just need reassurance and... To know that tomorrow... Or some day in the future that isn't too far away... It'll be happy again

"Im so disappointed in myself. I fucked up I admit it. I didn’t think thoroughly and now I’m in a situation where I’m fucking screwed. In February, I decided I was going to move to Portland to get out of my abusive home and in a city where I don’t have friends. But I didn’t start planning until mid June after I quit my job. I tried to leave asap, my plane ticket is for this Wednesday, but I have no place to live or a job. I reserved a hostel for a week but I’m not too sure of my prospects being high. I stay here, Im unemployed either way. I stay here, I’m either in an abusive home or homeless. I stay here, I’m alone with no support either way.  Theres no winning, I don’t know what to do. I’m so pissed at myself. I should’ve known better. Now I can’t make a fucking decision. I’m considering canceling my ticket and reservation and just staying put until I find a job/interview. I’m from Texas and I just want to leave the southwest region in general. I had my heart set on Portland so hard. I’m just completely lost now and I have no one to talk to.

"I'm 23M, and I just can't think of a way to proceed that doesn't involve damning myself to a life of misery.  

I have a bachelor's degree in psychology and am finishing my master's in mental health counseling, set to graduate next spring.  Everyone's so happy I found an internship, but all I felt was sheer disappointment.  That was the moment I realized I'd secretly been hoping everything would fall through.

At this point, my options are:

I. Do my internship and enter a career that would force me to harm at least one person in the same way I was harmed, violating my core beliefs.*

II. Drop out and find a job that will barely pay my bills using my nearly worthless psychology degree in a job where I'll surely be miserable.**

III. Do nothing and lose my house and starve to death***

IV. Kill myself.****

.....

*I'm referring to mandated reporting for suicidal ideations [US].  I feel this a) proves to clients there truly is nobody they can safely confide in and b) is fundamentally against my philosophical beliefs: everyone deserves the right to die if that's truly what they want, and the fact they're suicidal isn't enough to say they're too irrational to make that decision.  I can get behind forced hospitalization if someone's having a psychotic episode, just experienced horrible trauma, etc.--some sort of situation where they can't make rational decisions.  But what we currently have is messed up, both pragmatically (how many lives have been lost due to suicidal people fearing they can't talk to their providers?) and philosophically.  

**I've quit every job I've had for the same reason--interpersonal conflict.  Specifically, I'm, like most autistic people, bad at dealing with people who aren't following social rules, mainly bossy people.  It gets to me to the point of suicidality, until I end up quitting in an effort for self-preservation.  Thus, I will continue to be miserable in any conventional workplace environment because there will always be that one coworker.  Hence why autistic people tend to end up either unemployed or self-employed. 

***I'm currently unemployed, quit my job as a mental health case manager 3 months ago.  I've been living off savings.  I'd been trying to line up another job, but I didn't find anything, and after a year of looking and becoming increasingly suicidal, I had to quit.  The only way I managed was by drinking myself to sleep every night.  I quit due to a bossy coworker, like usual, as well as just not feeling like my role was meaningful.  I just felt bored and useless, like an afterthought. 

****Really looks like my best option at this point.  Tell me if there's something I'm not seeing, but it seems like I-III would just lead me to this anyway, but I'd have to experience immense suffering and degradation for a few years before I finally got here.  Or I just do it tomorrow and save myself a lot of pain.  Am I being completely irrational with that thought process?  I'm trying so hard to find a reason why that's illogical, and I just can't see it. "
"Please can I have someone to talk too today. I keep hitting my head over and over again. I am so frustrated with my life. I am so frustrated with my self.

"A month or two ago, my grandfather was in the kitchen and suddenly just fell down. He hit his head and started bleeding and was taken to the hospital. 

I’m not sure what his medical conditions are as my family doesn’t really communicate with each other/ have good relationships with one another. He was there in the hospital for about a week before coming home. He stayed in bed a lot and he could walk but with help from my grandmother. He also would get visits from nurses to help clean his wound/ check on him.

Weeks passed and he’s lost control of his bladder as he would wear a tube. He could still walk though with help. He also had to go back to the hospital.

He came back and a few days ago, I saw my grandma crying when speaking on the phone. Last Friday, the nurse said something being very low and him having to go see the doctor. I overheard my grandma saying he couldn’t open his mouth. 

He’s currently at the hospital ( I think) and my grandma has packed up all his stuff (appears to be thrown away). I overheard my dad say the name of the mortuary where we buried my mom. I’m getting the same sad feeling as I did when my dad threw away all my mom’s belongings.

Idk if he’s passed or not or if they’re preparing. My dad and grandma are really the only ones who know about his illness, they’re acting normal but they could just not be expressing their sadness and it’s worrying me. My siblings barely know or understand what’s going on and everyday is acting normal while I’m here so anxious. 

Idk what to do. I didn’t realize it would be so soon. I haven’t even graduated college yet. I just feel so sad and unaccomplished. Wishing I could’ve done more and not knowing how he is. "

I'm doing twice the study load to finish my university early and this wasn't in the planning. I feel like I have disappointed everyone."

"This will be a bit of a longer rant so please bear with me

Note: This post mentions briefly suicidal thoughts 

Recently I’ve been feeling awful, the way the world feels like it’s getting more and more hateful as the days go by is making me lose hope. I should be happy, I recently got into med school after two years of trying but my joy got overran by these immense fear

My suicidal thoughts have made a return, I have never felt so depressed when I’ve seen the news and it’s making me not want to do anything, add to that that I’ve been getting sicker, my IBS (previously dormant or in its previous worst occasions mildly annoying) is running rampant and causing me the most discomfort I’ve ever felt in my life

It feels like all is going wrong, that the life I lead is going to disappear soon and that hateful speech is only growing around the globe, I’m so scared, I don’t know what to do to help ease these feelings and find hope to continue living, I’ve even returned to my faith in hopes of it easing the pain but while it’s been helpful it’s not taking away all the pain in my heart, I just need someone to give me something that can help me restore my faith in humanity and my faith in a better future "
"In a 9 year relationship with many red flags signaling incompatibility that we chose to ignore and try to make work throughout the years. 

But now we can’t deny it any longer- staying with him breaks me up and tears me apart but thinking of being without him makes me want to bear with the pain. I can’t eat and cry all the time. 

I wish desperately with all the pieces of my broken heart that he could be the one to love and respect me in the way that’s important to me, but time and time again he shows that he loves himself far more and cannot be compelled to respect my boundaries and consider my feelings. I am in a hell of pain from his actions but still I wish for him and I wish so badly to stay with him till the end. I wish so much that he could be the person I thought I finally could start to trust. I was so happy in my ignorance, and so pained in my knowledge, yet all I want is still him. Staying hurts and leaving hurts and I truly do not know what to do with myself. "

"I am traveling to Berlin to do an audition recording for new submissions to agencies and opera houses.  I just made it to the city, when I found out that my credit card debt was too far in the red to be excepted. I am trying to live extremely frugally, but with everything that has to come with trying to fucking find a job, it’s almost impossible.

This isn’t Germany to me. It is a hodgepodge of old German, Turkish, Russian, Ukrainian, and the number of other languages I still can’t understand for the bother to deal with right now. 

You see me on the street, carrying my microphone stand and my backpack and my luggage with all my equipment, you might see a bald individual with a really solid face… that’s because I’m autistic, and I am one of the unfortunate ones that has a Wooden face.  Underneath my bald head and my goatee and my expression… I am straight up crying, not wanting to be here! And I’m only here for one purpose in the afternoon, then I’m stuck here until tomorrow morning. The city brings up a lot of good AND bad memories from the first time I ever visited this place in 2019. It wafts over me like a cruel Summer breeze, as if I were in an oven getting my fat ass cooked off in a slow and merciless process

"I'm a 23 years old guy. I'm currently studying in a University.  
I've always been a reserved type of person. As a child, I often turned inward and lived in my own imaginary world. My imagination was so vivid that I didn't even notice what I was doing in real life. I never initiated friendships; it was always others who found me and joined me, and that's how I made my elementary school friends. Only the most serious friendships lasted after I finished elementary school. I didn't see the others anymore. I almost never invited my friends over; they always invited themselves, and I could never say no because I didn't want them to feel bad. I would always hesitate a bit when they came over or invited me, because then I had to be with them, which meant I couldn't play video games alone at home on my computer.

Throughout my life, I was always with those I was in school with. I never really wanted to make friends because I always thought it would just take away my free time, as I couldn't say no to them, and thus what I truly wanted would never happen because I would suppress it within myself.

I had a reserved, quiet side that I showed during lessons, but in afternoon activities, I was much more open, and I felt ashamed when the two sides met. I never dared to change because I was afraid of others' opinions, so I remained the same, but I always longed to be different.

In high school, there were some changes in my clothing and appearance, which I had never dared to do before, but it wasn't much of a change; I remained the same inside.

There were girls I liked, but there was always something about them that made me talk myself out of it, so I never took the first step. There were only a few girls in my life whom I met more frequently, and they were always the ones I liked. It was as if my heart was drawn to them just because I wanted a girlfriend.

When I went to university, I met a girl I liked, but she already had a partner. They had serious issues with each other, so I hoped they would eventually break up. The girl had a troubled background, and I wanted to be the one to bring her happiness. I was a ray of hope for her, showing that there are good men too. We became friends. After a very long time, they broke up, and not long after, I got together with her. I had longed for this, but when it finally happened, I didn't really know what to do with the situation. At first, it was great, but then I started to feel very anxious about it. I didn't want to ruin our friendship, but somehow I didn't feel capable of being a good man for her. I was very uncertain, and she often resented this. She thought I was childish and didn't want to take care of me. We remained friends. I feel that she often criticizes me without reason.

I'm not a determined person. I'm also conflict-averse. I'm afraid of hurting others, and this defines my life. I often suppress my feelings/opinions so as not to hurt someone else. I always think of the worst possible outcome. I don't think much of myself. My EQ is very low, at least according to others. I always compared myself to others because I didn't consider myself a normal person, just below average. What I saw as normal was almost everything I wasn't.

I don't know what to do with myself. I need to change a lot, and I'm trying working on it, but I feel it would be very difficult to reach a level where things would work out with her. I feel she has a hard time understanding me. She's been through much harder things, and so I feel she doesn't see my problems as significant. Sometimes she encourages me to change in small steps and not to be afraid, but if I do something or think something wrong, she scolds me, asking why I'm like this and then I feel like I'm a bad person, but I'm just trying to overcome my inner fears, which might be why I'm unable to think and act normally.

"I am 31 M married I have been married for 9 years with 2 kids under 6, my wife has been messaging an old high school flame in secret, I stumbled across these messages and she initially lied and said it was just platonic but secret, before I pried and she admitted things had gotten out of line somewhat but nothing physical. I am still distraught I’ve been having trouble sleeping, having trouble eating, and most importantly having trouble trusting. Wife admits it was completely inappropriate but expects me to comfort how she feels about her decisions while I’m trying to find comfort in my own feelings about the matter. I could just really use someone to talk to, and I’d be happy to return the favor."

But something was wrong with him, he attacked our livestock, he attacked our neighbor's service dog, he was vicious. I've never experienced something like this before. I put him down after the neighbors declined to call animal services after the attack. I'm ashamed and hurt and so terribly sad. I just want to hear some kindness, please."

I could have been like all my friends and gone to a good college here in Portugal where it's free and everything.

All this because I screwed up in math, I could have gotten a much better grade in math but I made stupid mistakes.

Now I'll have no choice but to stay a year behind everyone else and go back to doing a whole year at school with the younger kids while the others are getting ahead.

Fuck, man, I don't want to spend another year at the damn school putting up with kids while the others are at parties, sports championships and other cool university things.

Maybe I won't be able to get in until I'm almost 30, but if that's the case, no one will hire me and it won't do any good, I'll have to work on the building sites earning minimum wage or less and put up with the Portuguese sun with other school failures."

Hello I know it's been a long time since I have posted on here. A lot has changed. Most for the better. But most importantly I have made some friends that I truly care about and I don't want to loose them. For context two of them are dating and while they don't have the best communication skills and one of them hasn't had the best past in relationships I think they are wonderful for each other and they both love each other dearly. Some times one partner we are going to call her 1 and the other partner call him 2 well sometimes 1 has issues with conflict and sometimes gets over angry and doesn't listen to people well. Which I understood her previous relationship she felt she couldn't speak up or defend herself. But sometimes that causes issues with 2 because he also has a few issues but he too struggles with communication. Well today they had a bit if an argument not a major one a small one and 2 asked me if she truly loves him. And I was like yes she does she just has trouble with her timper and communication that could be because she is still in that mindset of her previous relationship. 2 took that to mean that she still thinks off her ex and I tried to explain what I was meaning but the words I was trying to form weren't what I was meaning to say. I was able to clear it up with him but I an worried he will say something to 1 and she will hate me for it. And that I will no longer have them as my friends. I wasn't trying to hurt their relationship at all I am truly happy for them I am glad they have both found someone who completes them. I hope to one day find a relationship just like theirs. But is there anyone who can help me better work on using the right wording so I hopefully don't mess it up again.

"It's really what the title says. I broke up with her when I was manic and stopped talking to her for a month. I believe she's found someone else and now I'm no longer manic and having to deal with the consequences of all of it. I also have a history of abuse in past relationships. 

It wasn't a perfect relationship as we would argue a lot and things would get out of control. I have a tendency to see slights where there weren't any, or maybe there were. I honestly don't know. I have a therapist but I don't see her again until wednesday morning. I'd love to chat with someone and maybe get my mind off of everything. Just get my thoughts out and maybe I can help you too. I left my old job when my manic phase hit and just kind of went crazy. 

For a long time I was supporting her and she's still asking for money occasionally to help pay her rent but otherwise completely ignoring me. She keeps telling me that it's just a break, and that she's not gone but I feel lost and alone. Anyone willing to Voice chat would be awesome but text would also work as well. I have discord and I could always use more friends on there. 

I have been tempted to reach out on here before but haven't. Tonight, I called out of my new job because I just couldn't get my head clear of all that's going on and I have a pit in the bottom of my stomach every time my mind wanders to her, and it seems to do that every few minutes. Everything reminds me of her. I know I was terrible in the relationship sometimes but I think I did my best most of the time. Now, it's over and I'm just so lost. "

I screamed at the top of my lungs, stop, just stop. I can't take this anymore. And then she yelled at me to stop screaming, and that I'm over reacting.. She never has been that supportive of me. She tries, but she doesn't try hard enough. I just need someone who is kind to tell me that everything's gonna be OK and that I'm not over reacting. I feel like I can't let  my emotions out around her because all she's gonna say is that I'm over reacting and I need to stop giving her attitude."
"i'm miku, 23, neurodivergent person from romania with a pretty painful past and bad mental health, but slowly healing, at least that's what i like to think

"Hey (22 M) i did some deplorable and disgusting things to people i loved  (girlfriends) there was no physical harm such as SA or stuff like that, but i hurt them anyway and i can't live with that today.

 i'am seeing a psychatrist because i want to deal with all the things i've done and all the things that happened to me during my childhood. I want to become a better man, a good man, achieve redemption and never hurt anyone the way i hurt them. I am willing to work on myself, put some effort in the process, but changing won't erase what i did. Becoming a good person won't make the people i hurt forget about what i did, they won't be feeling better. 

i can't deal with that, i spend all my time thinking about what i did and the way they felt when when they found out about my horrible deeds. i know i'll be caring that for the rest of my life and i can't stand those thoughts. I thought about ending it, killing myself so I wouldn’t have to think about my past, but i know i'll be causing even more pain. 

i'am stuck and i dont know what to do."
"This is probably my fifth post or so on here about my loneliness already, but I just want to open up more about it.

Throughout my life, I've faced rejection in some way. People would avoid me at all costs, and when I did find people I considered friends, they showed their true colors shortly after. When I was 15, I once had a platonic friendship with a girl, and she cared about me a lot, but over the months, I was feeling unwelcome and unequal in her group, and I questioned the friendship, which led to arguments, and me getting death threats from her boyfriend.

I honestly feel like I'll never find lasting connections, whether it be friendships or relationships. I cried an hour ago, because I was questioning who I am as a person, and if I'm even good enough for human connection, despite how kind I am to others. I feel like I don't belong on this earth, because of my past experiences with others.

I blame my flaws for being the reason I'm in this situation, sometimes I blame other people. In the end, I barely find anyone who's actually kind, and I feel like an alien because I'm not like them, but I don't want to sacrifice my own values for friendship. 

Thank you for reading. Any kind words are appreciated dearly. Much love to all of you.

"I've longed for my high school Graduation ever since I can remember, but not for the reasons some may think. I never thought about the end of school, or the partying and presents, I associated graduation with my relatives; **that they would finally visit.** 

I have previously posted on this sub-reddit about my extended family, and how they live 7 hours from me thus I rarely visit- but we do make that long trip sometimes (more so in the past)! They have never in my 19 years of existence been in my town and visited, which is sad but understandable- we only made the drive on **special** occasions like Christmas, a week on the summer holidays, and **graduations...** so I knew why they didn't. But me and my sister have always known that when we graduate, they will finally come south and celebrate- cuz that is what relatives do right? Even thought me and my cousins are not close and far apart in age- I came to theirs? And I've grown up with my aunt and uncle... they wouldn't miss it right?

They are not coming. My cousins have too much at work, that's ok I was not sure they would come either way... My aunt and her husband are in disputes right now and he feel pressured from all angles, I really like him but I get his situation... My uncle is in financial troubles and don't have the money to come.. ok... I get it... And my aunt don't want to come alone- it will cost her 2000 kr (185 usd)... 

I was in disbelief when my mom told me an hour ago, especially because they had told me before hand that they all would come... and now they can't? I'm starting to cry again haha. I have mentioned in previous posts that I don't have a large family, my dad has no one and my mom has these people, so the probability that someone can't come is inevitable... but they don't make the effort to come either. They prioritize other things which means my graduation was not that important. I don't blame my cousins that much, work could get in the way, but my aunt? She can come, she just... doesn't want to... My years of anticipation for them to come was shattered just now, and they really couldn't care. 

I think I am more sad over them not making the trip to celebrate me, than me not seeing them. I associated graduation with them finally coming down here and now that is not happening. I have never in my life felt so disappointed. They would finally acknowledge me, I would finally get to see my relatives acknowledge me as part of them, but no. I went to my cousins graduations and weddings... This was the only thing I wanted from them. 

But, I lied a bit in the beginning, I have some relatives coming- my other uncle and his wife. I am forever grateful for them, they see the need and joy to celebrate me. I have family friends coming, and friends to myself- the amount is not what I am worried about... but the fact that my relatives did not show up. This discovery has made me question my relationship to, especially, my aunt. I feel like she betrayed me by this, that I don't want to associate myself with her, or anyone else for that matter. This was my dream, what I had talked about for years- ""When I graduate you will come down"" ""My relatives will finally come down now for my graduation""... now its instead a disappointment and sad event that I can't forgive.

Life doesn't make any sense to me. I want something that lasts and I'm tired of losing people. Nothing makes any sense in this world.
"Hello, everyone. I want to say that I prefer not to write out all the details of the break up on here. Perhaps I can talk in more detail about it on Reddit chat. I've been with my partner for over a year and things have been building up in a negative sense. We had an argument prior over the same situation, and things clearly did not change. It all just seemed like I wasn't worth it to them. I tried. I really did. It felt like all my efforts were wasted and yet they come off without any emotion.

After some discoveries, things went downhill. They did not want to even admit what they did, and even tried to turn it on me as if I was crazy and everything was fine. They aren't broken up about it, but I have to be? I'm sure they are already planning on moving on. 

Thank you for everyone here. I am sorry if I have to drop this all on here. It is something many of us deal with and I know I'm not special."
"I’m so sorry for the length but please be patient with me, I am so desperate for any help. I have some health issues and suffer with severe depression, ADHD, and severe anxiety. I left high school due to mental health and have been the primary caretaker for my severely disabled sister ever since. I eventually developed autoimmune issues and I was also diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I’m 24 and still haven’t completed highschool because of my anxiety. I desperately want to finish highschool, I have 5 courses left but can’t find the motivation to finish them at all. I haven’t had a support system as I stopped talking to all of my friends in highschool and haven’t made any since. I haven’t dated or talked to many people in general. My parents aren’t very present, they provide shelter and necessities for me and I am very grateful for that. They like that I am willing to devote all of my time towards taking care of my sister. My parents are not willing care for my sister and have only kept her at home in order to collect disability benefits on her behalf. They called me ‘the normal one’ and would make comments about how I care too much for her, and make sick comments like ‘taking care of my catatonic sister has rendered me equally useless to society too’. When I was in highschool she became extremely sick and eventually developed bedsores, was left to sit in her own filthy diapers for days, was never bathed, and was rarely fed well or given her medications on time. Her condition deteriorated due to the neglect and my anxiety started to revolve around losing my sister. My parents wanted to send her to a care home because of her deteriorating health and I was severely depressed over this. I stopped attending highschool because I was scared they would send her away when I was gone (they have threatened to do that many times before. It’s why I’m afraid to ever leave her in their care). My parents have prevented me from receiving mental help by threatening to kick me out. They have temporarily kicked me out in highschool because I saw a psychiatrist. They have greatly enabled my sedentary lifestyle because they believe I will take care of them when they are older. They have recently started to be more cruel to my sister (verbally/emotionally) and are looking into care facilities. They said ‘she will only be a burden on me when the time comes for me to be their caretaker’. They told me they intend to send her to a care home within the next 5 years (in time for my father’s retirement). I love my sister to death and all I want is to go to university and get a good job in order to provide for her and give her a good life. I want to move out after school and take my sister with me, but I can only do this if I’m able to get a decent job. Her life expectancy is until about 30 and it breaks my heart to think about. I feel guilty for having wasted so much time, for not having made a career path or plan at all. I’m embarrassed to not have completed highschool. I feel like a bad sister for not prioritizing my own future enough to be able to give my sister a better life. 

I have no work experience and no really valuable/applicable skills. I never expected to be alive past the age of 16, I only stuck it out for my sister. She doesn’t have anyone else but me. I have no idea what to do. I’m secretly starting therapy soon with money I have saved up. I enrolled in online highschool as well, but I need help on how to find motivation. I get so much anxiety when I look at the courses because they are so mundane and yet I still haven’t completed them. I also want to mention that I’m not entirely dumb despite all of this. I have interests in philosophy, I read a lot of classical literature and epic novels. I like law, pharmacology and urban planning. I have studied things on my own and I know I can do well in university. It just kills me that I haven’t been able to complete the bare minimum education wise, and that’s the depressive cycle I’ve been stuck in. I don’t know what I can do with my life at this point? Is it possible to get a good job ever in my life with this gap on my resume? Will anyone ever employ me after this? What kind of therapy or mental help should I be getting? If I worked and went to university I will try to get a part time caretaker for my sister. Will universities even accept me? Is there any way to convince a university that my applications are even worth consideration? Are there any mental health professionals that you can recommend? Anyone that has dealt with patients in similar situations, would be willing to help me, or write a letter to a university vouching for me?

Sorry that this is really long, I haven’t had anyone to talk to in a long, long time. I feel so alone and scared about not knowing what could happen to my sister if I don’t get my life together. I would really greatly appreciate any help I can get. "
"I lost my dad about a month ago. I've been trying to be there for my mom but I can't take it anymore. I tried really hard on helping her plan his funeral but because she's in charge of it and has the money for it, it has been hard. After a lot of back and forth she finally set a date for June. I'm angry and frustrated because I can't believe how long she delayed everything. "
"I’m tired of thinking “well maybe if I focus on the gym and blah blah blah and make myself look better people will like me.” In a perfect world, you should just focus on basic hygiene and you won’t be judge for your appearance. But I feel like that’s not the case. I am shy but I have a kind soul. Although I think people would rather be with some bully than a nice person just because this bully is insanely attractive. It’s not fair. I don’t want to whine on Reddit. I want to meet new people in real life and better myself. I don’t want to be a lazy bum with a grim view on society."
Is there anyone here I can talk to? I feel so alone right now.
"It’s hard for me to cry when I know I need to. Listening to music more emboldens any painful feelings I have. However, short clips of random acts of kindness, people validating your feelings, people showing vulnerability, people talking about their healing, people being strong in tough times, etc. often bring the tears I need while also giving me a sense of self-compassion. I’d love links to any clips or playlists or accounts of short clips of this kind."
"This went pretty well last time so wanted to go again.

Just wanted to offer incase anyone needs someone to listen. Of course, I'm not medical or therapist but I'm willing to listen to your problems even if I don't have any good answers for you. Hope you all are having a good day, try and hang in there. Just send something on reddit if you're looking for someone to listen, no judgement here.

Or if you just want to talk about nothing at all and just chat, feel free."
"This is a job that I’m absolutely miserable in. It involves heavy sales, almost door-to-door and very in your face, and my anxiety has gotten so bad in the 120 days I’ve been in this role. It’s so bad, it triggered my autoimmune illness to a point where I’m now on medication for it. 

I joined the company/role because I went in thinking it was going to be like my last job, but received a rude awakening when it turned out to be something completely different and a total nightmare. I was also in a desperate spot and took it more for the steady paycheck and benefits. 

I’ve tried to make it work despite it making me sick, but today I was sprung with an Annual Review and was told that I have 30 days to shape up or they’re letting me go. 

I ended up admitting to my bosses that this job isn’t a fit for me and that I’ve been looking for something else but still giving everything I got in this current role. They appreciated the honesty, but I still feel like a failure. I’ve never had this happen to me in my professional career. 

I know what I need to do and I’m aggressively applying to anything that can get me out of this company. Right now, I’m just numb and hurting.

Its Been rough lately. M'y self esteem is at an all Time low. I feel no motivation and full of anxiety.
"I'm having bad thoughts... I don't know if life can go any worse I hope not. Please let me know in message if you are comfortable with hearing bad thoughts or else I can just talk about the pain. I donno what to do. When will life give me a break, it's been over a decade😭 please."
"I feel like I can’t speak when it comes to the point of my self and my emotions when someone knows me. I’ve talked to a therapist and I know what I am likely upset about and I know what haunts me… but I feel like whenever I try and say it a massive weight is placed on my very soul and I just freez up.

I am trying to get over this because there is someone I love very much (I have not told them and we are just friends) and if I do not tell them within a year they will be gone for ever and I won’t be able to tell them how I feel. And that is why the first paragraph is so important. I bottle up all of my emotions and the lid is on so strong that I can’t get anything out."
"We can talk about anything, vent, distract small talk, and read. Anything you want, I am here for you. You are not alone."
I have a wide variety of knowledge only Myriad of topics willing to listen if you're going through an overwhelming situation. If you have a challenge in front of you and you just need to talk things through or if you just need someone to distract you from feeling overwhelmed I'd be more than happy to hop on a voice call. I help people problem solve in my daily life and would love to offer to be a safe space for someone needing A New Perspective please be over the age of 18 and based in the US thank you
"So I’ve been feeling down these past few days for some reason. The feeling doesn’t stick forever, but it just seemingly lingers on and it makes me feel anxious and down. I’ve tried talking and doing stuff to distract, but it only helps for a bit until these feelings kick back. It’s making me think things that I don’t want to think about. I figured I’d try asking someone here since it’s better to have someone to talk with."
"As of recent one of my friends is, having issues with motivation for studying in college and I don't know completely how. Well, I guess I do I also just, would like assistance? More so I can balance this easier, assuming things come up out of my control. More minds are better, as there are chances in the future I could be busy and I don't want things to happen that I can't have be handled by someone reliable."
"I had a suicide attempt a month ago and I'm still in treatment. I'm feeling better, but my meds are still fucked up. But I still have this urge to have a ""contingency plan"" just in case the ideations come back full force. So I found one of my partners guns and took it without their knowledge. And hid it away. And then lied about it-twice- when they noticed it was missing. I feel guilty for keeping it, I feel guilty for lying about it, but it's almost like I crave it. I need to have my escape plan to feel safe? Wtf. What do I do?"
My depression has been getting worse lately:((

"I’ll try to keep it short or else my crackhead brain will  just rant on…. Putting it up here first…. I’m  a loser and a fuck up who couldn’t keep a good woman in my life when things were good. Worst when it got bad I steadily let it get worse.   So I heartedly accept having to live with this… crawling. Yearning to fight for the missing part of my soul…  And I’m a fighter! I don’t give up and never want to….  


It’s different this time around because she expressed clearly her boundaries “AS Friends” is where she’d like to label us as she needs black and white clear convictions.  No sex and nothing relationship type. And she’ll always be there for me . Normally I don’t roll over easily, not ever,  
But I’m really coming into perspective and am well aware of house much I hurt her and how many lines  I crossed along with much she gave herself to me. So at the very least I  will put my soul into repeating her not only as the wonder she is but her wishes and boundaries.  
I die inside day by day  her I miss her voice, her touch , Her big brown eyes . And the warm knowing her presses always near. So I don’t wanna to contact everyone emotional swing I go through, and ranting dumb shit because I can’t say how I really feel. She’s been doing so much better and I’m sinking lower and lower day by day know that I can’t be selfish and the best way I can help is to let her thrive  


We meet up for  a movie few days ago and it like first day when I  met her, joyful to say the least, hugged goodbye but I still really never wanted to let go. I felt my convictions confirmed when she had told me she’s meeting up people at.concert venue. Something wed always do together.  
I had good news today and the only person I can think of or even want to tell is her.  But I’m too emotional and know I’ll break… this is never like me . But this Time around it ain’t about me . Tell me I’m doing right by her. I’d sufffer lifetimes if it means her happiness . I will always love her i wont stop and if this is my punishment, ill live with it for her ......Some one . Anyone"

"In 2021, my step sister and I rescued three dogs, and my stepmom and dad allowed me to keep one of them, leading to a bond with the dog over the next three years. I live with my mom and visit my dad during summers and holidays, but my dog couldn't come with me due to size and living in an apartment. In October 2023, I had a chance for my dog to live with me and my mom. I asked my stepmom, who the dog is registered under, for permission. She texted me saying she would talk to my dad and get back to me. After no response, I texted my dad a few days later about the situation and how I would like for my dog to be able to come with me wherever. My dad insisted on a family discussion and accused me of disrespect, although I was just seeking a solution. He eventually suggested a contract, but my mom disagreed as the dog needed to be registered under her for vet visits. My dad and stepmom neglected the dog's healthcare due to cost, preventing her from living with me. Recently, my dad got upset when my mom contacted him about my drop-off arrangements instead of me. A day later my phone was being slow and all my texts came in late. My step sister had texted me earlier and I apologize saying my phone was acting up. She then texted me saying I needed to talk to my dad because he would get me a new phone when I come visit, but I wasn't allowed to visit until I texted him because we haven't texted in a while. However, I want my dog and I don't want her to be with them due to his behavior and concerns about my dog's well-being at their home. As a minor, I feel conflicted about the situation and seek advice on how to handle it."
"I'm mostly free today but will be quite busy tomorrow, I'm from GMT +3 timezone by the way.

This probably won't be the best intro for a text that is written to find people to talk with, but I feel the need to be honest: I've actually talked about the topic I want to talk with you a number of times(probably more) with other people from Reddit and there is not much you can do to help me at the moment.

I want to talk about it regardless of these two conditions, that is if someone else wants to talk as well, probably in order to be able to get it out of my system and organize the jumbled up thoughts in my head; but probably also to feel supported, less alone as well.

I'm still not sure how I can describe it, but my problems have gotten a lot bigger since they started or I've just realized how vast they are only recently. I just want to talk about my problems again after confrontint/seeing the bigger picture. And I would really appreciate the company of someone kind as well.

And I would like to talk from DM, if you are comfortable with it as well. I just don't like the feeling that everyone can watch and see what is being talked, it keeps me on attack all the time, I can't stop myself from getting nervous.

I should probably state what I wanna talk about so this doesn't look like an empty post: some of recent main topics briefly are rapid loss of friends, medical problems, uncertainty about future and social and romantic insufficiency.

"See, I am someone who is ""over"" forgiving. I also put other before myself. That is why, when I am with the good people around me, I offer them the best time of their life. But the problem is, sometimes they do mistakes, and when I talk about it, they start to blame me. I try to see my negative actions and theirs, but I feel that they only think about mine. They also get annoyed when I tell them they hurt my feelings, and they start to tell me how I am a negative person etc,, eventhough I ignore my needs most of the time. I am a people pleaser, does that means I should suffer of lack of attention? "
I would like to try out therapy for some issues I am having.

"Hi guys! I'm a 36-year-old man. I had surgery awhile back and I'm having a hard time leaving my apartment after getting used to being so isolated. I had one friend that I talked to daily, but I found out yesterday that she was gaslighting me in a big way and spreading rumors about me in a community we're both part of. I play online text-based games, called MUDs, which is where I got the recommendation to come here. Just hoping to chat with someone for a little while, to keep what sociality I have."
Stoic at breaking point here. I can just about guarantee you haven't heard a premises like what I'm dealing with if that encourages your decision to hmu or not. Just need anyone to hear out what I'm dealing with and maybe drop an opinion on the matter? Any and/or everyone welcome to help. 
"I've been having a hard time, mentally, for quite some time now. I generally get by, but there are ups and downs, of course. I'm not even sure what to write here. Might just vent a bit.

My mood has been varying wildly. From okay enough the other day, to deeply depressed yesterday, to seething anger today. I feel especially sick of it all today. So sick of this house, the way my father treats my mother, the blatant lack of care he shows despite literally being her legal caregiver (which he insisted on, of course).

I've been working on myself and have been making a genuine effort to address the issues here, but shit takes time, despite my impatience, and drives me slightly mad.

I try to focus on other positives or wins. Like, I'm objectively doing better now than I have done for years. Arguably ever. I'm being more outgoing and social than I've been in nigh on a decade (which still isn't much, but still!), more proactive, overall nicer to myself. But, idk how to put it; I guess part of me feels it isn't enough, or it's all too little, too late?

Thank you for reading my rambly vent, I'm not entirely sure what I'm aiming to achieve with this, but some kind of kind voice would indeed be appreciated."
"Something inside me shattered today. I’ve just been kind of coasting along the past few weeks, not really doing well but also not doing “above average” either.
But today it felt like I just regressed several months in terms of my mental health at the flick of the wrist, and it feels so deep and dark like a vacuum but it strangely feels like I’m supposed to be here and not try to leave because I just end up hurting myself or others whenever I try to become better.

It sucks and I feel like I lost a piece of myself that I’ll never get back."
I just left my PhD program due to mental health issues and have been working at Walmart for a month. Tomorrow I start a new teaching job.

"Got high with two work friends of mine today. I'm new to it and inhaled what too much out of a vape device. I threw up all of the food I had in front of then and it landed on some of their stuff. It was so disgusting and I looked awful.  They waited a few hours with me until I was better but it was so hard to do anything and I was also unresponsive. Sister came home later and helped me get myself back together but they had to leave at some point. As the title implies, I am just really embarrassed about it and need process it.

"I'm struggling quite a bit with my mental health lately. I'm not even depressed anymore, really, but I do feel a very frequent pang of falling short.

I couldn't even do that two years ago so that's a massive fucking win. 

But then there are all the things I'm missing, like close friendships and a relationship, life experience in those areas, and I'm reminded of what I'm missing so often it takes me out of my flow for at least 2-3 days a week. I wish change came faster. I'll be turning 26 in a month and I'm still waiting for my life to really start, still very complacent. Every day that goes by that I'm not actively working on making friends, meeting new people, finding a partner, building a life for myself feels like another hit to the gut.

"I have been struggling to meet people socially who are not coworkers. I have just been diagnosed with social anxiety, and my therapist suggested I do exposure therapy. Basically, I have to put myself in situations that would create slight anxiety, so I can overcome them. One of the tasks I need to do is to talk to strangers for about 5 minutes. I have casual topics/questions prepared, so there will always be something to talk about. We can communicate through Instagram, Facebook messenger, or whatever medium you choose.

"I’m just in a very bad place mentally - I feel high anxiety nearly constantly, and I always feel like I’m about to vomit

There’s so many reasons why, but recently it is just because of how lonely I feel

I’m 23. I am pretty good at socializing and I get along with others well. I have many hobbies. That being said, I can’t seem to make real relationships. Literally my entire life. And now i have nobody. No family, only superficial relationships, and an unreciprocated romance

I don’t really understand it. I am a good friend. Whenever they’ve been in need, I drop everything I’m doing and do my utmost to help them. I’m kind and supportive. I put forward effort to make sure everyone is included and having fun. Yet none of it is ever returned towards me. I’m treated with minimal respect, and never helped, nor connected with. When my “friends” contact me, it is always if they need something. Never just seeking to hang out or check in. I don’t understand why

The same goes for romantic relationships. Recently I met a girl and we got along well. We slept together (which she initiated), cuddled, spent every hour for the better part of two weeks together, etc. Everything is going fine, and then suddenly I’m being ghosted, lied to, and disrespected. I don’t understand why. Not even a little. I treated her so well, noticing all the little things, surprising her at every turn, helping her whenever she asked, etc. How was I treated in return? With unexplained, curt messages drench in ambiguity and deception. Being left on read for several days at a time

And yet it’s so hard for me to move on, because I have literally nobody. I’m grasping at straws, and I don’t understand why. I just want someone to love me even 50% of how much I love them :(

I know for a fact that if I died, it would likely be several months to years before anyone noticed. It’s so tiring"
I was recently hospitalized for my mental health after having a bunch of toxic friendships. I just finished php and recently transitioned to iop and I don’t like it.

My first few days transitioning back were pretty bad with a teacher figuring out part of what happened even though I didn’t want them to. I was also shoved into a table of girls that don’t like me and I don’t like them because my guidance counselor didn’t want me eating alone even though I didn’t have a problem with it. I do have friends at school but none of them are in my lunch. I was introduced to a nice girl though so that’s not a problem anymore. My friends haven’t been responding to me and I’m pretty sure my ex turned them against me. Or maybe they’re just annoyed with me idk. My parents are mad at me because I didn’t put my clothes away. Ik I should do it but I’ve had no motivation. It doesn’t help that my mom’s been yelling at me all day. I called my dad on the verge of tears asking him when he was coming home from band rehearsal and he said he was getting dinner with them. I didn’t care that he was at rehearsal but I was pretty upset that he didn’t want to come home after. He wasn’t paying for dinner or anything like that he was just going. I hate how he always picks his band over me. He always picks our dog over me too. He fed her but was getting annoyed with me because I didn’t have my clothes done but I also hadn’t eaten since 10 (it was a little after 5) (and I’m still recovering from an ed) but he wanted me to get them done before dinner. Eventually he let me have dinner but I still think that was rude. Then he saw a scar on me from before I was hospitalized and kept asking me about it even though I told him it was old. Then he called my mom in because he didn’t believe me. It was really triggering for me. It’s just been a bad week so if anyone wants to talk that’d be cool.
For anyone who needs someone to talk too I’m here feel free to message me
"I wish I knew what to write.

I grew up not so good (read chlldhood abuse) and lack of info just sends me into a tailspin. My parents never contact me except for my Birthday… and sometimes not always Christmas. IRL there’s not much for people that care about me, I’m always the first to reach out. No one calls for me, no one cares.

I have a boyfriend, but he likes to change plans last minute or tries to change other plans I already committed to. I’m not sure if he thinks he is helping so I am still able to do the other thing. I just want honesty. I wish I could just trust people. I want to so badly and I keep trying. He hasn’t done anything wrong per se, but I know I’m trying to protect myself from being hurt. I know no one owes me anything, but the hurt will remain.

Once I felt I was abandoned by someone out of nowhere and I had no supports that I could trust… and I wasn’t the same. It broke me. I’m scared of that happening again. 

I remind myself I have things that will help me, like resources, that I didn’t have before. Connections are hard to make IRL - because of my trauma I’m seen if I tell some people, a walking red flag. I have so much baggage. My own parents didn’t accept me and love me… why would anyone else?

Anyways, thanks for reading."
"hello everyone 

It's late at night and I can't sleep, a misdiagnosis gave me a health scare and lead me to reorganize my priorities and to believe that my purpose in life is spreading kindness and compassion, so here I am! 


Feel free to DM me with what's on your mind and I'll reply when I see it 


You are important, worthy of love, and you matter ❤️"
"Disclaimer, I struggle with mental health problems a lot.

When I get stressed out I get angry out of nowhere and I just want to hit everything I see. Sometimes I discociate from reality and just hit and yell like a kid :( I'm ashamed about it. I feel like I'm a danger to everyone around me. I need tips"
"Feeling lonely. All my life I’ve wanted to be in love and I’ve never gotten there yet, but lately it hurts a little more than usual.

I love reading romance books but I can’t read them anymore because i feel a sense of longing for that type of love. I can’t even listen to love songs anymore. It just really makes me wonder if I’ll ever find love (and i mean true real love, like the happily ever after kind). I long to know how the little things feel and to share all the moments of your life with a special person.

I know the obvious answers would be to get out and find someone or just deal with being alone. But i guess its just the reassurance part I’d like to hear, that it will or could happen to me (as it does to most of the world), and that I’m probably just being silly and dramatic."
"i wish i didn’t annoy my bf as bad as i do. i feel like i always say all the wrong things. it doesn’t make anything better when im quiet either because he thinks im mad or sad but im not, im just enjoying my time with him and thinking about what im going to say. feels weird to carefully think out every thought but you still say the wrong things. i miss when we used to sing in the car together and he used to actually like some of the songs i showed him instead of not giving anything a chance. or when he used to pick me up all the time, i bus to see him a lot. i just want our relationship to be strong but january really fucked everything up. i’m worried we’re never going to be how we were before. he’s a completely different person and i still love him even though he’s changed so much. i worry he doesn’t love me though. i’ll stay by his side always and support him. i’m trying to do better for myself since im so reliant on him and relationships/friendships in general. i’m not going to be prepared for anything that happens next and i know it. i’m barely even thinking about what im typing i just want to feel better. i want to feel protected and loved and i want to take care of someone who i know will always protect me. i want to protect him too. he said he’s super invested in spirituality and he’s found so many new interests like he made this ai website that acts like accessible free therapy and he’s recently made a story which was really cool. he will sometimes work days straight at his computer nowadays on these projects, basically completely ignoring me. it’s a fight to get him to literally go outside with me now when we used to go on walks all the time. i’ve never seen someone change so fast. he always talks about his new perception of time and levels of consciousness CONSTANTLY. he insists he isn’t crazy and i don’t think he is either i just don’t know what this even means for our future. he said this change is temporarily and it’s healing him but i feel selfish because it’s hurting me bad."
"hi i’m new on reddit but i wanted to share my story to get an external advice (i’m not english so if there are some mistakes, that’s why ;))

my ex (21M) and i (19F) have been together for 3 years, we broke up one year ago. 
our relationship wasn’t the healthiest but i was deeply deeply in love with him and we nearly never argued. had a unique chemistry and lots of fun. through time he lost feelings, broke up with me bc he fell in love with another girl and left me really heartbroken. 

i went to therapy and stopped all communication with him and after some harsh months, the pain went away. not completely, but most of it. 
while i was working on myself he ended up in a terribly toxic relationship with the girl, who still to this day abuses him psychologically and physically.
needless to say that she hates me and i’m worried for him, even if we just talked on the phone twice since we broke up. 

he cut contacts with most of my friends, also bc his gf wont allow him to text them. 
on the other side, i maintained friendships with his friends and family eventually becoming even more attached to them. they are some of the most important people in my life and since our breakup they showed me so much love and loyalty. i’m italian and he’s from the south, so if you dont know, here family (especially parents) and friends have a really tight “lifelong” bond.

i moved out to another country this year and his friends and brothers came to see me.
its been a while since I’ve felt like being 100% over him, but hanging out with them made me incredibly sad and nostalgic out of nowhere. i started thinking that maybe i kept them close to me for all this time just to be somehow inconsciously close to my ex as well. 

I realized that maybe his friends and I grew apart (like suddenly i feel so much different from them)and that sometimes i kept on contacting them just for my ex, while they truly care about me. 
in either case, i’m trying to create new memories with them but i inevitably feel sad / that something is missing most of the times we see each other. 

i still dont know if i can picture any form of friendship with my ex, even if that would probably make “peace” and some sort of closure/new beginning to this situation. i will always see him as both the guy that i loved the most and the one for whom i suffered more than all the others. I keep him blocked on everything and he tried to contact me some times and the two times we talked on the phone were really nice, we love talking to each other. 
his gf wont let him talk to me in any way and his family is still super attached to mine tho. 

thoughts? what do you think?should i cut off his friends and family or should i just take some distance?
is it okay to feel this way even after you move on?

tysm to anyone replying🤍🤍 wishing everyone the best xxx"
"Hello people, 18 year old female here. Something that has made me feel empty recently is my lack of extended family, and I need some- idk- reassurance or smth. I want to get it out of my chest. 

Ok so to get it out of the way, here is what is left of my family. I never met my grandfather on my mother side (he died when my mom was 16), and my grand mother (m-side) died in 2021. My dad is adopted, we don't know his bio dad and we have only met his bio mom once (she is mentally ill, but still alive). His adopted mom died when he was 20 I think, and his adopted dad died in 2017, I think. My mom has 3 siblings (two have 2 children), but all live 7 hours and we never meet them. My dad has an adoptive sister but they don't talk at all, even though we live in the same city. Left is my mom, dad and sister. 

And that's it. I have never met my moms cousins or other extended family. And I know, there are people but I lack their interaction. I can't have a conversation with my cousins without it being awkward, and I meet them maybe every 3 years. 

What makes me sad is that I will not have extended family at my wedding. Maybe my aunts and uncles will come, but not my cousins. I don't have grandparents anymore. Everyone else around me has grandparents they can go home to, cousins they celebrate Christmas with, relatives who come to their graduation. I feel like I am missing out. And that's not the only thing. 

My dad's side is a mystery. We don't know where his dad is or where he is from, not even if he is dead. And he has a mom, which we know is in a city not long from here but she is to unstable to be around. I could have relatives in the middle east (cuz dad's DNA test says he is from there somewhere), a connection I lack because of this. And Imagine how my dad feels, he has no one. 

So I am sad, it feels unfair to miss out on that experience. I am happy with my family yes, but them being divorced makes this even harder. Especially seeing my dad, alone in this world now. And I lack a cultural connection to a part (25 % to be exact haha) of me that I will not find. It's bittersweet"
"I’m about to graduate from uni and I feel like my whole life is a mess. I know it’s normal to feel this but what the hell am I supposed to do now? I’m living in a different country than I was raised in, and despite this being my passport country, I don’t belong here. But I also don’t belong in the country I grew up in. Academic progress has given me most of my validation for my whole life, and I don’t know who I am without it. I don’t know what I’m doing and I don’t feel ready to be an actual adult. I’m just afraid that my life has no real meaning if I’m not doing something that could make a difference.

I just feel so lost and confused :("
"I’m getting through my worst month yet. I’m (M)23 and just have such little direction on my future. It’s week 4 of my classes my senior year of college and I just cannot get through. I have so many personal problems that I am not in a place mentally to finish my degree when I can’t let myself give the effort required. I’ve tried my hardest to adjust my perspective but I can’t let go of the weight and shame I carry everyday. I briefly saw an awesome girl who I fumbled badly. From her wanting to make plans to see me and her reaching out all the time to her not responding anymore to my texts. Another failed romance and the number just keeps pulling up and I keep giving my best.

I’m a 18m in college at a school I am actively trying to transfer from for next year. I’m just not happy here at all. I chose to go here because I had a scholarship but it’s not full , it excludes room and board. I wish I chose a different school to go to. There’s never anything to do here, I feel like I’m moping around all the time, and lately I especially haven’t been feeling like myself. I dread getting out of bed, I’m extremely stressed, get down on myself easily , and I just don’t have motivation for anything. The school I’m trying to transfer to is a little more expensive but I’m hoping as a transfer with good grades I can get some scholarship money— besides that, my real problem lies in how I can talk to my parents about it. My dad is more supportive about it, as long as I do my research on the school, but my mom, being an alumni from my current school, doesn’t want me to leave. It feels impossible to talk to her about me transferring . She knows I want to but she just brushes it off every time I try, and it’s frustrating because I don’t want to stay at a school I’m not necessarily happy at. I feel like everyone else is able to branch out and go other places for college and stuff but I just can’t. Any advice?"
"Ok. So I am 21 years old and I live with my mom and sibling. 

I recently got back in school so i been quite busy. My mom works a lot and my sibling also been in school.

Bear with me. first off, i feel like I want to move out on my own but I can not make a decision. 

Reason why is because I feel like I would do better on my own then to live with my mom and sibling.

Starting with my mom. When i got my job last summer, I felt like at first i did not want to just give her money because she would spend it on anything and not use it reasonably. So i came up with a plan to budget my pay with her pay, but it ended up with me just giving her some of money every time i get paid. She would just randomly just ask me for money and would try to avoid telling what's it for. Sometimes it would be truth and sometimes it would be a lie. I could not tell after a while. she also would not tell me her paycheck, but i stop asking cause i felt bad for asking for that.

As time went on, I brought her a lot of things. I felt like to me I was trying to find some validation because how i was raised. 

My whole life i felt like i had to prove something so I tried to listen to everything my parents say. But that left me unhappy and my parents focused more on my other siblings and had high expectations for me. They help out my other siblings and I kinda had to figure things out myself. 

So I tried to become independent and to myself growing up. My family members would make me mad sometimes and when i would get mad at them, they say I hold grudges. I could never get mad at them because they would think i am going to far.

Fast forward now, My mom still pay attention to my older siblings and it kinda makes me a little mad. Reasons because Im the only one helping her out and she chooses to be closer to the other siblings who does not live here. But she still has responsibilities she wants me to do on my own.

the one sibling thats here with me and mom is fine. We have ups and downs but i feel like our relationship would be better if i leave.

I know this is a lot and I kinda know my answer but I feel so guilty right now. I know I should just leave. I just want to know if Im a rude person if feel a little mad about everything.

Reach out anytime. You are special to me. 
"Throwaway account. I posted here because…well. It sort of feels like that’s what I need. I would especially appreciate advice from people who are aged 35+.

  
I’m a bisexual person in my thirties. I should start by saying I’m incredibly lucky. I left my home country (USA) when I was 21 and managed to build a rewarding life very far away. (I even have a retirement fund now…I’m a real grown-up, you guys!)

  
I just didn’t anticipate how painful it would be to reach my thirties without a family.

  
I always wanted to be married young. More importantly, I always wanted to have children. (At one point, my job involved working with children, and I often left work in terrible pain knowing didn’t have any of my own.)

  
As each year passes, I think my opportunities for a family become more limited. I just don’t seem to feel the spark anymore. Men, women, nonbinary people...doesn’t matter.

  
My mom says that “fireworks feeling” is kids’ stuff and I should stop expecting it. I don’t want her to be right, but I’m starting to think she is.

  
Not wanting to be self-pitying, I make it a point to emphasize the other types of love in my life. I never leave a party without telling my best friends I love them. I also stay connected to my old teacher (also a single queer person) and my parents through Zoom. I never hesitate to tell anyone how much they mean to me…because I know life is so unpredictable.

  
And those incel doomsday vibes? Yeah, not into it. I hope that’s coming across clearly through this crumbly keyboard. I’m not trying to be self-indulgent. It just hurts.

  
I never thought I would end up here, so far away from my native home and culture, running a business by myself. I don’t know what to do. It feels like society never gave me a script.  
I still love reading romantic fanfics (yes, cringe all you want!) and smile when I see young people on a date. Even if I never got partnered, I want to make a world where that type of softness can exist in safety.

  
It’s kind of embarrassing to type it out, but these days, I see myself more of a steward of the community. I try to help others, especially young families and kids. If it didn’t happen for me, at least I can protect and provide resources for those around me. When my friends announce pregnancies, I genuinely want to cry because it feels like these people I love are being reborn in a tiny, beautiful new life. It gives me hope.

  
I’ve also looked into adoption and other means of building a family as a single person. I have a decent income, so I’ve been saving cash.

  
That said, I feel very, very alone...even stigmatized.I didn’t expect to end up here.

  
I don’t know what I want to come from this post…maybe some advice? Words of encouragement? Is it silly to expect the spark at my age? Any of your wisdom is much appreciated. There’s something so therapeutic about being anonymous and getting some guidance from others.

  
Thank you again."
"I'm going through an incredibly tough time right now. After a five-year relationship, my partner recently ended things. Our relationship was pretty bad; it was toxic the entire time because we're just so different. I grew up in an abusive environment, and it turned me into an abusive person. Despite that, there was genuine love and care, and we were like family. My partner was the first person to love and care about me, teaching me how to be a proper human being.

I've done things I regret; I've been physically, emotionally, and verbally abusive, a result of my mental illness and past trauma. Now, facing the breakup, I feel lost, embarrassed about my financial situation, the fact that I don't know how to drive, and the added struggle of not having a job or a career. I've practically become a hermit, rarely leaving my house except when forced by a friend.

Loneliness hits hard, and I'm struggling to function. I've always suffered from eating disorders, but since the breakup, I've been binge eating every single day. On the phone with my ex, I get a little delusional, pretending we're still together, lying to myself to find some comfort.

The pain is overwhelming; I genuinely don't think I'll ever love anybody as much, and the thought of dating anyone else is not something I want. I'm scared, and with no one to talk to, it feels like I'm drowning in this heartache. 

Adding to this, the lack of sleep has taken a toll, maybe three or four hours a night. It's contributing to this feeling of going more insane, making everything even more challenging to handle. If you can, try to prioritize self-care, even in the smallest ways, to help alleviate some of this burden."
"I'm in my mid twenties, working as a decently paid software engineer remotely from home.    
I still live with my mom and two sisters, so I'm never really alone but still quite lonely. I have friends but barely see them or talk to them too. I have dated quite a few times but never could get a connection with my dates and the one time I could they didn't feel the same way.  

I've talked about this with a few people already but I always feel like such a downer when my life is quite good/comfortable actually. My main issue I have right now is that I have troubles enjoying things. Games are okay, more like a way to pass the time. Going out is extremely tiring most of the time. All my ""hobbies"" are or turned into these passive things that I do to not stare at a wall all the time. Not enjoying them but it's better than doing nothing in a way maybe?  
I have no real goals or aspirations anymore either. I tried thinking about it a lot by myself but I feel like I'm not getting anywhere... So here I am (first time here)

"Hi! I really need to talk or hear others' opinions about some insecurities I have, maybe a kind voice could help...

There is so much things going on in my head that I'm not sure where to start. Many things are, I think, wrong with me/my life but currently my mind is filled with never feeling enough, mostly right now specifically is about how I look and even more specific is my vibe/how I am as a person. I know I've always had some problem with validation but I think it's getting worse. I keep needing it but it also comes with a feeling of guilt and disgust with myself for being such an attention seeker desperate for others' validation, so I end up falling deeper and deeper into self-loathing. I cannot think positively, anything I think and do is just wrong in my mind. I am wrong.

Thing is, I DO keep getting 'validation' because people actually do call me beautiful again and again, and yet why am I still like this? Surely it's because of me, something is wrong with my mind. Even after getting what I think I need, I still feel not enough. There must be something wrong with me but I honestly don't know how to overcome it.

This 'problem' does sound very vain and not important, but that's exactly why I am seeking it here.... Because I'm embarrassed to tell my psychiatrist or people I know irl... Honestly I am also embarrassed having to tell these vain thoughts on reddit but I've always had these thoughts for so long and I think it's getting worse so I really can't keep burying it, I need to reach out for help or at least have someone hear me out..."

"So many of these friendships fizzle out. Or it’s so clear that all they want is something sexual.

"A company I interned for a year ago got a job opening and my old supervisor asked my relative (who works there, hooray for nepotism) if I would be applying to it. I gave them my resume and they sent it in for me and I was feeling good about it until today. Someone from recruitment asked if I would be free today for a quick call I said yes! Thinking it would be just them going over the job and seeing if I was still interested but it was a full blown interview. I was so unprepared and caught off guard. I was asked questions about my resume and the job description and I didn’t even have either one in front of me. I just feel like a fool and I feel like I sounded stupid. She said she would get back to me early next week about a second interview but I’m scared I won’t get hired. I really need this job."
This guy came (a nice customer) and said here do you want this it would look nice on you then he came back later and said you can have this one too if you wana take the knot out! Aww he’s so sweet. Thank you sir! I forgot to ask him his name I will next time
I’m so tired. That is all.
"I’m using a throwaway just incase and I don’t know if this is nsfw so I just marked it as such. Anyways, I don’t really know what to do with my life. It’s kinda hard to know where to start but basically I feel like I don’t have any friends anymore or anyone who really cares about me. 
I just graduated high school this last spring and have been attending a state college for the last semester but I hated it there. I was only able to make “friends” with one person there but he was always busy due to him being a med student so I never was able to do much with him. Halfway through the semester I decided to transfer to a bigger school that just had a slightly worse program for the major I’m going into.
Now that the semester at the state school is done I feel like I have no direction in life. My only good friend that I’ve ever had has moved away and won’t be back for a few years but I feel as if he’s forgetting about me. None of my family have payed much mind to me making me feel unwanted. To add onto everything I suffer from a severe case of anxiety and depression which I am on medication for. 
I just don’t feel like life is worth living if I’m completely alone. The only thing that I have keeping me going is starting at that new university and that’s only because my parents already payed for me to go there.
I don’t know why I feel this way, I didn’t grow up poor, I was never abused, and I’ve been told that I have a lot of opportunities ahead of me. 
Does anyone have advice for me? And yes, I am trying to get into a therapist but most are booked for a few months.

Sorry if the grammar and stuff sucked. It’s late and I’m on a phone."
Just talk things out because most people are more than willing to work things out and squashing as long as honesty plays part from moment the situation gets brought up and both sides can always come up with a reasonable mutual whatever so that way nobody would have to get locked up or have to pin it on anybody
"Hey everyone, it's that time of the year again, and I just want to say congratulations. It's been a hard year, we've been through tough times, but we survived! You're all amazing! For those who are going through stuff, keep going and never look back what's past is past and you can build and grow, you learn more from going through it than you think, it might be painful and it's not fun but you're doing great, just keep your head held high and your eyes fixed on the light at the end of the tunnel and you'll come out whole. We mourn those who we have lost, but the lies they lived should not be forgotten cause everyone has had a good impact on they're lives from someone they've lost, it's sad and never good, but they'll stay with us in memory. This year was one of loss and gain and that's life. For those still going strong, be the inspiration to others that you didn't have, you never know who is in need of a good word or a kind voice. Of you're alone, I know it's terrible, but remember you're never alone, you know there are always people you can talk to, even if you don't know em. If you're with friends and family, enjoy your time with your loved ones, you newer know when you'll see them again.

With the year coming to a close, I know it's early for some and for others it's close to a new year, but I'm going to call it an early night.  Happy new year!!! Remember, this is your year, and you got this. Keep moving forward, you'll grow and become stronger than ever I just know it.
Stay safe everyone!"
"I have been tormented by the same problem for a long time and due to the fact that I have no one to share this with, I decided to talk about it here. I'm a medical student. Every time it comes to practice, my hands start shaking really bad. I can’t even properly pour liquid from one flask to another. It would seem like a small thing, but first of all, when teachers and classmates look at you like you’re an idiot or even laugh at you, it’s not very pleasant. But for many years I dreamed and thought that I would become a surgeon, but now because of this I believe in it less and less. I realized that my hands shake only when someone looks at me, because when I’m alone, everything is fine. I even went to the doctor. The neurologist said that I had a neurosis and prescribed some kind of sedative, which of course did not help. I have no idea what to do with this. I think maybe speaking out here will help a little."
"Hey, I had a pretty rough day and I’m feeling like crying a lot. Does anyone have a picture of their dog they could share to cheer me up and take my mind off things? 

Super appreciated and thanks in advance"
"Maybe the real answer is that, you can't force friendships. I can't force anyone to like me and the more desperate I am the more it comes out. There were two people I really wanted to be close to, but I ended up being closer to others without really expecting it. I have a really hard time in group dynamics and I've always struggled to make friends. So part of me really does wonder if I'm selfish. People are quick to defend you and say, you're a good friend. I'm not a bad friend, I'm sure, but I don't know if I'm okay with just accepting those flaws of mine either.

I have a history with mental illness and I think that it can really skew your world view. You swear that this is real, this is your world, that everyone does hate you, but they don't. But then there's this disconnect.

Why am I not happy if I am a good friend? Why am I not happy if everything on paper is good in my life. But maybe I'm reaching for the things that don't exist. You can't just logic your way out of emotion as much as you'd want to. Why do I get anxiety , why do I have triggers, why- and you start these self indulgent why that's not realistic.

Maybe these moments come and go. Maybe that's life. But still I want to learn to be a better friend, to be charismatic. To be loved by so many people. So that I never feel this way again."
Just looking for a kind person to talk to. 27m.
I’m chatting with this girl who I think the world of. We’ve been chatting and snapping back and forth. I think things are going well we haven’t met just yet I’m very very nervous to. I’ve been told I’m attractive and I have good physical traits but I’m starting to lose a battle againts MPB. It’s not as easy to cover up my thinning hair like I used to and I looked so much better with my full set of hair when it was spiked up. I’m really self cautious about this and nervous because I can’t do anything about the hair it isn’t atrocious just yet but it no longer looks full which is when I thought I looked my best. The fear of seeing her and her not texting me back again and such is consuming me so much.
Title. I need someone to help me calm me down.
"From loneliness, boredom, hopelessness, anxiety and regret. I feel like life has passed me by and I keep losing people I care about."
"You, I and everyone are on this same train we call life. At least I hope I can make you feel better on this journey."
"I just want to find a solution to my problems and my therapist also told me that this is too much for them to handle and I had enough with therapy and I’m getting frustrated because I haven’t found a solution yet! So fuck therapy and I done with them, it doesn’t help me at all! I tried volunteering at the animal shelter, I tried traveling, I went to the gym and I got burnout from it! I dislike going to the gym because it too loud even if I have headphones on! I’m just going through loneliness and having no one to spend time with have really effect my self esteem and I have no one calling me and I keep masking myself and no one is understanding me! I have autism and I keep struggling socially and my three therapist said some basic advice that so easy for normal people but it extreme hard for me and I put myself out there so many time and I keep failing and I don’t know how much longer can I keep failing a lot and I even tried dating app and I keep swiping everyday but I never get no matches!"
I shouldn’t be complaining disregard that title idk how to edit the title sorry
I need help and I need to talk to someone
"I’m looking for a kind and comforting voice to help me out through my anxiety.

"Hello everyone,
Since Saturday I have been suffering severe anxiety and obsessive thoughts about the future which result in panic attacks. I’m a college student going into my last semester of my undergrad and I have these thoughts of fearing that I might fail or I’m not smart enough. I’ve never had these thoughts before I don’t know where they came from but they have me very worried for the upcoming semester now and I can’t seem to shake them so that I can enjoy my winter break. I wake up every morning with a pit in my stomach and that’s the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about before I go to bed. I really need someone to talk to and to give me the courage and strength to let go my self doubting thoughts so that I can return back to my normal lifestyle. Thank you so much."
"

I’m 17 now but a couple years ago, when I was 15 I said something really terrible and now I feel like I deserve to die. Basically, me and my little sister (both autistic) were arguing and I called her the r slur after she punched me in the back of the head. I knew it was a slur at this point in my life but I thought it was okay for me to use it because I’m autistic too.

A half hour or so after the incident I decided to apologize because, even though I didn’t say it because she’s autistic, I thought I could’ve actually offended her and I wasn’t sure if she was comfortable being called that word as an autistic person. 

After that we had kind of just moved on and forgot about it until a week ago where I remembered what happened and started to feel extremely guilty. I might have OCD so my brain is always looking for reasons why I’m an awful person or why I deserve to die and I remembered this incident right after I had gotten over something else that made me feel like I need to die. Is what I did actually unforgivable? Do I actually deserve to die?"
"I inadvertently caught an acquaintance lieing to me tonight. She said one thing to me. Said another thing to a mutual friend who I happened to be couch surfing with tonight.

This is the latest instance of a woman lieing to me, amongst other types of slight/rudeness/manipulation/etc.

It feels like attempting to make lasting friendships and relationships is more trouble than it's worth.

I'm tired. So soul-crushingly tired. I've tried. I really have. And having to see acquaintances on Facebook happy and in seemingly healthy relationships doesn't help the feeling that I'm never meant to be happy.

I just turned 31. I'm actively working towards going back to school for a second bachelor's. I've succeeded in being published in several books/magazines as a contributed. I'm trying to better myself. And all that fate throws at me in return for my efforts is misery in my personal life.

I'm honestly thinking of divesting myself from social events and going to the gym instead. At least with that I'll be able to make measurable strides forward in terms of health."
"I don’t know what to do. I think I’m losing my mind. I have it good in a lot of ways. I have parents who love me, secure housing, etc., but I feel so miserable here. I fucking hate my college and think I’m losing my mind.

I attend an elite university with a low acceptance rate. For those factors, I thought most people would be ambitious and hardworking. That’s not the case; so many of them genuinely make me question how they got in. That sounds like a shit reason to transfer schools, but growing up with a prestige whore mindset, I honestly can’t take that there seem to be no people who are also burning up on the inside from the pressure. I need someone to relate to. That’s also part of the problem — I don’t have any friends. I go to school, go home, study. The only time I spend with other people my age outside of classes are when I’m attending or hosting club events. I treat everyone with a friendly, professional manner, but because I’m so intent on transferring, my top priority isn’t making friends. And that’s obviously detrimental to my mental health.

Another thing about the student body is the fake progressivism. I would rather be around people who genuinely care about politics regardless of their stances than people who act liberal but couldn’t give a damn. Also, what everyone says about students here is true — they’re lazy, out-of-touch rich kids. Nearly every lecture I go to, a good number of the students are shopping on Lululemon or some other rich person shit. 

I’m so fucking stressed. I can’t stay here, so I’m killing myself over the job search process, connecting with professors, and trying to make an “impact” through extracurriculars. My transfer options are limited to areas with family to save money on housing, and my parents won’t let me transfer to a “worse” school. That leaves me with three options, two of which are notoriously difficult to get into (think around 5% acceptance rates). I can’t concentrate anymore because I’m so stressed. I have 12 pages of research papers due in the next week and finals, plus other involvements. When winter break starts, I’ll need to send 50+ job applications and write transfer essays in the next few weeks.

I shouldn’t be complaining; in some ways, I’m just as privileged as the kids at my school. I’m a fucking hypocrite. Plus, there’s nothing necessarily wrong to with being rich. But I’m burning up inside, and I needed to get this out."
"I am a 41/F and a single mama of a teenager. 10 years ago I escaped a relationship with a man who became violent towards the end of our relationship. I lived afraid for my life for several years. Tomorrow is the anniversary of the most abusive incident I survived which he later went to jail, anger management, etc for. Unfortunately I still have to deal with this man because he is the father of our child. On top of that, I just lost my best friend and am feeling extremely depressed and lonely. I could use some kindness. ❤️"

"When I was 12-15, I did things that I didn’t realise were bad.

As I’ve matured, I’ve realised how wrong I was and I feel sick to my stomach. Everyone I’ve talked to has said I’m fine and that I’m killing myself over nothing. But it doesn’t make me feel better.

I’m so tired, so alone and I honestly only see suicide as a solution."
"So recently i have followed an influencer on Instagram....at the start i thought it was just normal. Like seeing his stories and liking his posts.Sometimes commenting even. But i realized it kind of grew on me. This attachment. i donot like this at all. It all happened (since he is a very interactinh person and interacts with his fans alot) when he posted my comment on his story and i was like I wait what? did he actually post my comment on his story? i was shocked .... then i made a fan edit of him (with a video and all) He put that on story too caption was"" Fan edit SIOL OMG I LOVVVE IT"" but then somehow it got deleted from my story and automatically from his story too Ahhhhh i really hate thissss .How to deal with this. i cannot take it if he sees and ignores my story.. if someday he did...what to do...

"I never knew what I wanted to do as a kid. I never wanted to do anything, never wanted a job. Never wanted to go to school. I did a job for a few years but it got too much and I quit and I havent got a job for a few years now.

I have no drive to get a job, even the idea of doing a job is dreadful to me. I cant even do the stuff in my own house when I have all the time of the day free. I cant do the dishes, cant clean my home. Its not now, its been like this all my life. When I did have a job, I used to cope by smoking weed when I was home all the time. Now I dont smoke weed or use other drugs, but I am still the same. I always have been. I never liked doing chores. 

I procrastinate to extreme degrees. Like I dont even pay my bills on time most of the time. I just think I will do tomorrow. Although now with increased self awareness I know that isnt true, so I no longer say it. I just think that it will get done. It does, but sometimes only after I get a letter in the mail that is telling me to pay it or I need to pay extra. 

I havent had friends for ten years. I barely leave my home at all. The issue is that I am on some level fine with all of this. There are two motivating factors as far as I a see for a human being. Fear and desire, or in other words desire for something to happen and the desire for something to not happen. The issue is that I can know I should desire something or fear something, and I may do, but the amount of desire I have is too little to actually get me to do stuff. Its like if your car has only a tiny amount of gass in it, you might get out of your driveway but after that the car dies.

Its the same for me. I know I should be afraid or concerned about my situation, but I dont feel that strong enough to do anything. I never could self motivate myself to fear. I always needed something very tangible coming at me that was unavoidable. Like a teacher tells me do x or y will happen. I think I have never done any things I see as chores because of desire to do them. For example the only reason I got a job in the first place was the fear of other people seeing me as a loser if I dont get a job. But now that fear is no longer strong enough to get me to get a job. The fear of doing the job, getting it, having to go to it every day is stronger.

People have suggested adhd or autism to me, and I think adhd might be the case here, but again, the motivation to get tests done is not high enough to actually get me to do the steps necessary to get a diagnosis. I looked into the process and its a long one with multiple visits, with the doctor interviewing you and your parents and all of that. Its just too much. 

I should clean my house. In fact me trying to clean my appartment is the reason why I am now writing this. Last time I did a somewhat bigger clean was half a year ago and only because there was a repairman who came to my appartment so knowing he was coming was the motivation to clean for me. Again, its always some external reason why I do things.

Some people have asked about depression also, but I dont feel depressed. In general I feel content, if I can stay in my comfort zone. But if I need to think about going outside, meeting people, interracting with people, it causes me to try to avoid that as much as possible. 

I really would like to do some running for example, but the fact I need to go outside to do it has kept me from doing it. I dont want to run and see people. I want to run and be alone. The same with taking walks. I like walks, but the serenity from the walks is offset by coming across people. So I have social anxiety. I am not sure that my social anxiety is stronger than other people, I just think my own ability to function with it is lower. Like I dont have the gas in the tank that helps me to counterbalance the social anxiety. Like when someone feels social anxiety, it means they dont want to do x acitivy that involves social anxiety. BUT they have another desire, desire to do that activity, and that countrary desire is strong enough to overcome that social anxiety. The reward is bigger than the strife to get it. For me, the reward is never big enough as a motivation. It could mentally be understood as big, but the issue is I dont FEEL it. I dont FEEL the drive, the motivation.

Thanks for listening to the ramble."
"Hi everyone. I went through a situation recently where I had reported a past assault. Unfortunately, it was determined by the police and by the legal system that it wasn't worth it to pursue charges against this person as too much time passed and financially it wouldn't really make sense for a law firm to take it on. I'm not really looking for any particular advice. I think I just feel like all that stress of going through the investigation and all the effort I put in, the trauma it brought back...what was the point. So now, seeing as there isn't really anything anyone else can do to help me, I have to put my life back together and move forward but I don't know how to do that. I don't want this to drag me down for the rest of my life. I want to be happy. I want to feel good and not spend my nights crying myself to sleep. I've tried some other reddit communities in the past where I did not really receive positive support so I am hoping here might be different."
"I am a late bloomer and my brain just bloomed so when I was 15-25 I just played and did nothing, I dabbled with languages and I didn't read books nor history! 😭 Right now my job requires lit, writing skills, psychology and philosophy so I have to go back to school,get my qualifications and go to university. I could have spent my teens on all the subjects but back then I wasn't smart enough 😕Before blooming I thought I would be uneducated forever and I tried to read about the A-H empire and I only understood surface level 😫At least I didn't commit crimes but...

"Someone please DM me, I've been dealing with strong feelings of suicide recently and I don't have any single person in my life to talk to. I've been so scared and alone."
"I got out of the psych ward a couple weeks ago feeling refreshed and optimistic, and I already feel like giving everything up again. I feel so fucking alone and I don’t know what to do. It feels like every aspect of my life is so fucked up and at this point I don’t know if the damage can be reversed. They never reached out to me about getting in person therapy, I have a place I’ve gone to in the past that I would like to return to but I have to pay the previous balance I had first. I also have to save up for a car, pay off an existing credit balance I have, it’s all so fucking stupid. I had to move away from all my friends, I don’t feel like I have anyone in my life anymore that actually knows me. I just wish I would die already I don’t know what to do. I’m sorry I don’t even know why I’m posting this. I just miss my old life and my friends and being somewhere where I could be myself and now I just feel so fucking alone."
"
I just want and crave loneliness. I hate people and I don’t want to be happy. I want to feel hate because throughout my life that is the only thing that I have felt. I can’t find love nor do I want the will to find it. I feel like a monster. My friends are friends with me through pity. My parents constantly lecture and berate me. I would love to be selfish because it’s better than to deal with people. The only thing that I want is just to truly be alone because I am used to it. I’m a failure, and I have accepted that I have no future. I hate being human. My plan moving forward is after I’m done with university in a year I plan to move out to a secluded area in the southwest and live out my days as a jaded old man being who I truly am completely and utterly worthless. Maybe I might get a dog idk. But that is my story the end. "
"I feel stuck. Like I have nothing to live for. I have no partner, I'm poor and work a dead end job. I suffer from major depression and I feel so lost. So alone. Wouldn't mind genuine people messaging me"
"I think I need counseling or therapy, not sure what is the difference. I am simply unable to speak in many conversations. My wife and I hardly speak beyond what is necessary. My family has been my biggest support but now I’m feeling interrupted and not heard. I don’t have a friend circle and I have had lunch by myself quite often at work. I am low on energy as well and sometimes have trouble sleeping. I wish u can spend time watching television and eating food. 

How should I plan to make sure my dependents are taken care of? If I sign up for therapy, what should I tell the therapist? It’s going to be expensive and I’m worried. 

Sorry if this sounded incoherent. I’m putting thoughts to words. "
"So, I have been with the most amazing soul I've ever met for the past 6 years. We met and it was an instant love at first sight, which for me is incredibly rare since I'm demi romantic/demisexual. It was an amazing 6 years together and we ended up getting engaged 2 years ago. However life has us moving down different paths now and as of Friday she has asked for a separation.

I am in turmoil, and my heart and mind are devastated. As it is I already struggle and fight anxiety and panic attacks, but this has pushed my overactive mind into overdrive and I'm having a hard time not worrying or crying.

I'm looking for some new friends to play PC games with and talk to on discord. Building a bit of a support network or distraction network I suppose.

Please be 18+ though. I am 35.

Thank you."
"Hi, I have some online friends but it is always nice to meet someone fresh from time to time. I am a 38 m from the UK. I like to have a laugh and enjoy silly, but not juvenile, humour.

I am interested by just about anyone and everything and love to learn new things. It would be nice to chat with someone that we can feel comfortable asking about anything while still respecting boundaries. 

Happy to talk to anyone 18+ regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity bla bla bla. Hit me up!

P.S Might be willing to voice chat at some point. Apparently I have a nice voice 🙂"
I'm at work and I'm not doing good. I'm about to breakdown. I need someone.
"I feel quite insufficient as a man for women because of several reasons, and I probably am for the most part. I would get into details as to why so but it would be too long when not explained while chatting

Also, I have been wrestling with OCD, Depression, Anxiety and Social Anxiety, all of which are seriously treatment resistant(can list my meds if you want a more concrete idea), for a long time now.

I'm going through a med change phase nowadays -which makes focusing and making my brain work really hard, and I need to be able to do those things as responsibilities are looming over- to address them, but I don't know it'll work as we have experimented with meds 2-3 times and they haven't helped enough

I also feel quite numb/out of it, emotionless and like a dead man walking(?) nowadays, I don't know how to describe it fully

Anyways, looking for someone to talk with, I would really appreciate it if you could lend an ear, thanks in advance🙏"

I’m hoping to connect with someone for a meaningful, long-term friendship—someone who values honest conversations, shared interests, and a real connection.

"I thought I learned how to control these negative thoughts. For about two years, it felt like I was gradually improving. I wasn't, I was just hiding and denying. I continue to deny it even though I know it is true. She has been in my head for almost a month now and hasn't shown any sign of leaving. I'm always thinking about her and nothing else, infiltrating all of my time and energy. I've learned that I can never get to know and value anyone because they can just 180 at any point. I don't just feel broken, I feel literally physically broken and useless."

Would anyone like to talk like how I explained in the title? I would really appreciate it if you could, I could seriously use a conversation with a friendly person to process what's going on in my life and mind right now.

I have taken an important step this week regarding women but my head is a jumble at the same time probably because of my recent med changes(psychiatric) and too many responsibilities. I constantly feel dizzy and... mentally out of it? I don't know how to explain but just trying to think about and remember what happened 1 or 2 days ago is so hard, it's like my brain is out of juice. Also, some things I have done during that step about women are bugging me as well.

"Hi, I wanted to vent but looked for a subreddit where maybe I can talk to people with similar experiences or just maybe get some support. Im just feeling kind of sad. I’m 19F and my parents are both 63. I have grown up being hyper aware of their age and constantly ruminating on it. All my friends have younger parents and I’m jealous. And right now it’s been hard. My dad is in good health but my mum has severe ocd and has been sick now for coming up on 2 years. We don’t get along but seeing her so sick is hard. I’ve been handling it pretty well for the past couple years but it’s starting to get to me. It just piles on with me worrying about their age. I just feel so sad sometimes. I don’t really know how to deal with these emotions. Idk I just needed to get this out cause I don’t want to put any of my friends in a  bad mood. It’s hard man. 

I’ve dealt with depression before, bad depression. I’m medicated now and I’m doing well. But the thing is, when I was depressed, I felt nothing. Now I just feel sad. I’m used to dealing with no emotion. But feeling sad is difficult for me. I just want my mum to be better and I wish my parents had me when they were a bit younger. I try not to stress about the future but it’s hard. I’m too emotional. Like whenever my teddy falls out my bed I start spiraling emotional lol. "

Hello again it's been awhile. I just need to talk really quick. I am in college and it is a struggle going back and working. I have managed to get my GPA up from a 0.0 to a 1.5 in 2 years but I don't think I am gonna make it to fix GPA before next fall so I will be on academic suspension. Is this a bad thing?

"A couple of days ago, I accidentally took an amount of edibles that was too much, which led to a mental breakdown (bad trip) for several hours and some realizations at the end—though it’s a long story I don’t want to get into. (I was on call with people on discord etc. I was scared, nestling against public washrooms private shower stall etc etc freaking out etc)  literal first time,,,,,,

Now after 2 days, the effects are gone, but I’m reflecting on my real life and often feel a lot of anger— why is love absent? I just want love. I want to be understood deeply and accepted, to have a safe space to go to, to have a reciprocal and equal connection. I’m even starting to doubt myself, which I think is pathetic and a perspective triggered by negative thoughts. I just want love. Pure love, without any entanglement of sexual attraction or other complicated things. I’m a sociable person (not entirely, it’s complicated but i am open to socializing)

The feelings aren’t caused by the edibles, though the experience heightened my sensitivity and awareness of my body, my needs, and my general state. I mention edibles because I want to emphasize just how unhappy I often feel.

I’m often so angry, and some of the things I contemplated during that trip are connected to this.

I don’t even want to go online anymore. I’m young (18), and I had a chaotic and negative and weird adolescence. For a while, most of my good connections with people were made online. Yet now, I lack friends and connection in my life. I don’t even want to go online because seeing people who have friends and social connections makes me upset and angry (though I try not to let it get to me)

FYI if it matters  I am alone in Thailand living in hostels and spent the past few days alone I dont want to share my entire life story it’s so exhausting and saddens me too much to be misunderstood or judged 

If you’re available (best if you have experiences with substances and speak Chinese) please DM me or I can reach out to you I want to chat

"(I’m F19 btw)

I questioned why I barely have friends. Meaningful friends, not temporary ones. My current friends is two, one who is basically having his life falling apart and doesn’t want help even though he needs it. The other is not on the radar at all. Maybe I’m ungrateful? Should I try harder? I don’t know… I just want genuine friends… Is it because I want something that is too unreachable? Is it because I do not give effort? But if I do give effort, will it be a waste of time? But am I overthinking it? Am I self sabotaging myself? Because I had trauma with other friendships where I made an effort but I was left alone in the end. I gave everything and received nothing. That was always the case since middle school. It continued on until now. I am envious with people I follow who go out and they are around my age. While the only time I go out running errands with my parents. I tried to be content that this is normal but there is always a feeling that this is not norma. That small voice always says that this is embarrassing and comparing myself to people who are my age that are better off than me. Am I unlikeable? Unapproachable? Maybe it’s because of my resting bitch face? Maybe it’s my weight? Should I get botox for my eyebrows? Should I lose weight? Will it finally get me to have friends? Will it make me happier? I always have my guard up because it’s a response to what has happened to me in the past. I hate feeling vulnerable… maybe it’s my anxiety that is stopping me? maybe it’s insecurity? maybe it’s fear…? maybe I’m overthinking everything… Is this why I will be alone forever… I don’t know if this is the seasonal depression talking… It’s always during Fall and Winter ever since middle school… Was all my trauma just from middle school… because that’s where everything just fell apart… I should just focus my studies and getting scholarships, internships, bachelors degree in chemistry, my doctorate in pharmacy, and my residency… fuck… maybe I do need a therapist… also the multiple tiktoks/reels about couples are pissing me off…"
"Hi, M25 here

Due to reason i don't want to explain in this post (but want to speak about in a chat) i have been feeling pretty miserable since June.

I've tried to sleep to feel a bit better but just woke up in the middle of the nigth and now am crying again, so i'd really appreciate being able to talk to someone.

Now I'm going back to the call centre but I'm scared they'll find out I was working while ""sick"" and fire me, I'm very insecure about money since I am an only child from a single mother and money was always tight, poverty scares me out so much. Idk I'm scared."
"I am conducting research on phenomena that has been occurring in my life. All of which are positive in nature, nothing of nafarius sort. Some of which have occurred for as long as I can remember. I need a hand confirming details, which will take an honest and open minded person and some time to discuss.

Thank you, for your time and consideration.

Just looking for someone to chat with. Having a rough time over an ex. 
"My parents, my mom who is pregnant is very controlling, she keeps telling me fix your time management rest, I do that now, but I have a lot of a lot of things to do, now she wants to take my laptop (my assignments are online) because she wants me to rest, I do. I don't understand what to do, I'm trying to communicate but she keeps getting angry, she would throw stuff at me, say hurtful words, and I just can't handle it, I'm trying my best. All I wanted to do was do my assignments, I'm a academically hard-working person, she knows that. I bring home Straight A's all the time, she appreciates that, but she just wants me to learn, and learn, she thinks I'm playing games on my laptop but I'm just doing my assignments (I don't have time for games),now she wants to take my laptop, she called me to to her room and told me to sleep in my bedroom and stop using my laptop, I did but she went into my room and said when it hits 5 pm give me your laptop (It was 3pm I had multiple assignments left it was on a Sunday, my teachers give us a lot of homework), I tried to ask why she just throwed some stuff on me while I was lying down, she almost threw a lotion bottle at me(mind you the lotion pumper was sharp), I experienced multiple scenarios where she just wanted to hurt me, I just wanted to communicate. To be honest, I just think she is jealous, I know that sounds bad but I always work hard on my studies and use sufficient evidence with each argument we have I'm not bragging I'm smart but she seems angry when I do that, I'm just trying to explain why are you angry, I don't know now. One time I almost c\*t my wrist, thankfully something snapped me out of it. **Reddit can you give me advice?**"
"Trigger warnings for sh, bulimia, suicidal thoughts 
Im 16 year old male, I would prefer someone around my age but older works too.
If you dont know what to say it's okay, I just need to vent"
Like the title says just need a second opinion. 
"Hello everyone. I'm Nao. Just like the title say, I'm open to DM if you need someone to talk to. But no NSFW please and no venting your emotion either. If things get uncomfortable I will tell you right away. 

I'm sorry I can't provide call service because my spoken English is not that good. I'm good at writing though that's why perhaps a voice note would be good if you prefer to talk. 

You can also reach me through KindVoice discord. 

Hope this help. 

Have a good day. "
"Howdy, 

Title says it all.

If you’re feeling down and need to get shit out, then use my inbox as your personal chamber, No judgement will be passed there.

I can offer advise where asked but I won’t be able to offer this is I don’t believe I can provide any productive discussion that would lead to a positive outcome."
"I (24/F) have always known that I'm not the sharpest tool in the box. Though I've been an average student, I seem to fair poorly when it comes to actual matters of life. I am unable to take simple decisions, communicate properly or even think about the future and what I should be doing in life. I find it hard to understand others' emotions and tend to be a bit awkward in general. This behaviour of mine is ruining one of the most relationships in my life, and I would give just about anything to change myself. The truth is, I don't know where to start and need help."
"PLEASE HELP!! I really don't know who else to turn to, as my family/friends are very touchy about this kind of thing. You guys are the only people that I can ask because this is my first time posting something this serious, and nobody in our family has a good relationship with each other. I really love my sister but she won't open up to me as she used to, ignores me the whole day, and doesn't talk to anyone unless it's to tell someone to do something to make her life easier. Basically my sister was caught cheating and could fail the class(its a higher level class w/ strict teacher). Her high school is very competitive and good, almost a magnet school where most teachers are strict, and I don't know whether the teacher said he'd fail her as a threat(because of her bad behavior/performance in the class previously) or if that's what he usually does(I don't think other teachers would go this far but I don't know). People are now saying she could get rejected from major colleges that she applies to(she's a junior). She still doesn't see herself in the wrong, even in now. She usually turns in all of her work late and fails quizzes, preferring to spend study time on entertainment, yet still wants to go to a good college.  
She also has a history of disobedience with most people around her and I fear this could carry over to her attitude at school(I fear she may be cheating on other tests, but either hasn't been caught yet or just won't tell me), but I don't know as I am too old to go school with her.  
People before have told us to leave her alone and let her find her own way, but she has gone deeper and deeper down her original way. She is playing with fire and doesn't know it and rejects all other's assistance to save her.  
I am pleading with y'all as I am nearly at my wits end about what to do with her. She's slightly scared now, but is it too late? Does she still have a chance? Is this teacher too harsh? What should we do now, in terms of what to do with her and this situation?  
 I'm not really good with words and this is a really hasty post, but I hope I got my meaning across. Reading over it I know it seems very vague, but I also don't really want her to know who I am as she has reddit too.  
Will notify yall with any updates.  
Thank you all!"

"Hello, I have a genuine question regarding college. Answering this question will help me get through this semester. 

For some context: I am going to community college in the U.S. specifically Texas. 

TELL ME WHY there are so much unnecessary bs imbeded in the courses. I'm doing an Associates degree in Accounting. Meaning loans, simple and compound interest, flow of money through different types of economies, crunching money numbers for personal or business reason, right? WRONG! 

I'm doing Matricies, inverse Matricies, finding the inverse Matrix from the original Matrix complicatedly multiplied by the Identiy Matrix. WTF? This is not what I wanted to do. This not Accounting. 

Someone please tell me why this Accounting course is unnecessarily complicated. 

Note: If this is what Accounting really is, then I'm switching my major to Economics. "

"I just lately feel so overwhlemed frustrated and irritated internally in a way like I just don’t feel myself. I went to few shopping stores today and couldn’t even pick out something because I just felt this weird feeling that wow look at, what the heck I’m doing in life. Im out of shape, my social skills sucks, I’m not driving and I don’t even have a job and education qualifications. And my family says why don’t you pick something. Thought I do like many things back of my mind it just makes me realize that why would I give burden to my family so it makes me feel guilty to buy things. "
"I had a friend, we'll call them Kyle, who was thinking of suicide on their birthday. I really liked Kyle, not romantically, but I've known them since we were elementary, so I felt a kinship with them even if they weren't my life to lose and I really meant nothing to them (probably). On the day before their birthday, I spoke up to someone who I know coulda got to them about their suicide whispering. That made Kyle upset and I heard them on the bus talking about how stupid it was to get called out like that and how their friend (who they were talking to at the time) was one of three who they told. I was one of the mentioned three. I kept my head down and earbuds in, something I did often, but kept one out to listen to them. Kyle was upset, need I say more. On their birthday, I played stupid, just saying ""happy birthday"" and all that jazz, but inside, I was a nervous wreck. The next day, Kyle was alive and (mostly) well, if not tired/upset. That night, I confessed over text. Brave, I know. I told them I talked, how I didn't expect forgiveness, sorry, and blocked them on all socials. I left that school that day, so it pretty much worked out for me. Most recent, my best friend of the same caliber (elementary wise) was still availible. But did Daddy Depression like that very much? Noooope, and Daddy Deppression always gets what he wants, so he bent me over his knee and whipped me until I eventually told bestie (we'll call them Craig) that I wasn't going to comitt suicide, but to never contact me, they've been a good friend to me but I feel like I'm just weighting them down, and how I hope they do better without me, and blocked them on everything they could contact me on aswell. My dad broke his wrist after a car he was fixing exploaded, the family friend and dog died, and I'm starting to show signs of depression again after five months. I just want to get this out of my brain sponge, but the only way to do that is the number one thing that all my therapists used to say was the number one thing I couldn't do, so I'm just gettin' 'er done one day atta time. Oh yeah, and therapists don't work for me, just the slap on the rear from Daddy Depression to make sure I don't try to, y'know, get better or anything silly like that."
