"showering is my own personal hell. 

due to a combination of severe depression and childhood sexual trauma, showering is incredibly difficult for me. sometimes i manage, sometimes i don‚Äôt. and this time, i was not managing AT ALL. 

ive been trying to take a shower now for a while, but every single time something trivial would happen and I‚Äôd lose my mind. 

i finally got it done today though! my hair is still incredibly matted, but at least i smell good :) i will probably struggle the next time i have to take a shower, but at least i got a shower done this time "
It doesn't sound like much but it is to me. I still feel awful but I need to take this win so I'm posting it here. That's it. That's the post.
"I am tired of the social pressure just to be a woman. Have a perfect hair, make up, clothes, smile 24/7 :), be a good girl, work hard, menstruating since 11 with pain every 3 weeks, wearing a bra with intense back pain, taking care of people because people expect that from us‚Ä¶ Always a performance just to be beautiful, I usually spent 1 hour and a half every morning just to get ready, my partner is ready in minutes‚Ä¶ 

I have spent my life with depression and anxiety due to all requirements I have to achieve being a f*cking good girl.. and I am not going to talk about abuses at work, mens staring and saying dirty things in the subway or on the street, always afraid in case something happens to you‚Ä¶ Or women being b*tches with other women, argh so tiring

I feel like a slave.

I am exhausted.

EDIT: I am thinking about erasing this post. I am tired of people (mostly men) invalidating my feelings and experiences. Ok it‚Äôs my choice and I don‚Äôt have to. I invite you to ask to women around you how they truly feel, maybe you‚Äôll have a suprise. 

You just read about the ‚Äúsuperficial‚Äù part of the post, the part about make up and that stuff, it‚Äôs curious anybody talked about abuses at work and feeling always about something happening to us just coming back home. I'm tired of feeling unsafe on the street for the mere fact of being a woman, it‚Äôs just an example of something biggest on the background in this patriarchal world.

"At least getting it started. I moved to my apartment in December because of the move stoped taking my anti depressants, and I honestly haven't cleaned it since, it's horrible and I hate it so much. I just can never really stick to cleaning it. I start and then just stop. I've tried doing a cleaning for 15 minutes for every hour and that never works either. Any tips would be amazing 

Edit: thank you all so much for the advice, I was a bit overwhelmed with all the advice I was given, wasn't expecting to get so much! Thank you! I've been on my anti depressants for almost a week now and I've slowly started cleaning my apartment. Again thank you so much for all the advice!"

"I started having suicidal thoughts when I was 15 and I was almost certain I would kill myself.

"My name is Yamen Nashwan, and my family and I are currently living in a small tent in Rafah after being displaced for the fifth time. Our lives have become a daily battle for survival. 

Finding food has become nearly impossible. We‚Äôve lost our home, our jobs, and every bit of savings was spent on our latest displacement and setting up this fragile tent. We often go to bed hungry, not knowing if we‚Äôll have anything to eat the next day.
 
Getting clean water is a constant struggle. I spend hours standing in long lines, just to fill a few containers with water that‚Äôs barely safe to drink. The fear of airstrikes is always with us, making this simple task even more dangerous. 

My father, who was severely injured during our escape, and my mother, who is also ill, need medications we simply can‚Äôt afford. Prices are sky-high, and medicines are scarce.
Despite spending everything we had, it‚Äôs still not enough to care for them.

All of this happens while bombings and gunfire continue around us. Each night, we lie awake, terrified that the next explosion will be our last. The fear of death is a constant reality here."
"I (m23) did a psychedelic trip (3g) to help get over small amounts of occasional depression after hearing all the positive effects from podcasts and stories and followed the John Hopkins protocol. It's basically a therapeutic way to take psychedelics and dive deep to get better. The trip ended up making things worse. It's been about a month now and I've been having all kinds of bad symptoms. More fatigue, low motivation, random intense thoughts that pop out of nowhere about how nothing matters, over analyses of everything (like why do I have hands and what's the purpose), and tons of anxiety to the point of borderline panic attacks. It's been scary and I was living a really good life before I did the trip.

I work out 6 days a week, I take supplements like fish oil, daily multivitamin, and magensium for sleep. I work 2 jobs that are pretty good and make good money. I have lots of friends and family. I meditate daily but everything feels hard. Like my brain just wants to sleep all day and if I don't I'm just anxious and get intense depressed episodes randomly. I've been trying to keep up my good habits but it has been super hard and stressful. I'm looking for a therapist, but in the meantime I want any guidance and advice to help me. 

How do you manage these scary random thoughts? What do you do when you feel severely depressed / nothing matters feelings. Should I look into medication? It's all overwhelming and I've never dealt with such extreme amounts of certain symptoms. I haven't really improved much, but not all days are bad. Some days I feel pretty okay. Any advice to help get better would be appreciated, thank you

EDIT: About 1 Year After The Trip
I want to say I'm doing much better than where I was one year ago. It was horrible, and if I didn't get better, I probably would've taken my life. I believe the experience was traumatic in the sense that I wasn't ready to let go and felt forced to experience difficult things. During the initial parts of the trip I felt like I was dying and saw hyper realistic visuals of decay, rot, and death. After an hour it stopped, but I was definitely not the same. Disassociation, severe anxiety, pychosis like symptoms, major depression, OCD all followed me for months. It took me about 6 months until I finally started feeling slightly normal.

My advice to anyone going through this: You're 100% not alone. I've had tons of people message me about this. Psychedelics are like playing with fire. Play with too much and you'll get burnt. Start low, and go slow. People who've tripped many times before have also gone through what I've gone through. It can happen to anyone. Therapy helped me stay sane, and so did supplements. Sometimes your brain needs time to heal, it's like breaking a bone. You won't be able to run on a broken foot after a week. You aren't crazy, and this isn't permanent. You won't feel this way forever. I thought I would and a year later I feel alive again. I struggle some days, but I'm intune with myself. With time we will all be okay. Take your sleep serious, commit to being better. Where there isn't motivation, there's discipline. It gets easier. Exercise helps, mindset helps, diet helps and so does many other things. You can and will heal, but you have to commit to it. I believe in you. You don't have to be strong, you just have to survive and the rest will come. Thanks for reading :)

"Hearing this feels like a slap in the face. Who are you to tell me I don't want to die? Some people really do want to die. It's not just about the pain ending, I just want to get it over with honestly. Life isn't for me, and life isn't for everyone. We didn't ask to be here, so it should be acceptable that some people really just want to be dead but it fucking isn't and I hate all of this suicide awareness bullshit because they're so focused on keeping you here as a slave. ""It gets better,"" ""life is beautiful/ a gift,"" ""you're cared about"" ""people will miss you"" none of this actually helps and people know it doesn't but they say it anyway"
"I feel like I've tried everything. Antidepressants, therapy, TMS, Ketamine, mushrooms... I've had depression my entire life, it got exponentially worse when I was 14 when a parent died. I think I damaged myself by not sleeping enough as an academically inclined child/teen. I'm possibly damaged from ssris or antipsychotics because the first doctor who prescribed me meds was a pediatrician, not a psychiatrist, and had no idea whet she was doing. I don't even remember most of my teenage years because of the medication and trauma. I've been on and off meds for the past 15 years, some worked for a while but eventually stopped working. I tried everything. I've been trying newer treatments like TMS and Ketamine and they had absolutely no effect on me. I feel like I've wasted my entire life trying to fight depression with minimal success and I don't know what to do next. Has anyone tried anything else? Has anyone had success? (And yes I've tried diet and exercise etc etc. And please don't suggest religion)

"I matched with someone online, and things were going well for a while. We talked a few weeks and she seemed great. Well... things heated up between us and it eventually got sexual. 

Well, as the title suggested, the moment she saw my penis she did nothing but make fun of it. Said I'd never, ever have a fulfilling relationship, and that it was disgusting to look at, and that I should be ashamed of myself for even showing it to her, and to only ever try to find a woman when I  got cut, because theyll ""do exactly what she did if they knew what was best for them"". Mind you, it was clean, didn't smell, or any of the other stuff that people make fun of it for. I do admittedly have a slightly longer foreskin so it doesnt pull back as far, but other than that  everything  was good. Everything was happy, fun, and positive right up till that moment where she flipped that switch. Honestly, I'm absolutely terrified to be intimate with anyone ever again. I'm a very affectionate person, and honestly now I'm afraid of it. It totally messed my day up. This has happened multiple times, but I don't want to get surgery to cut part of myself of...

"My name is Yamen Nashwan. I try to survive in what once was Gaza. I still remember the morning of October 7th.
We got awake early by the sounds of bombings and explosions which rattled my heart out of my chest.
Some times I lie awake at night and think about just the day before that.
I feel like that was a dream.

I am a different person now, I look different. My weight is reduced to half of what I was.
I was an athlete who played Basket ball and volleyball..and now I can't even get up to eat..our bodies are so weak, with nothing but one meal a day. 

I lost a lot of my best friends during this war..
I met them every day..I felt dead inside..after every news of my friend becoming a martyr..I did not feel I was alive..the memories of our time spent together..rushed through my brain and eyes.


When my father lost the ability to walk due to the occupations bombing..my world shattered even more. He already had high blood pressure diabetes. There were no resources for us to look after him and treat him. No nutritious food.
The painkillers were very mild, and the strong ones. Very expensive.
One day I heard him moan and cry at night in pain.
My life changed from that day.

"UPDATE BOYS IM NOT A FATHER


i don't know what to do. i've never gone on the internet and asked for help and im sure no one's going to see this but please someone help. im 15 and i was messing with this girl not even dating and i just got told from her that she hasent had her period in 2 months and she's going tomorrow to take a test at the doctors im so fucking scared and i'm not in the correct place to deal with this i have been in and out of a psychiatric hospital for the past couple months and i have the most strict parents. my dad who i just recently started talking to again actually had kids at the same age as me on accident aswell but i still think he would kick me out and or go crazy i didn't tell or ask her to get an abortion she just openly
 said she's planning on to if she has to i really don't know what to do guys i don't want my parents to be involved in this and i have 0 people to go to."
"

My fianc√©e recently let me know that she put herself up for a waiting list for euthanasia, as she feels like her depression will never get better, and that she feels like she's hurting people around her with her behavior/presence.

TLDR: She had a neglectful and violent childhood, with depression among many other mental disorders as a result. Has been in therapy since age 12, with often the wrong diagnoses and unhelpful therapy, and just an overall shitty mental health system that made things even worse. She is tired of living this way and wants to die on her own terms. I need to help her ASAP.

I believe it all originated from her childhood, as she has been neglected by her parents. They are both not the type of people that should have gotten children, as they are selfish, dismissive, and show no care. Consequently, she had to do everything herself during her childhood. Her parents had a violent divorce during her puberty, which added on to the already present depression and insomnia that started at age 12. Her parents were never loving, and instead made her feel like she was the cause of any trouble or inconvenience there was. She had done a couple of suicide attempts, which her parents called ""attention seeking"".

She's a highly intelligent, funny, and frankly gorgeous girl, that often tends to bounce off the walls from her ADHD. On the surface she seems like the happiest person, but on the inside her screamingly intrusive thoughts make her starve herself, abuse substances, and hurt herself. This caused her to lose many friends, and she has seen what the effects of those episodes were on me as well.

She has been in therapy for over 10 years now, and because the mental health system is so fucked up and bureaucratic in my country, with treatment waiting times often STARTING from 6 months, she is done with it. She is done with all the bullshit CBT that never worked for her any way. She has had too many setbacks, and is now on Effexor and a dozen other meds which barely help. But she can't change the meds either, because of the horrible withdrawal effects. The only good psychiatrist that she ever got was one she saw a couple of months ago, and lives across the globe (she went to study abroad for a period of time).

My question is: what can I do? Any similar experiences? It's extremely difficult to just keep on studying and living my own daily routine, while I know that time is running out. I know that eventually she is the one to make the decision about her own life. I can't control that.

But I love her so so very much. She has shaped me into the (much) better man I am today. I get very unhappy without her. She does absolutely not deserve to go out like this, she deserves a happy, loving, and fulfilling life.

What I'm already trying, is to get as much distraction and do as many fun activities as possible with her. I also want to do social activities, so she has the possibility of getting to know new people and make new friends again. For now this is working alright, but I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff here.

Thank you for reading, I'm sorry if my writing formatting is off. Gets hard to write while tearing up, haha."
"Go hang out with a friend you haven't seen in a while and catch up, or if you go for a 20 minute walk and smile and say hi or hows it goin to a stranger passing by. It's simple and it will help exponentially with riding yourself of depression. So if you comment that you will go and do that, for every person participating I'll walk one mile per person. Not only to show people actually care... Especially people who have been there but also to practice what I preach.... Another tip I have is 30 min cold shower.... It will raise your dopamine through the roof and get you up and going"
"Im 26‚Ä¶ and I feel like I'll never achieve anything. I feel like I'm behind everyone else, and I feel I have no desire or motivation to be anything. A lot of times I wish I wasn't around anymore. I feel like this world isnt for me."
"We‚Äôve been living in this tattered tent for over 15 days now, and with each passing day, we feel more and more stripped of our basic rights. We have been forced to rely on cheap canned food that barely passes as edible. All because of the surge in prices that they sell normal aid food for which people of Gaza cannot afford most days.

Our meals consist of fava beans, lentils, and luncheon meat that even cats wouldn‚Äôt touch, but it‚Äôs all we can afford.

Every day, my nieces and nephews accompany me to the market, their tiny fingers pointing longingly at the fresh vegetables and fruits displayed on the stalls. Their eyes light up with hope as they ask, ‚ÄúWhen will we eat apples? When can we taste tomatoes and oranges?‚Äù And I stand there, my heart breaking, knowing I have no answer for them. It tears me apart to see them dreaming of something as simple as fresh produce.

My father, who is injured, and my sick mother are in dire need of nutritious food to help them recover. The doctors have said they need a healthy diet, but I can‚Äôt even provide them with the basics most of the times.

I see the pain in their eyes, and I know they‚Äôre trying to be strong for me, but their condition worsens with each passing day.

Life inside this overcrowded tent is unbearable. The cold bites at our bones, and the rain that poured some days ago night flooded everything we own. Our clothes, our bedding, everything was soaked and covered in mud. We had no dry spot to rest, no place to escape this misery. "
"My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 24 years ago. And it‚Äôs getting worse and worse. Last november he was capable of doing simple things like brushing his teeth alone or using a remote control. But now he can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs paralysed from the neck down. He now wants to get an assisted suicide in switzerland. And since my dad is my favourite person, I‚Äôm completely devastated. I‚Äôve been crying myself to sleep for the past two weeks. So, if someone has some advice on how to handle this whole situation better, please tell me."
"Nothing bad specially happened to me, but I‚Äôve found myself glued to my bed all week. Haven‚Äôt left my apartment. Haven‚Äôt seen any friends or family. I can barely respond to any messages. Can‚Äôt get more than a couple tasks done each day, and it takes ALL my willpower. I spend the entire day scrolling and watching content. I don‚Äôt feel sad, but I‚Äôm not happy. I don‚Äôt feel a strong support system around me, which is hard. Everyday I want to do better but can‚Äôt. I need some advice for getting back on my feet"
Anybody else sick of hearing that phrase? Some of us have been fighting severe depression all our lives and it doesn't get better for some people...
"I need some advice.

So he didn‚Äôt mean it that way but I just think that was a careless thing to say since I‚Äôm struggling with suicidal ideation. In one way, we have options and killing ourselves is always an option, in another perspective killing ourselves should never be an option. The fact that it was layed out on the table for me to begin with was probably not okay‚Ä¶

I was complaining on how I was suicidal and am stuck in a bad living situation and have no car and he was like you wanna kill your self because you have no car? That‚Äôs always an option or you can keep trying to get out of there (the bad living situation). 

I commented that it sounded calloused and showed lack of compassion. He shrugged and said ‚ÄúAlright. You can write me off as an uncompassionate guy.‚Äù But then encouraged me to keep finding a way out and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give up.‚Äù

(I‚Äôm also Christian and he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised that someone with your faith is having these thoughts‚Äù‚Ä¶that didn‚Äôt help. He said that followed by ‚Äúhave faith‚Äù. It felt so up and down.)

My living situation is not the only reason why I‚Äôm having these thoughts but I guess understand what he was trying to get at here. 

Even though he didn‚Äôt mean it that way is this considered a red flag? I just need some discernment. "
"Or is it just me?

What does it feel like for you?"
"TW: Suicide, suicidal ideation. 

Last night a person said that people who post about being suicidal are attention seeking. I replied to him that it's not true and said (stupid, I know) that I have tried to off myself several times. He told me that I'm just seeking attention and that I should try a different method. I got banned from that sub for 2 days so I sent him a chat telling him that I am not seeking attention and how awful of a person he is. 

Apparently nobody cares about me, I'm an idiot, a failure and my breath stinks. His words. And I should go on and kill myself. You know what's the funniest thing? He hasn't been banned from that sub and his comments were still up before I deleted the post. 

So yeah, fucking good morning to me! I started this morning by ugly crying and thinking of suicide and self harming. "
"Hey guys so there was a guy in dated 7years ago. This guy literally took off the condom and made me pregnant. Luckily i was able to find out sooner and got an abortion.
I didn‚Äôt even know he had a wife and kids.
So i told him before i had an abortion te situation that why am i pregnant etc.. he said he took off the condom and he will take care of me etc etc.. so i decided to do abortion and told him about it.. i mostly did it because i felt violated and that he wanted to make a life decision for me without my concent meanwhile i was a scholarship student and was 17yeaes younger than him. So basically my was a scholarship student.. also he was married which he lied to me. Another thing that made me make that conclusion is because at one point. He literally told me. I won‚Äôt allow another man have you. If i die we die together.
So after the abortion we parted ways because i didn‚Äôt want anything to do with him.. he doesn‚Äôt consider me as his equal and other mental control he was doing to me.
So years passed by and he met me.. but he told me he hated me and he will never forgive me for what i did. Meanwhile i feel he abused me and violated me.. trying to baby trap me..
I still don‚Äôt understand this.. is he a terrible person or just delusional or what is happening here. To be honest i hate him as well. But am not good at expressing my level of hate as he does.. any suggestions!!"
Videogames and lifting don't cut it for me anymore. What cheap hobbies can I do? I'm doing this hopefully to cope
"I feel like the world overall is terrible. There is so much injustice, hostility, unfairness, and suffering that happens. I really think the bad in the world outweighs the good. Yes, there is good in the world but to me, it seems like there is more bad overall. Most of the world's people live in poor conditions and only like 1% of people have a large chunk of the wealth, resources, and power.

Too many people are superficial, cruel, and selfish. There is so much oppression in the world. There is too much greed, hostility, and aggression. I feel like the world is dangerous and terrible overall."
Can someone hug me? I can't stop hitting myself and think about self-harm. Can someone just hug me and pretend I have any worth?

"I don‚Äôt know how help my Husband.  
He is spiraling into one of the worst depressions, and I cannot save him.

Over the past maybe year, he has slowly been getting darker.  
He is so angry, everything sets him off. The weather, the laundry, the dog, the house, the time of day.

Things have escalated in the past 6 months. He left his job of 8 years, as he was miserably unhappy. I really hoped this would help get him in the right head space. Well, he is into his new job now and it is not a great workplace but pays well. He is miserable still.

He has completely given up. When he is On Call and his phone is dying or not near him and I tell him to charge it, or find it, he goes ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù ‚Äúfuck them‚Äù

He works from home and doesn‚Äôt really work anymore, just plays games saying he deserves the break and that it is fine. I do work, but if he loses his job I cannot afford the bills alone.

He won‚Äôt go to bed, he won‚Äôt sleep, he has stopped caring for his personal hygiene, he rages over every little thing.  
Honestly, I believe the lack of sleep is starting to affect his mind, he keeps remembering conversations wrong, dipping out mid conversation, and when I ask WTF he says he didn‚Äôt do that and has no memory of it.  
  
I love this man more than anything and have supported him the best way I know how. I am trying to take him out, do fun activities, do all the chores, the only thing I can‚Äôt do is carry the laundry up and down the stairs, and when asked he rages. I walk on eggshells around him.

When confronted about any of this he says ""he must just go to the bottom"", or ""he has to fail"", ""he is going to just sink into it"". ""He is going to let it happen and give up on it all"".

He doesn‚Äôt want out, but I can‚Äôt live with this anymore. We have had many conversations; he tries really hard for a day or two and then something upsets him, and it is back to anger and treating me like shit.  
He has really bad SADs and winter is coming, he always struggles in winter but he is going into it this time in such a dark place. I am honestly scared for him.

He doesn‚Äôt believe in medication, or therapy, or really anything that can help.  
I have struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life and this man has seen me through some of the ugliest times and was always my rock. I feel weak and like I am failing him, my mental health is starting to take a toll, and I just don‚Äôt know where to go from here or how much longer I can last.

Any advice would be so helpful."
"I‚Äôm 29 and barely holding on. I legit wish I didn‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôve got no interest in anything right now, I think they call this ‚Äòanhedonia‚Äô or something."

On Friday (December 15th) I learned that my best friend, Lenny, has cancer, specifically lymphoma. I‚Äôve been trying to mentally prepare myself for the worst‚Ä¶but I don‚Äôt want to lose my best friend. My family got Lenny just before I turned 12, I am now 20, and Lenny is supposed to turn 10 in March. I know this is the average life expectancy for his breed‚Ä¶but it pains me so much to lose him. 

 My family and I do have 2 other young dogs which will help me feel better, but Lenny is special‚Ä¶he was there for me when no one else was, for a period of time he was my only motivation and the reason I got out of bed. Whenever I would get upset about something he always runs over, tries to sit in my lap and make me feel better. 

My family is somewhat well off, he is being treated by SASH animal hospitals (equivalent to a human hospital) in their specialist cancer ward. Lenny has had some biopsies done and we are currently waiting to hear back about our next steps. But we have been told the cancer is advanced, but not stage 5. 
 
Every time I think about what I personally want my final plans to be with him I can‚Äôt help becoming hysterical and breakdown crying. I can‚Äôt lose my buddy, I love him too much. 

Attached is a photo of my buddy"
"I don't know if there is anything I can do for him. He thinks he has no other choice other than killing himself. He had a plan on Saturday that he was going to kill himself when I left for work. I felt something was off so I called in and he didn‚Äôt do it. I don't know what to do. He's not actively trying to kill himself but he's talking as if he has no other choice. He doesn't think anything is going to help. He says he's been depressed for over 10 years, since he was 14. I am afraid I won't be able to help him and I don't know what to do. He feels utterly defeated and bleak. I'm afraid to put him in a hospital because of past experiences (and he says it'll make it worse). I don't even know if reaching out to his friends is going to help since he felt embarrassed by his last depressive episode. 

He has done everything that I can think of to help and things that even ""science"" has prove. He has tried all of the little gratitude moments, he has done exercising, he has meditated religiously for years, he doesn't eat terribly, he drinks water, he has gone and is going to therapy, he's tried having a job and not having a job. He works at his ""favorite place in the world"" and is still depressed. 

I don't know what to do. I am very scared that he is going to go through with it and I don't know how to help or do in this matter. He has been so depressed for years, he hates waking up in the mornings and just automatically hates everyday. I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶.."
"My (44f) husband (45m) passed away on March 25th, I am still in disbelief. He truly was my very best friend. We‚Äôve known each other since we were 16-17. He was my second husband, and we were married for 6 years, together for 11. 

Now, my ex husband (34m) is seeing me in a vulnerable position, and has decided that he would deny me access to my daughter (12f). He was has had her since March 27th. We have an agreed upon schedule that we have always followed, and maybe tweaked here and there to accommodate plans or whatever. Our court order is 50/50, and there is no set schedule.  It is simply supposed to be as agreed. Because of what has recently happened concerning my husband and him see his opportunity, my ex husband has decided with no agreement from me, to follow the recommendation of the county and follow their spring break schedule for parent visitation. It states that he gets her from 6pm Friday the 29th of March until April 7th at 6pm. During this time he has slowly been driving her and I apart with less and less communication each day. Last night I was checking up on one of her social media accounts and making sure she was ‚Äúbeing good‚Äù because last week she was caught being talked to sexually by a boy and she was ok with it and didn‚Äôt end the convo. Anyways, as I was reading a couple messages kinda skimming around, I read one that says her dad told her that I accidentally murdered her step dad. I DID NOT! She also was telling this friend that she was told that I need to ‚Äúlive in a rehab house with 5 other people and that they would give me food and water and therapy‚Äù. I do not do drugs, drink, or anything that would cause me to be out of sobriety. As far as therapy, hell yeah I could use that, so could she. Nothing wrong with that. So, throughout this last week I have called, the police, CPS, FoC, even the governor‚Äôs office, along with any other agencies I thought could help. I‚Äôve gotten no where. FoCsays to file a complaint, which I did. He now has 3 weeks to respond. 3 weeks‚Ä¶. I was told that I need to file an ex parte order. I have no idea how and a lawyer? Hahaha who has money for that? 

Aside from the fact that I‚Äôve lost my husband, and at this time, my daughter, I think I‚Äôm doing ok. I cry and feel sad, then I get angry, then back to sad. But I am holding it together for the most part. My husband was not only my very best friend, he was my caregiver because I have CHF among other things. I‚Äôve lost so much‚Ä¶. I miss hm terribly! 

What can I do? How can I get my daughter back if I can‚Äôt even begin to afford a lawyer? I need her and I believe she needs me. "
"(Tagged nsfw for talking about suicidal thoughts)

I'm having a bad depressive episode and i'm scared that my suicidal thoughts are starting to become intentions. Last night i spent half an hour sat on a window ledge. Today i had a bad panic attack at work and my boss told me to take some time off. I'm not sure i trust myself to keep myself safe since one minute i'm feeling depressed but mostly stable and the next i'm getting a loud ringing in my ears and a terrible urge to harm myself.

I live with my parents and i don't want to worry them. Currently trying to figure out how to break the news that i won't be working for a week or two. God knows how i'd handle talking to them about going to a mental health facility."
"Hi\~ ‚ù§Ô∏è

I've been pretty severely depressed since 2020 due to incredible difficulty securing a job during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. I was even unable to brush my teeth on some days, let alone cook, laundry, clean my room, and so on. While my mental health has improved since last month, it's only about a 10-15% improvement, and I'm still struggling with motivation issues! I've been feeling a bit of envy towards high-functioning depressed individuals because they are so productive, have good paying jobs, have a rich social life. I think my depression will never truly go away, and between this low functioning, sedentary lifestyle and a life where I can be self-sufficient, I'd rather pick the second lifestyle. It feels so far and unreachable for me, though, and I'm just wondering, what can I do to be a better person? Someone who is bold and takes initiative with meeting new people, networking (god I hate networking), and even being committed to hobbies instead of procrastinating and taking 3 hour naps. I do exercise, but not that much, maybe 3 times a week.

Trying to become well-rounded is absolutely overwhelming... ü•≤"
"It makes you ashamed. When you are in public and everyone smiles and conversate and have fun and you look like a dick head that can't even talk, people fucking notice that and some of them can judge or look how uncomfortable you are and feel like laughing in front of your face. I can't even imagine how embarrassed I could be in front of a group of friends or a girl that I'm supposed to meet or something. It's fucking shame over shame and acting confident and friendly like at work for example is even more embarrassing. It's an endless painful cycle"

"Hey everyone,

I'm sorry there's no other way to really say this without sounding gross but I've been really struggling with hygiene &amp; self care for a long time now; it just keeps getting worse. I wish I could say when's the last time I showered and washed my hair - but I realize I'd only embarress myself further even though I want to be honest so that I can feel seen and it would be telling as to how much I'm suffering. If you only knew the length of time. 

It's gotten so bad that I feel suicidal over it. I just do not have it in me to shower and care for myself. I don't feel like I have the energy really physically and mentally. I don't want want to be this way and it's embarressing. I don't know how I can ever lead a life - being a normal person that takes care of themselves, ever have a dating life, ever get married and lead a married life and work...if I cannot ever get over this. 

I want to be that woman that showers every day, takes care of her hair, does self care &amp; smells good. I used to at least try these things when I was younger but I'm too depressed. I literally do not know what to do anymore...

Even if let's say I finally shower and it works for one day I don't know how I can maintane it.

Needless to say everyone is ashamed of me as well. I am unwanted. 

Happy New Year!!! üôèüíô"

"Hey y'all. 

Im in the pits of depression is what I've been told. I somewhat feel like I don't believe that, and I'm just broken as a human (which is prolly what a depressed person would say). 

Right now, work feels too hard. I can't concentrate. I feel overwhelmed. I hate my life and am constantly stressed. Been like this for 3 months. I want to quit my job but know that's a bad idea.

How do you continue earning a living while really depressed. I've definitely felt suicidal in case you're wondering how severe my pit of despair is."
"Hi all,

Firstly, excuse me for chaotic writing but it is hard to gather my thoughts clearly. 

When I was 16 I made a terrible mistake of sending my naked picture with my face visible. One year later it was leaked online on Facebook, sent between multiple people. I was extremely ashamed of this but managed to get through it by not facing this. Everyone around me, from my closest friends to people who barely knew me saw it. From my side there was no revenge, no police, nothing, I just simply deleted my social media, disappeared from the internet and social life, had few close friends who tried to help me or simply ignore this facts. Some of them of course made fun of this which hurt a lot. After some years I was still thinking about it daily, especially when I was changing schools, jobs, meeting new people. I was extremely afraid and anxious they will eventually find out. Recently it got better, but from some time I have been working with pretty recognizable business people in my country. I‚Äôm still without any social media under my real name, but sometimes I‚Äôm on the photos or descriptions of business meetings, conferences etc. These things are a pretty big thing for me, as this are great opportunities. Right now I‚Äôm scared that someone in the future will leak the photos again ( now I may look a lot different ) and my future will be ruined. "
"I'll be honest and say sometimes I go without brushing my teeth for weeks. I work from home and am grateful because the idea of going out is a struggle.

"After 2 years i got better fml. Ill leave some tips and u guys can msg.

- ADs make u less sad not more happier.u have to produce ur own serotonin using exercise, sleep regularly, eat small meals frequently get at least 1 hr sunlight. Try do dif things, thats how neuroplastixity works.

-Not a single AD will work unless u do the ground stuff first

- supplements that are good: magnesium, vitamin d, vitamin b12, multi vitamin, coq10

- for every bad thought, theres a good thats just how balance works. Even tjo i didnt go therapy, basically u have to train urself to see the positive even like writing what things u did well today no matter how small etc. 

- depression is a belief, u have to change ur beliefs, if u think ur option is to die, then ofc itll be harder because u keep seeing it as the end. Believe ull get better and ull see more positives and opportunities. This made a difference

- make the most with what u have, not what u lack

- effexor is especially good for ppl who struggle w trauma ans flash backs. Abilify helped enhance these effects

- propanolol is good for performance anxiety

- with anxiety, constantly focus on ur surroundings and other ppl, dont have a single thought running thru ur head

I came from severe ptsd dep anxiety w suicide attempts and drug usage. U can do it."

"I‚Äôm 25F. 

This started in my teens, during my characteristic apathetic depressive epsiode, I wouldn‚Äôt move from the bed for several days, let alone brush my teeth. I wouldn‚Äôt drink water, or barely eat anything in such periods. I would sleep too much, too little, or at odd times, and would never go out of my room.

This led me to have gum problems, anal fissures and haemorrhoids, and a neck strain in my early 20s. These physical issues recur when I‚Äôm going through a depressive episode. 

I think I‚Äôll be having such episodes for a lot of my life. I want to know what other physical ailments do people develop due their depressive episodes/mental health issues so I can be more aware of my risks, or even preempt them. 

PS: I‚Äôm not on any medication for anything right now. I have PCOS. Infertility, obesity, diabetes, sexual dysfunction, gut issues are what I can estimate.

tldr; which diseases have you developed because of your battle with a mental illness, and how? "

"Me 16m and my boyfriend 15m have been bestfriends for a little than 6 months and dating for around 3 and a half.

And before anyone asks, yes he's been in counseling and therapy and his parents don't let him be home alone before this happened. He did self harm a couple weeks ago, but that was because he had the definitive worst day of his life. He seemed really happy and this came out of nowhere.

I dont do anything without it, i eat, i shower, i brush my hair, i bathe my dog, i go to classes, i workout, everything with my phone, my life revolves around it.

She's gone from extremely depressed (not showering or eating, brushing her teeth, rotting in bed) to the happiest i've ever seen her. Her hair was matted, every piece of clothing she owned was dirty, stacks of dirty dishes in her room, the list goes on. She's become so happy, almost euphoric. Smoking weed used to be an occasional thing (maybe once a month?) now she smokes everyday. She's splurging on unnecessary items, got her hair done, bought hundreds of new clothing and has even booked a solo trip overseas. 

Of course i'm happy because she's happy, but the last time she became this happy immediately after a depressive episode, she attempted to kill herself. She hates when anyone speaks regarding her mental state, so i'm completely lost here. I don't want to trigger her, but i'm so so worried we're going to have a repeat of last time and i'm even more worried she'll succeed. What's the best way to approach this situation?"
"Here‚Äôs a list of treatments u should look into ! I wanted to make this list incase someone has tried meds and therapy and thinks they have no hope. 
-EMDR therapy : If ur depression stems from traumatic experiences , emdr is a tool that will help u work and heal through trauma.
-TMS.Transcranial magnetic stimulation This is basically a non invasive procedure which is done in sessions over the course of 6-9 weeks 
-Ketamine therapy: A professional will administer an infusion and will monitor u. These require a few sessions as well .
-Somatic therapy: This is ideal for people who experience a lot of psychosomatic symptoms
-Group therapy : this personally helped me way more than one on one therapy , I think it‚Äôs something everyone with any type of issue in their lives could benefit from.
Don‚Äôt give up!"
"The best time in my life was when I was 19-21. Now I'm 28 and I feel like things have gone downhill. I really hope this isn't how it's going to be as I age further. For the people who are older and have more experience, did life get better or worse as you aged?"

"I asked a month in advance if he would get us reservations to a restaurant I wanted to try. Instead, he told me the day before he wasn't even going to get me anything. He said we don't have enough money, although he spends hundreds a month on eating out from breakfast alone and throws away the food he buys and never eats. He also spends hundreds on booze. I would've been happy with a bouquet of leaves and a message on our chalkboard. I even told him that, but he still didn't do anything.  Instead, for my birthday, I BOUGHT HIM new work pants and and entire new suit. I also bought him a massage gun and a back stretch thing for his back. Instead, FOR MY BIRTHDAY, I FOUND ANOTHER WOMAN'S SHIT IN MY HOUSE. Somehow I'm still the one that's done something wrong. He's always treated me like shit and I've let him walk all over me. I spent about a thousand on him for Christmas, but I also found out he had no intention of getting me anything. 

I want him gone so bad. I'm never going to be able to heal with him here. But I can't afford to live alone. The lease was just signed. I'm the only one with my name on the lease. The penalty to break the lease is 8 months rents lmfao, so I guess I'm staying. I can't legally kick him out. I think I can once the divorce is final. I found a cheap no contest divorce route. If I get him to sign, we file and divorce is final after 30 days. I'm pretty sure I can kick him out after that. But I don't think I can afford everything myself. I obviously can't afford to move out either. I told myself I was just going to try to pretend like I'd get over the other woman, just for the sake of having him here to help with the bills until I pay off my credit card debt, but I don't think I can handle the way he treats me. It's getting worse and worse. He makes me feel so bad, I contemplated revenge, and I'm not even that kind of person. He hurts me so much. Like most people that are taken over by people with narcissistic personality disorder, I am pretty isolated. I have no friends or family to help. I don't know what to do. I'm having the kind of depression that makes it hard for me to function. I'm starting a new job soon. Thank God, because I probably would've been fired from the one I have now if I hadn't already put in my notice. I have a therapist, but she's booked and it's not like I can just take off whenever I want to see her if I wasn't. I'm hurting so much. What do I do?"
"I have lived for 2 decades. I just want friends who are like me in terns of likes, interests, and personality. Like, seriously? There are 7 billion or whatever people in this world yet I never met someone like that. It's so hard to believe. And I prayed to god for such a friend yet nothing happened. I'm so tired!"
"My life is not going alright. It was all good for some years, I thought Depression was a thing i overcame, boom! Out of nowhere i relapsed. Everyday is becoming a struggle. 

For most of my life ive been a semi shutin. I want to be happy. Im compiling a list of things that might make me happy. What would make you happy if you magically started something today.

"This is my second time ever posting on Reddit, or social media in general. The first post was on a suicide page here after my then fianc√©e left me without rhythm or reason two years ago. Didn‚Äôt get any responses on that post and felt kind of foolish for seeking support or advice, but here I am trying again. 

Like the title says, I haven‚Äôt eaten anything in five days. I know I should, but the thought of food and eating makes me nauseous and feels gross. I‚Äôve had a couple bottles of water over the last five days, and even that felt like a task. 

I really hate this about myself, but I have a few mental health diagnoses. Bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder to name a couple. Got a history of being abused as a kid by family physically. Also sexual abuse. I‚Äôll mention I‚Äôm a man, and I know sometimes it‚Äôs hard to believe a male can be sexually assaulted, but it happens I promise, and it‚Äôs not always by other men. In my case it was a man and women all separate occasions though and not all during my childhood. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm hoping someone here has a little bit of advice. Umm if not that‚Äôs okay I guess. "
Just as the title say. Someone who's a failure and also dirt poor and depressed. Is there any hope for someone like me? Am I even allowed to dream? Or have hope? 
"My parents are pretty cool people. I mean atleast people said that they are. For years, for as long as I remember, I've been disciplined by them very.... thoroughly. They slapped me whenever I acted up, and even in public, it was common for them to shout and hit me. Once, I had to eat the food from the drains because I once threw it up- and they said that I shouldn't waste food. I was five at most. Now, I'm sixteen. They and their friends act like disciplining me in public and literally everywhere, was the sole reason that I'm decent. But even now, they hit me whenever I talk back. Whenever I try to communicate, it's like it's a wall. Then they say I don't treat them as my friends now. My father literally told me that I shouldn't have any respect, because I'm a 'kid' and I should never talk back, no matter how shitty the next person is. I'm confused. I know it's an Asian parents thing, but... isn't this abuse? I once did a convo with them expressing my distaste for abusers, and my father flipped out, accusing me of labelling them as abusers. He literally slapped me around, and called me ungrateful and that I wud turn out to be like my drug using cousin. I'm depressed, and I think it's all my fault I'm so pathetic."
"They don‚Äôt help at all, or at least texting them doesn‚Äôt, I‚Äôve sat there for 39 minutes talking to a bot who responds every 5 minutes even after I request to speak to a real human being, it never works and I feel like I‚Äôll never get help"

"I‚Äôve finished uni for summer and I‚Äôve recently been led on by a guy who I now have blocked, finding a job is harder than anything I can possibly imagine and I‚Äôm reminiscing over a situationship where I wasn‚Äôt as happy as my brain is making me believe I was. I have this heavy heart feeling and feel as though my brains being compressed. How do I stop feeling like I want to kill myself?"
"TW: suicide 

Okay, so recently I lost a friend to suicide. I already struggle with depression and this has made things so much worse. Struggling to get out of bed and brush teeth. 

Chores? Feeding myself? Forget about it. All I want to do is get drunk and cry.

I took a few days off of work and am trying to recoup for when I do have to go back in. I‚Äôm heading to the grocery store soon. I have autoimmune conditions which means I have to be super picky about the foods that I eat (no gluten, no soy, no beans). Do you guys have any recommendations for foods that would fall under this category? I can‚Äôt think right now. 

Edit: would like recommendations for foods that are super easy. Think like one or two steps at best. "
I think I avoid doing most of the work not because I‚Äôm lazy. But I think scared and lack clarity which makes it worse. So I feel stuck to a point I just become frozen. 
"I've struggled with depression for the past 10 years or so and it has definitely been easy to deal with at times and impossible at others, but now that I'm 20 and I'm in my first semester at uni I hate what my daily life is like and I'm starting to feel like due to my depression I'm kinda fated to mediocrity.
I didn't really have a normal school experience (due to the depression but also other factors) and so I didn't really get into a Good College to get a Good Degree, so now I don't really know what to do with myself really. 
I'm kinda having to come to terms with the fact that maybe a four year degree isn't going to work for me, and also with the disappointment that comes with that. 
I don't really have a dream school or a dream career or any dreams for that matter. I just want somewhere to live and a job that doesn't suck. But if I think about that for longer than a second everything I did and everything I went through to get here feels so worthless. It was all for nothing. I nearly died, multiple times, trying to get through school and trying to get into this university and now that I'm here I don't even want to be here anymore. It seems childish but I hate it because it's so boring. It feels draining and pointless and I can't motivate myself by saying ""at least I'll have a good job by the end of this"" because I probably won't.
How do people do it? How do people get themselves through college? How do people handle their jobs? 
I don't think it's for me. I don't think I could do it even if I wanted to, and I don't.

"I remember wanting to jump from the 4th (and top) floor of my building at the age of 8. Today, I am 19 and I am still here (despite myself). I feel a deep malaise within me and it tortures me daily. I'm already dead inside. Nothing stimulates me anymore, nothing appeals to me anymore, nothing animates me anymore. Also, I can't stand much (the constraints, the lack of possibilities...) I have become antisocial and unemployable. I really don't see how this insignificant story of mine could end well. Dying seems to me to be the best solution."

I‚Äôm not going to say to much of what I‚Äôve have done as it‚Äôs been a journey. But now basically the project coming to an end and they can‚Äôt get the funding for it because it was funded by the European council (bloody brexit). I‚Äôve taken such a shine to my support worker and I believe has a soft spot for me too. I‚Äôm just so emotional today as it was the last activity on the project and my support worker has had to apply for a different role meanwhile I‚Äôll get a new support worker.

I just wanted to hug her today and cry my eyes out but it was never the right time. She also lives on the same road as me so she alwapicked me up. Little things like that are massive for me. All this will be gone or has gone and next year I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm gonna do.

Maybe if I say it to someone I might actually finish it.. Problem is I can't take a break because then I'll stop. Adhd :(
"So, first post!

Sitting here night after night now drinking alone while my wife and kids are asleep and for months, not having anyone to talk to without feeling like a burden..figured maybe someone here can at least read my vent.. And hope that helps. 

40\M, married 17 years, 5 boys. 

I try be a good father to my kids.... Think Ive done ok so far as they are all respectful, liked, kind and smart. Handsome little ass holes they are.

So, back story. About 8 years ago, my wife came to me and told me she had feelings for another man. She knew it was wrong and a stupid crush and went to counseling to hopefully get it all worked out. We'd been married for 9 years and it came out of nowhere. Guy isnt a close friend, but an acquaintance I've known for years. Rich, muscular etc etc. This crushed me but I wanted to make it work. Obviously, I was missing something she wanted.

Anyway, ended up getting 'through' this patch over the years and she's says she moved past this.

Now, it's been 8 years, and it still kicks me in the balls almost daily. I can usually move past it because she's loving enough and giving up isn't an option.

My problem lately is... Its been getting to me more and more to the point I'll sit randomly staring at the stars for hours at night drinking until wee early am while she sleeps because it F's with my mind again.

I can't bring it up to her, because I don't want to keep bringing up the past that hurts her too. My best friends know of the issue and I talked with them a while ago about how it was killing me but never really got follow up. I get it.. Wtf do you even say? So I don't bother them with it anymore. So lately, it's been easting at me a bit. The more I think about how chances are it could happen again, the more distance I become, which makes it worse. I don't know how the duck the break my cycle.
I don't want to show her I'm broken, because no woman wants to see her man as a 'fragile' little man that can't supper her.

I'm so stuck.. The worse I feel, the more distant I get hoping for some hope, the leas I see, so the worse it gets.

I've surface talked to a psychiatrist about my issues (husband and wife team that my wife used her) but its a religious team and the answer is always 'pray'. Now
. I'm pretty religious, but if a Dr told me to pray to heal my cancer, I wouldn't think that's a pretty good answer to my issue.

Anyway, I said my bit. I'm not suicidal FYI... And I have zero interest in leaving my wife or my kids. Guess I just needed to vent.

Anyone have comments? This probably just get lost in the abyss of reddit...... "
"If you are depressed, something probably upset you, or pushed you to your limits. Some people may never experience it, while others may live like this for what feels like forever. However, you are never alone. Although it may feel like you are at times, you will always have at least one person who will love you no matter what. Although this may be a bit corny, its the truth. If you are depressed, there is nothing a stranger on reddit can do to help expect tell you that things will be okay eventually. I am 19 now, but as a kid, I constantly fell in and out of depression. I felt like my friends were fake, like my grades weren't enough, like everyone hated me. But as I got older I realized that none of that was true. I was a good student, I just needed motivation. I had real friends, I was just lost in my own head. Some people may have hated me, but I was surrounded with people who loved me. What I'm trying to say is that you shoulden't get lost in your own head. Sometimes life is just hard, but please don't push people away, harm others, or hurt yourself over it. Even though we hide it well, everyone has their own problems to deal with, some people have many small ones, others have really big ones, and so on. Nobody's life is perfect, even if it seems like it. If you'd like to face your problems alone, thats fine, but you don't have to. If you have someone in your life whom you trust enough to share everything with, you can ask them, or anyone you think can help you. Helping people deal with things like what you're going through has become so normal that therapists have been made, just to help people, so don't judge yourself, or think something is wrong with you for everything you are going through. I know a random reddit post can't change you're entire life, but please dont do something you'll one day regret. I promise you things will get better, and I hope you'll belive me. If there's anything I can do or say on here, to help, please let me know. I remember what it was like going through all this, and I belive I can at least listen to whatever you need to say. Thank you for reading my post, and I hope you have an amazing day, or night!"

"Alright, context mid30s F diagnosed with depression very young. Two attempts and hospitalizations as a kid. Jumped around from depression to manic depression with no mania and tried about 30 meds. 

In my late 20s diagnosed with ADHD and ASD and mild depression and haven't had more then a few days of ugh for... 8 years. Currently only on ADHD meds. Attempted combo of ADHD meds and wellbutrin 3 years ago, but the instant suicidal thoughts were too much even if they supposedly wear off in 6-12 months...

Well now it's back with a vengeance.

And like, I WANT to do stuff. Fun stuff, to a lesser extent chores and stuff, etc. But I am so paralyzed and exhausted I can't. I can barely charge my phone. I haven't gone to (fucking ONLINE) classes in 5 weeks. I haven't done dishes in 3 weeks. I can hardly force myself to get up to eat food and pass out on the couch regularly. When I was in classes, I would fall asleep in the middle of them and I just loose huge chunks of time. I zone out completely, like I don't exist. I barely feel my emotions, I'm frustrated and overwhelmed and I know that but I can barely interact with it. 

I was feeling like shit about 10 months ago but it's tanked worse and worse and I don't know what to do.

My doctor says everything's fine on blood tests, and I really REALLY don't wanna go back to SSRIs because they've never helped. How the fuck do I get out of this when I can only spend 2 hours max out of bed and only like, 15 minutes functional. "
"Hello, (Anonymous). (20yo M). Just recently few days ago, a friend of mine had commented suicide . After I heard of this, I rushed to my parents home from the gym to ask for support and console me. When I got there, I told them that he died, my father then made things worse by saying in an attitude ‚ÄúWell he probably OD‚Äôd or something‚Äù after that I went on FB calling him out politely asking for respect. My mother then went on for days after that with laughing emoji gifs saying that I was gossiping about him, Which I took that she was making fun of the death. And Monday she hacked into my google account without my knowledge or consent because she was concerned about my safety. Texting me that ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù If they truly loved me, would they not hack into my google? spread crap on Facebook making a clown show of my friends death? I went to 2 counselors on the same day and one pastor, which did not seem to care. I lost a good friend, even without thinking about it. It still controls my life.

"I‚Äôm bitter about how other people have legit normal lives. I feel resentment toward the ones who‚Äôve never been bullied or harassed at all. I‚Äôm envious of the ones who don‚Äôt have any trauma. 

I feel these things most especially when those normal people tell me that I can only save myself. They tell me that I need to just think positively and I‚Äôll get over it all. I feel so offended at how they seem to trivialize all that suffering I experienced and all the consequential pain I‚Äôm currently feeling. They tell me it‚Äôs in the past and I should stop thinking about it and move on, but they‚Äôre not suffocating every day from the fear of it all happening again (because it‚Äôs happened to me several times before).

I know that fundamentally I do need to forget in order to move on. I need to accept that I can‚Äôt change the past and just walk forward. I‚Äôm so insufferably self-aware so of course I know it. But it‚Äôs so fucking difficult to do.

And this resentment and envy I have, it‚Äôs ruining me and exhausting me every time I think about it. I basically hate everyone right now because of it. I feel numb all the time and idk if I even feel any love anymore. 

How do I stop it? Should I just never talk to anyone about my problems ever again? What do I do?

My English is not perfect and I have dyslexia, so I hope that you all can read it. 

My boyfriend had been fysical sick past weekend. 
He told me that he had su√Øcide thoughts last friday. 

I told him I was very proud of him for admidding it to me and not doing it. 
I always ask him if I can do something for him, but the past days it was, no I dont think so, but he says that all the time.

I tried to make him spend the night with me so he was not alone. He did that two nights. 
I also tried to distract him with nice things to do, and asked him if he wanted to do something, play a game, go outside. All of that he did not want. 

I pushed him to talk to his therapist about how he felt, his own therapist is on vacation, so he told the back up. He did not do anything, just said, that he wanted to see him more often. 

Then this afternoon I got a text if I was already tutoring, I wasn‚Äôt. 

He texted me that I had to come over asap, and I had to bring the key, because he did not know if he was able to open the door. 
He also told me not to be scared of the way I would find him. 

I called an ambulance and drove over there. H√® did indeed try to end his live. He drank halve a bottle of vodka, and took a lot of pills. 
I held him while he was throwing up in the sink. The ambulance was there before me. 
He had cut himself on his arms, and left a note not to call his family if he survived and that he hoped it worked this time because he could no longer do this. 

He was brought to the ambulance and I drove with him to the hospital. 
He said he did not regret it. 
He is doing better, gets the care he needs and they are gonna contact his therapist to make a plan, a better plan. 

I was not allowed to stay the night, so I went home to my own place, threw all my alcohol away, and put al the alcohol glasses away. 
I don‚Äôt want him feeling triggered. 

I want to do so much more for him, I just want to take his pain away and not make him feel so bad. 

But now I am home, trying to sleep. Wondering what I could have done better, and what I can do for him now. 

He wanted to come home with me tonight, but I convinced him to stay in the hospital because he could get worse in the night. 

I just love him so so much. I hope he survives the night. 

A part in me says, you think he is mad that I saved him? 
Was it better for him if I would have let him go? 

I do not want to make this about myself, but I am wondering if there is anything I can do for him‚Ä¶"
"I just really need some hope as I‚Äôm struggling with severe depression.  When I say I wanna hear stories about getting better from depression, I‚Äôm not just talking about people who no longer have depression, even stories of yourself or people you know improving even if they still have depression. 

Thank you in advance to anyone who comments, please don‚Äôt feel like you have to comment though. Only comment if you want. :)

"He destroyed my mental health years ago, he was an addict and self destructive person. He abandoned me after 6 years together and years later came back, I was stupid and believed him. We were together again for around 2 years and did the same. 

He was my trigger to my mental health to be destroyed, since then I have been a people pleasing, without boundaries, self destructive and now I am sick and on my lowest being suicidal for a year.

Today I felt I had to write him to let him know he destroyed me, I wrote a letter, I am kind of afraid to send him because I don‚Äôt know how he can react but I need him to know this before I probably kms soon.

I am 29F, have no friends, no social life, no personal life, nobody to care and I'm losing my mind. I have a job and earn my own money. Here in my country, we tend to stay with our family. So I'm staying with my mom and brother. My brother has it all. Great friends, amazing partner and I am so proud of him for that. All I want is someone I can call my friend. The loneliness is eating me everyday. Don't get me wrong, I love being by myself sometimes. But its just, I wish I had somebody. I cry most days on my own, wishing I had someone and from past 3 weeks it has been unbearable. Can somebody please help me?"
"Hey all you people! All you smart beautiful people!! 

No matter how bad it looks right now, 
no matter how much you are hurting inside, 
no matter how hard the path ahead looks, 
no matter what happened in your past 

You can change one thing right now and make a positive change in your life. 

Drink some water, eat something, get some exercise and fresh air, get some rest. 

You got this.

"Hi. I'm 28 m. I have been suffering from anxiety and depression my whole life. 

I have tried lots of different depression medication, none of them giving me, significant effect on my mood. I exercise every other day (running, cycling and lifting weights). I take different vitamin supplements and Omega-3 fatty acid supplement. 

I've been in the ketamine treatment for 8 times now. It only gives short term boost to my mood.

I'm bitter, angry, sad, fearful and jealous 80% of the time I'm awake. Even videogames do not help me distract myself from these feelings.

My medication for depression currently is following

50 mg of agomelatine,
200 mg of Quetiapine 

15-45 mg of Oxazepam (Benzodiazepine) everytime anxiety gets too overwhelming)

If you guys know any medication , drug, substanc, activity  that actually has a positive long term effec on mood, please tell me.

"Does anyone have a high functioning depression? Like I can still shower, get out of bed, go about my day but the whole day I‚Äôm ruminating, spiraling just thinking about how I don‚Äôt enjoy anything , if I should be on different meds (currently on lexapro which is clearly not working lol), not really feeling myself, not finding interest in things I usually love, and it‚Äôs like I just try to get through everyday and I don‚Äôt wanna break down vs. living and thriving as I should be. I should say this is not situational depression and these feelings do not reflect the aspects of my life. I believe I have a chemical imbalance but either way im so sick of dealing with these feelings. I have a hard time being alone as well because when im alone im like uncomfortable almost existing and trying to distract myself? You know how people naturally~just live ~ my depressed anxious brain doesn‚Äôt allow this. It‚Äôs like im anxious about being depressed and scared of my own self and that I‚Äôll never feel normal again. It sounds so crazy to be in this cycle of constant checking if I feel normal, not feeling normal, wondering if I‚Äôll be depressed forever, how can I get out of this, do I need new meds, like constant overthinking all surrounding my mental health.

"We had been dating for 4 years. We were long-distance but made it work by visiting each other at least a few times a year. We kept our relationship a secret from our family since his family is Muslim and I didn't want my family to worry about me. The first two years he just could not stay loyal to me. He had a porn addiction, talked to other women, tried to get with other women despite being with me. Eventually, I caught him again and it was too much for me, I thought I fell out of love and I left him. I came back because I still loved or at least cared about him. My love for him grew back but I also developed intense anger issues. Around 1 year later, his addiction healed and he stopped pursuing women entirely. But even if something reminded me about his cheating problems again, I would blow up in anger towards him. I called him horrible things and made him slap himself. I thought it was justified because he cheated on me and when he would come over, he would hit me too.  


Then the day of the solar eclipse I woke him up through facetime and we got into some stupid argument about organ donations. He got so pissed and he left me. He said he was miserable with me and wanted to work on himself. He told me he completely fell out of love with me. He said things to me like how he doesn't care if I was dead and the more he looks at me, the more hates me. But he also told me there was a small chance he would come back to me but he didn't want to be in any relationship anymore. This was so sudden to me it was nothing like him. He was really sweet and patient to me every day before this. We had been getting a little distant recently but I thought it was just college stress and distractions.   


Later on a mutual friend texted me telling me about how he has been talking to another girl and he was already with her the day he left me. Since we kept our relationship a secret, he was basically my only closest friend and person in my life. My other friends were just classmates and I don't know them as well. I abandoned my hobbies and my life for him. I gave him everything I had. I know I treated him cruelly and that it's my fault I feel horrible. 

But without him I just don't want to live. My only motivation in life was to keep going so that I could get a stable job and fund our lives together.  I actually love him so much. I want to commit suicide but I don't want to disappoint my parents. I can't talk to my parents, I can barely talk to my friends. I have nobody and no will to live. It's been almost a week and it feels like it's been forever without him. He texts me once awhile just to tell me he can't respond to me on messages. That's the only thing he says to me. I don't know how I will keep going. I have completely lost motivation. I can barely eat one meal a day without throwing up and I have to force myself to drink water. My grades are dropping and I may be kicked out of my nursing program if I fail my finals. Every time I walk into my clinicals I think of using my patient's meds or tools to kill myself. I purposely walk into the bad part of the city or at night and hope something or someone kills me. I have given it time and it hasn't gotten better, just worse. All I can think about is him. Does it really ever get better? How long does it take? Is it even worth it?"

"Just like the tittle says im having the worst time of my life for the last 2years mentally. I 24M Ex19 were engage and due circumstances on both sides things did not go as planned, now a year after we went our separate ways we started talking back again in friends way manner and everything seemed fine, but right after 2weeks of talking again I receive the call of her passing by our mutual best friend in common. I tried my best to contact with her cause I didn‚Äôt wanna believe it. But until families and friends started uploading their photos together with her it‚Äôs when all hit me hard, I‚Äôm talking about being in bed for 2weeks cause I lost my appetite and was just beating myself into believing that it was my fault cause I was the who broke our not contact, but I just missed her for whole year and even tho we were engaged and that we broke up, she was my very first best friend that I had in another country. Now the thing is since we were just talking to each other her family did not wanted to see me or know anything of me for whatever reason and it felt like I couldn‚Äôt say my good byes to her. But ever since that happen every year around the time of that ‚Äúanniversary‚Äù cause I don‚Äôt know how to call it everything with me seems off like I don‚Äôt laugh like I usually do, I lost all my will and power to grieve a girl who I couldn‚Äôt even say a proper goodbye over 2years ago.

" 

I'm  not going to make an overly detailed explanation because I'm not in the  right mental state but how do you deal with being socially isolated? My  circumstances are that, I have very few people in my life who I get to  socialize with and lately for the past month or so they have been very  distant and unavailable. It is not them having malice or anything, just a  circumstance of our lives. However, those few friends I had were  basically all I had... and now all I do is sit in my room and be  depressed with no avenue to talk to anybody just about ever. I have no  personal connection to anybody right now.

Before anybody suggests things that won't work...

I  don't have a car, can't go places. I don't have money. can't buy  things. I can't fix these issues at the moment. I do not do well online  with others as I find most people to just be mean spirited and it only  makes my situation worse anytime I try to interact with people like  that... I just don't know what to do"

"I have been battling the most intense depression I've ever felt for the past year.  I'm having a rare moment of clarity and optimism and wanted to share.

This sounds stupid, but I was watching my partner play Zelda: Breath of the Wild and there's an NPC who tells Link that he has dedicated his life to researching shrines. This hit me somewhere deep because I realized that I've dedicated my life to nothing in spite of having quite a few passions (well, when depression and anxiety aren't all-consuming). 

This realization HURT like a knife in the gut. I realized that we all dedicate our life to something, and I had been dedicating mine to fear! I saw it so clearly. I am in my thirties, so that is a long time. I realized that if I wanted to get better, I had to dedicate my life to something else, something fulfilling. Of course I have that voices in my head that says I'm too old to change anything, I've already wasted my youth, it's too late .... I'm doing by best to ignore her because I am the youngest I will ever be again.

To start, I have been debating whether or not to quit my job. My father (who I have a complicated relationship with) is my boss, and my fear of disappointing him prevents me from quitting even though it is literally giving me panic attacks in the night because it is so stressful and I am so unfilled by it. But those fear-based thoughts come in: I'll never be able to buy a house. I'm 35 and don't have a proper career and I am a failure. My dad will convince me that I am making a huge mistake and I am powerless to stand up to him .... I realized, thanks to that NPC, that I have been dedicating prime years of my life to a horrible job that I hate!!! This is my LIFE. I can choose to turn my attention and resources to things that matter!!! All of a sudden I felt a determination and a hope that I could change my life. It's small, but it's enough to at least find the energy to reach out for piano lessons, something I've wanted to do for a while but felt frustrated that I am a beginner and therefore a failure at it.   
I've also been reading about vulnerability (Pema Chodron and Brene Brown). I realize that I must turn TOWARDS fear and discomfort if I am going to get out of this hole and stop keeping myself small. I am so scared to tell my dad that I am resigning. But I think that the fact that I am so scared of it means that it is the best thing I can do for myself. It is the most vulnerable I can be, so it probably means that it is really worthwhile. I am also really scared of being a beginner at piano. But if I am vulnerable it means that I can learn the piano and maybe become pretty good! I'll at least be better than I am now.

"My name is Yamen Nashwan, and I used to live in a beautiful four-story house in Beit Hanoun, Gaza. My life was full of promise‚ÄîI had a job, dreams for the future, and a close-knit group of friends and family. But all of that was taken away from me when the conflict erupted.

The place I once called home is now just a memory. My family and I were forced to flee, and now we‚Äôre living in a small tent in Rafah City. There are 27 of us crammed into this tiny space, including 13 children and a newborn. Every day, we struggle to find food, warmth, and safety. Loved ones.

 The dreams I had for the future now feel like distant memories, overshadowed by the daily fight for survival. My friends, my community‚Äîso many have been scattered, displaced, or worse. The laughter and joy that once filled my life have been replaced by fear and uncertainty.The hardest part is the loss of the intangible things‚Äîthe memories of better times, the bonds with friends and neighbors, and the sense of security that came from knowing we had a home. These things can never be replaced.

Life in Gaza is not just a struggle for survival‚Äîit‚Äôs a constant reminder of what we‚Äôve lost. I wanted to shed light on the harsh reality we face every day. It‚Äôs a life filled with pain, but also with a small, flickering hope that one day, things might change."

"I am 29 single male living alone and in between jobs, have no social support or close friends or family. I have severe depression with weekly or biweekly phases between total shutdown in bed 24/7 and barely able to communicate and move a bit outside. 

I also have PTSD, ADHD, anxiety and possibly ASD. 

I ghost the few people messaging during my shutdown phase for a bit over a week, those would be acquaintances, casual friends, and people am talking to in dating apps.

 Messaging back as if nothing happened and excuses doesn't work because we would be messaging constantly and daily and I would just stop, and being honest also doesn't work because I don't know any of them well enough and everytime people run away. 

What do I tell everyone I ghosted during that period?"

"I (19f) have severe depression, meds barely keep me alive and I've tried everything that people say helps them (therapy, working out, diet changes). I've been debating on posting for a while and keep rewriting because idk how much information is acceptable to put in a post like this.

But to summarize my problem: I can't hold even a part time job for more than three months. How are yall with depression able to hold a job, especially a full time one? 

A little more info: When I work I'm miserable because I hate working, when I don't work I'm miserable because I feel like a disgusting leech. I don't have any college degree, I dropped out because I couldn't do any of the work without breaking down, and I have very limited experience because I can't hold a job.

As a legal adult, it feels shitty to not be able to hold a part time job and to freak out at just the thought of full time. Plus, I haven't been working long enough to qualify for disability social security. 

Am I just a lost cause? I feel like I only have the choice of going to have to suck it up and bounce from job to job, working for three months, or give up on life completely.

Thanks in advance."
" I have avoidant personality disorder, which is sucking the life out of  me. I was almost selectively mute in school, and now at 26 I'm about as  successful as my high school bullies said I would be. They said ""you  should be put to sleep"", ""you'll be alone forever"", ""you're the biggest  loser in the school"" etc. Now I have no job, friends, relationship or  anything to look forward to just like they said.  
My worst mistake was  going to college. I have an IT degree but my social and mental issues  are so bad I realized I was fooling myself around junior year but with  the sunk costs weighing in me I completed it anyway.

I'm probably never going to  get a job relevant to my degree with a four year gap and all my other  issues. I'm a black sheep and my siblings don't speak to me, which  doesn't help, but I understand why.  
Meds, psychiatrists, therapists  all haven't helped, and I don't think I'm ever going to find a partner  if I'm such a loser, which feels like the final nail in the coffin. A  lonely life forever. I even get anxiety ordering food much less dealing  with an interview. My life is doomed.    "
"I know that we all have our own problems. However, I‚Äôve witnessed countless times how much easier people‚Äôs lives are compared to mine. I have two younger cousins who had it easier their whole lives with no bullying, no mental health issues, supportive and financially stable parents, they had lots of guidance, they have part-time jobs and keep them, they‚Äôre doing what they want in the colleges they chose, they have girlfriends, they have all the latest gadgets, and, when they have the time, they‚Äôre able to travel wherever they want cus they not only have they‚Äôre parents‚Äô money but also their own savings. 

I know other people as well who are successful, with easy lives, lots of guidance,  with no mental health issues and who‚Äôve been  financially stable their whole lives and who are probably earning more now. A lot of them living their dreams.

I feel insecure and like I‚Äôm never gonna have that. My whole life and even now I‚Äôve been financially unstable. My parents never guided me at all and they had no idea how it works in the USA. They were too busy working overtime. They gave me the basics and education. But I was all on my own basically with no guidance. I didn‚Äôt even know what I didn‚Äôt know. I still don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôm trying to research and understand and I just can‚Äôt help feeling like it‚Äôs all too late for me. My dreams are basically broken now and I‚Äôve actually settle for less this time.

So now I feel so angry and depressed and regretful and wishing I was never born to begin with. 

Please someone help me. Please tell me how to ignore these thoughts because I also realize it‚Äôs pointless cus thinking this way won‚Äôt change my reality. But I can‚Äôt help ruminating over this and feeling like I‚Äôm at rock-bottom then getting extremely depressed and anxious like right now. One of the reasons I can‚Äôt help it either is cus I‚Äôm living with those 2 cousins, cus their parents told me to move in with them and study at a local college. But now that I‚Äôm here I regret it immensely, and I want to die.

"ADD (or ADHD as im hearing its now being called) depression, anxiety, and working 12 hour shifts are what im struggling with. I get home most days and just lay down in bed to ignore the stuff that needs to be done around the house. 

Dishes are piled all over the kitchen and ive skipped meals because i just dont want to deal with them.

I only do laundry because i dont want my coworkers to comment on if i smell bad. I also take quick ""whore baths"", jump in the shower for five ish mintues and just wash the smelly bits then get out.

The rest of the house is just cluttered with things that could either be tossed, or just needs to be put away but i always just end up tossing them where ever then stare at them angrily later on.

"I started writing messages from life to myself. to remind me that I have worth, purpose and that I am needed. here is the first message. I hope these help you as well

Hey there, it's Life speaking.

It's time we had a proper introduction.

Consider this a belated welcome to the grand adventure you call life.

Better late than never, right?

I am here to remind you of the beauty of life,

To remind you of your worth and your value. Well, I did tell you all of this at birth.

But a lot has happened since then. What has stayed the same is who you are. You have an essential role to play here.

You came full of joy, love and gifts to express to the world. You might have been convinced otherwise by the world around you.

So consider this your official reminder:

You are loved, adored, and appreciated beyond words. You are needed. Otherwise, you would not be here. You are still as treasured and as unique as you were when you arrived in this world.

Welcome to planet Earth, little one!

(sorry, I keep forgetting that you're all grown up now.)

Love,

Your new secret all-mighty pen-pal."
"I have been dealing with depression my entire life but it has never been as bad as it is right now. I have a therapist, I have had several doctor appointments with my GP about it and am trying different meds but nothing seems to be working. I took myself to the ER, that was infuriating at how unhelpful that was. I love my therapist but I can't be there everyday. I read a lot of books and listen to podcasts just to keep my mind occupied but I'm exhausted of trying to stay on top of all the dark thoughts. I'm unbelievably tired of fighting this disease. 

I have a few loved ones that I talk to but honestly none of them seem to understand and they just want me to snap out it. It's at the point where talking to anyone just does more harm than help because I get so frustrated when they act like it's so easy to just be positive and grateful. They don't seem to be getting the severity of it either. 

What helps you feel better? I always thought asking for help was the answer but I've been banging my head against the wall doing that. 

Also has anyone had any luck explaining how awful this is to loved ones who don't get it? I feel like they all think it's just my fault and that is hurting me beyond belief.

I hide the hell out of what‚Äôs really going on inside me! What I‚Äôd love to scream out loud!

But I have to pretend to be ok. Pretend to be someone I‚Äôm not. live a life that is fake and not mine.

I‚Äôm tired as F! I‚Äôm over it! It hurts so f‚Äôing much!

There is just so much I want to say but no one gives a f to listen! No one gives a f about me!

Why am I not worthy of anyone to love or care about me when I give so much to so many people.

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm invisible!!!!!!"
"I need advice/help. How do I start cleaning my house? It's getting bad. I can still walk on the floor and stuff but I haven't used the sink or the dishwasher to wash dishes in weeks. My house is quite trashed and I am starting to get a lot of nasty critter-crawlers. It's quite embarrassing and humiliating, which makes my mental health worse. My depression feels like a positive incline, but it yo-yo's its way up. Trying to find a way to do it without getting overwhelmed."
"I constantly experience most if not all of the symptoms of depression on a daily. My mom doesn't believe me and says I am just an unmotivated slob. This really hurts because I want to be clean, professional and motivated but I don't have the emotional/physical energy to do so. I have times when I have enough energy but it drains fast and then the cycle repeats. Tomorrow I am going to get checked by a medical professional while she is away at work hopefully this can shine light on my situation. Any advice?"
"Life will get better. You won't be plagued with nightmares in your sleep anymore one day. You won't dread waking up anymore one day. You won't be weighed down by the weight of your regrets one day.

It's not so far away, that day. It's waiting for you to meet it. Take the step towards it too. Let no one stop you till you reach it because you deserve what's yours to take."
"I spend nearly all my time alone when I‚Äôm not at work. I want so bad to have one solid person in my life. But I literally cannot nurture relationships anymore. If they become too close I find away to ruin it or I just go ghost. I find it extremely draining to try to keep up with friends and even family. I have only ever found one person in my life that I connected with deeply and didn‚Äôt feel drained by. Sadly that person is no longer in my life. Sometimes, I find my self comparing others to that person and I am somewhat convinced that I‚Äôll never find a connection like that again. "
"I‚Äôm going through a tough time right now in life, especially with work. It‚Äôs constantly bringing me down, very toxic work environment. I have an end date to quit in a month or so with a plan. I don‚Äôt want to quit before then because I‚Äôm waiting for a big commission payout. 

My boyfriend is tired of me always complaining about work and always being depressed, and just seeing the way it brings me down. I feel like I can‚Äôt be my authentic self around him because I have to pretend like everything is fine and that I‚Äôm feeling okay which couldn‚Äôt be 100% further from the truth. 

Have you been left by loved ones before because of this? Or have you found some people that stick around no matter what? 

I understand that you don‚Äôt want to feel like you‚Äôre a burden on people but I feel like if they love you they‚Äôd understand. "
"I have had problems with depression/anxiety almost 40 years now. I am having depression pretty bad today, and sometimes it has helped me to write about my thoughts and symptoms.

"Hello. I‚Äôll try to keep this short, but a lot has been happening in my life. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to read and help me.

I‚Äôm depressed. It started after a severe climate event hit my state in May. Everything stopped working, thousands lost everything, and my university stayed closed for two months. Most of my friends left town to be with their families, but I stayed because my dad was in the hospital, and my mom was going through treatment for what we now know is ALS. Since I‚Äôm a med student, I volunteered at shelters almost daily, which kept me busy. I also volunteered at the pediatric oncology unit, where I met an 11-year-old boy. We got along well, and he became very attached to me. He felt safe with me, and I was with him during scary procedures. His mom invited me to be his godfather, which I was honored to accept.

Then, two nurses, disliked by many families, reported me for ‚Äúinterfering with their work‚Äù and claimed the boy refused procedures unless I was there. That wasn‚Äôt true‚Äîhe felt safer with me but never refused treatment. I was asked to stop volunteering, and all the projects I had started were shut down. Since it‚Äôs where I study, I didn‚Äôt want to cause problems by fighting back.

Between the disaster, losing my volunteer work, and not seeing my friends for two months, I became depressed. 

Then my dad died.
We were very close, and it was devastating. 

What kept me going was the boy‚Äôs love and trust. I did everything for him and his mom‚Äîbringing them food, keeping him entertained, writing a comic book about his story, playing online games with him (since I couldn't be there in person because of his treatment, but I could always hand things to his mom), buying him toys and games, calling him to play the guitar and sing to him when he was feeling sad... if he asked me for something, I would gladly drive to 5 different places anytime of the day so I could find everything he asked. I left my ipad with him the whole time so he could play and watch stuff. I encouraged him, I checked on him everyday, I would often tell him how brave he was and how proud of him everyone was and how loved he was by everyone... He trusted me to help with everything, and that gave me purpose. I supported his mom too, raising funds for them and encouraging her to learn new skills. And of course, I've never asked for anything in return. Nothing. Because being there for him and feeling loved was enough for me.

But during his last treatment, when they were in isolation for over 30 days, they began to grow distant. He stopped reaching out, and by the end of his stay, he barely talked to me except to ask me to bring him food, which I did almost every day. Now that he‚Äôs home, it feels like they‚Äôre tired of me. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd ever text me if I didn‚Äôt reach out first. I haven't seen him since he was discharged because they just won't invite me anymore. Still, his mom keeps telling me everything is fine and I have no reason to be worried that they won't like me anymore. But everything is different.

Meanwhile, I returned to school, and it‚Äôs been the hardest year of my life. I‚Äôve been staying up all night studying, relying on coffee and Ritalin (plus two antidepressants). I‚Äôm exhausted and cry every day. The only thing that kept me going was feeling loved and needed by him. Now that‚Äôs gone, and I feel worthless and the loneliest I've ever felt. I just want to feel loved again."
"im so tired of this life. i just opened up to my mom about my mental health struggles and she acted out against me. Scoffing at me, rolling her eyes, even going to the point of stating she didn‚Äôt know if she wanted to ‚Äúsmack me over the face or hug me‚Äù. That i was ‚Äúupsetting the family‚Äù and that I should be more considerate of the monetary cost this would cause when I brought up therapy. Ive tried to bring this up to her before but she claims I never have and starts to criticize me on other habits of my life. When I tried to explain its reactions like this which made me nervous to talk to her, she just called me ignorant. 

I have struggled for quite some time but my mental health has worsened due to the breakup of the long term significant other. I‚Äôve tried to reach out to them but it seems as though they hate me, they blocked me on some platforms and won‚Äôt communicate back to me. my mom just criticizes the relationship I had, discrediting it and shaming me and him. 

I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. I don‚Äôt want to be alone. I don‚Äôt want to open up to people just to have them shame me for my mental struggles or relationship in which that person was my best friend. 

I‚Äôm so tired and I just want the world to stop and I‚Äôve been thinking about it quite a bit more. Although quite horrible, I find myself fantasizing that I would get sick and be hospitalized or have a tragic accident in which I either never wake up again or wake up without memory, or better with my ex by my side again. 

I don‚Äôt want to wake up tomorrow. "
"My counselor is saying I‚Äôm showing signs of treatment resistant depression, anti depressants have little to no effect and basic self care and counseling aren‚Äôt doing anything, what happens next if these things are ineffective?"
It‚Äôs my second day and I‚Äôm so depressed and stressed and anxious I cry constantly and have to fight back tears in every class. I missed a class yesterday cause I had to go cry. I don‚Äôt want to drop out. I feel like a failure. Why can‚Äôt I just handle things like everyone else? I need some help. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to be in college anymore but I have to if I want to get a job. I hate this. I have no friends here. I‚Äôm all alone. 
"No I don't want attention I don't want to live like this anymore. I have been alone all my life I have no friends people who I thought were my friends are not my friends they judge me and talk about about me .

Everyone talk to me for a while and they get tired and stopped talking to me and people think I am annoying. I am very quiet I don't treat people horrible. People always excluded me and I am nobody's priority. People think I am boring and I don't know what to talk about and guys always rejected me and ghosted me . 

Everything is going wrong I have no luck I can't even get a job and everyone always judging me instead of helping me . And people judge suicidal people because they think suicidal people want attention they don't understand and they have never been down that road or they don't care . No I don't want attention I want help. "
"I got a report from the dentist saying i have traces of cavities: this was a real eye opener and push to improve my hygiene in general. I had really fallen out of rhthym with brushing, so i tried to come up with something to make it more fun. 
Its only been one day, but it has really helped. I think it will work for the future too :) 
Make a playlist with songs you like around 2 mins long. Every morning and evening just play a random song off it. 
Add extra time if youre ready to include flossing/other steps, too. I hope this helps others as well!"
"I can tell the full story if anyone is interested but I don't want to go through that for no reason. It's been roughly 12 years and there's really no hope of it getting better. Any maybe-progress I make, I have a bad day or a bad dream and I spiral and ruin it. This unfortunately happens at least once a fortnight so it's always a step forward and then a step back again. I just want this to be over. If I can't feel happy or contempt at least half the time, what's the point? I'm just living for others completely but even then my struggles are starting to directly mess my life up. I've tried to make it better but this last year, I've barely been able to find the will to live, let alone the will to do anything else. I need help, I need someone to take a chance on me. Anything really but I don't think I have it in me to do this without something out of my control changing. Thanks for anything, just hoping for something I haven't thought of before I guess"
"I would love to say my toolkit solved everything and I am constantly in a happy place, but that's not how depression works in my life. My toolkit has gotten me through incredibly dark times, especially when I need a boost to get out of a very deep mental hole, and brings a lot of joy to my life when my mood is improved. I also believe in continually adding to my toolkit, so if you have any suggestions please drop them in the comments! 

Listing these in the order that deliver the most impact, so you can start with the ones up top if you're in a really bad place today:

1. Go on a run (other exercise may work too) and wear yourself out for 30 minutes. Research shows this will boost your mood for 2 hours afterwards, in my case it lasts for 3-4 hours. 

2. Don't drink alcohol. I abstained for a year and came back one glass at a time, which led me to the conclusion that 3 glasses of wine will make the voices in my head say hateful things to me all day the next day, and even 1 glass of wine will make my thoughts turn pessimistic.

3. Play video games. If you're not a gamer, download something simple on your phone. Research has shown that gaming can be better for depression that over the counter prescription medication. I believe this is because your body experiences an endorphin rush when you overcome a challenge, whether it's solving a puzzle or killing bad guys.

4. Hang out with your friends. If you're feeling too shitty to do it in person, send a text and understand that every time someone responds, they're showing you that they care and love you (even if they're not explicitly saying that). If you have a close relationship, consider telling them how you feel. It will feel good just to get your feelings in the open, but you never know, they might have good advice or be feeling exactly the same way. 

5. Be kind to strangers and coworkers. Be super nice and smile at cashiers, it will lift your heart when they smile back and is something you can carry with you all day. Compliment coworkers for the same reason, it's so fulfilling seeing someone's mood lift. If you're feeling bold, try complimenting random people on the street. 

6. Get a therapist. It's awesome having a person that you have no filter with and can say anything to. If you don't connect with the first one, try again. It can be a shitty and demoralizing search, but every now and then, a good therapist will drop an incredible insight that will blow your mind

7. Journal. I used to hate this (and sometimes still do), but it's a great method of sorting through your feelings in a way that allows you to let go of the bad ones and celebrate the good ones. 

8. Adopt a positive talk track. Don't say mean shit to yourself, pat yourself on the back when you do little positives (like buying the groceries, or washing the laundry). Also, remove the world ""should"" from your vocabulary. It's true that you can or might do something, but don't shame or guilt yourself by saying you should have done it. 



Also, happy to expand on any aspect of the toolkit. Especially if you're having trouble making friends, getting motivated to work out, etc. Just shoot me a note in the comments.

"I've been having more and more suicidal thoughts lately. I've been on five different meds and the ones I am on currently have worked the longest but now seems to be becoming useless again. I'm feeling really hopeless and I don't know what to do.
I don't have anyone I can talk to about this and as much as I want professional help it would take years to get/be very expensive and I can't afford it.

Any advice needs to be transgender friendly."

"Posted this on r/depression, only to realize it wasn't the appropriate sub for this type of discussion. Hopefully, I get it right this time. Lol.

I just recently came to the full realization that your depression can stem from a completely separate issue, and sometimes when that happens, antidepressants will not help you much. You will have to find the thing that you are struggling with the most, or else that thing will manifest into depression and make it much worse, rendering the antidepressants nearly or fully useless. For example, my depression stemmed from my ADHD, which was exacerbated by a fear of failure in life and in general. This caused anxiety and depression, but mostly depression. Whenever I had doubts about myself, forgot something, or just overall felt not very smart because of my ADHD, it caused me to be very depressed because I feared that I would never make it in life or be seen as useless. For some people, it may be very obvious, but for others, not so much. I feel like I probably should have known this earlier, but I don't know‚ÄîI guess it was one of those things that fell through the cracks. I mean, I would always notice that I would go into deep episodes whenever I failed at something academically as a result of my ADHD. However, as we all know, correlation does not mean causation, so I guess I just never put two and two together. I only recently realized that my depression manifested from my ADHD when I finally started to take stimulants. I was finally feeling happy again once I got to the right dosage. I was productive once more, active, and felt the happiest I had in the last 10 years!"
It feels like I come back to the same habits of rotting in bed and not knowing what to do. I don't even understand what's the point of doing things but I still have the fear of failure (but it's still not enough to get me out of these funks). How do you snap out of it? 
"I am alone and lonely all the time and nobody wants to hang out with me and I am always home alone while people out there having fun.

I am having a hard time finding a job and it's stressing me out either I get rejected or not hiring. When I go to interview I get ghosted.

I don't have any friends, spouse and I am not closer with my family. I am ugly, shy, boring and have social anxiety.I feel like I am going to lose my mind feel like I am going to explode feel like screaming and yelling. 

I feel like nobody cares about me people always excluded me and throw me away like trash my own family don't want to be around me a and they always talk bad about me . Being alone and lonely makes me feel worthless.

"I‚Äôm tired and bored and I don‚Äôt want to do anything anymore. I feel so empty inside. The only feeling is just a deep sadness. 

Walking, art, food, conversation, books, studying, work, cleaning, music, movies, journaling, etc‚Ä¶. They‚Äôre all just temporary. I end up more depressed afterwards when the temporary relief fades away.

"Hi. I've recently had to have the realisation that I've failed myself. I stopped going to school enough, I stopped trying. My reason was always that I was tired and depressed. But the tiredness went away and I can be happy. The problem persists. Want to skip and little to no care for it. I had my life set out infront of me ready to work towards my career. It's possible still if I pick myself up but I look inside myself to find the want or the motivation and I come back empty handed. I realised I have little to no resolve, which in my personal morals I consider to be weak willed. I always considered myself a strong person who meant well and had drive, and I find myself the opposite of who I thought I was. It's hard to recognize you're nothing like what you wanted to be, even being those people who you consider to be lackluster. I don't know how to pick myself back up. Time just seems to March on without change. I've put myself in a loop that I'm stuck in by my own doing. There's a settling feeling of finality of my disappointment in myself. I don't know what to do. I can't get up and do things. I'm well versed in depression and I don't know if that's what's happening, but I know that even in my positive period's I can't bring myself to do anything. Time is ticking and the deadline of full failure gets closer every day. If you've experienced the same, or know something about this feeling of finality/situation please leave a comment. Greatly appreciated &lt;3"
"Since the age of eight, I've struggled with severe depression, severe paranoia, severe self-harm, mild psychosis, and antisocialness, I'm 14 now. For six years I've been in a never-ending cycle of depression, nihilism, paranoia, and religious trauma. I've starved myself, denying myself from sleep for days, never bathed, never left my room, cut until my cuts had cuts, ran away, attempted suicide two times in one year, and even more.

Yet, now as I'm typing this, I'm the happiest I've ever been in a long time. Yes, I still have some issues to work out, but generally? I'm shining, I'm relaxed, I'm at peace, something last year me would've seen as foreign. I recently went to my therapist this month, and she told me that I had changed for the better. I was bubbly, talkative, energetic, and calm, a massive improvement from last year. And it's true. I *feel* better, I *look* better, and I *act* better.

People tell me that I'm the kindest person they've ever met. That I'm compassionate and sweet, and loving, and a light of joy. And I am. Truly!

And this is something I heard in a book, but kind people aren't born. They're made. They've experienced rock bottom, and know how it feels to live in an empty nihilistic, suffocating, depressive void, and they've made it their life mission to never let anyone in their lives feel the same way they had.

I'm saying all of this because it IS possible. I know most of you must be tired of hearing that, but that's because it's true. Things will get better. But it's up to you to take the first step. You have to be the one to make the trajectory in your life. You have to be the one to say, ""I will not let this break me. I can get better. Things will get better.' And eventually, they will, as long as you have that mindset, and determine yourself to be selfless, kind, loving, compassionate, and all around the best person you can be. Have hope! 

And if anyone needs or wants to talk to me, my DMs are fully open! Stay strong! Stay positive!"

"Hello, 27 year old guy here, recently got sober after a long struggle with drugs and alcohol and learning to deal with anxiety and ptsd. Broke, sad, and feeling really terrible about myself. How do I get over watching people I grew up with achieving the goals I used to work so hard to achieve myself? Example, I spent years and all the money I used to make building track cars, learning how to control them, make them and I see friends in racing leagues tearing up rally tracks meanwhile I have a suspended license because of seizures, so no car right now and I‚Äôm basically bumming a place to stay? I stay with my girlfriend whom I love to death and would like to have her be my wife eventually, I just want to cry when I look at what I have left in life. All the things I worked for are gone, my goals put on hold, I know it was all my fault I lost the things I‚Äôve had, which makes me more ashamed. I just need help, I‚Äôm nervous if I let this get to me too much I‚Äôll fall apart, I just want to find happiness doing something I enjoy meanwhile I can‚Äôt even find a job in a field I‚Äôm qualified for and love.

"I'm on meds. I feel okay but not really. Okay in a sense that I'm eating and less suicide thoughts. But I'm not motivated to do anything. I've been doing a light workout most days. Except when it rains (it rarely rains) + a few days when I feel bad. 

At this rate, I don't think I can get a job and maintain a job again. I just don't think I can do it.

Anyway, how did you do it? I know I have to apply but I don't think I can show up for work everyday.

Edit. If anyone wanna be accountability buddies, please let me know."
"In the context where someone genuinely wants to know and isn't just making small talk, but you aren't close enough to them to want to initiate a serious conversation about your depression. Primarily in text conversations but advice for being asked in person is welcome too. ""Not much, what about you?"" would be appropriate for small talk but it's not really a good response here. It sends a signal that I'm unengaged in the conversation, and it's awkward because I usually get asked it after I've already asked about what's new in the other person's life. 

I feel like the question prompts you to share something interesting you've been doing as a hobby or some development in your work. But because of the depression I've been in, I have no hobbies, relationships, or job. I genuinely couldn't tell you what I've been up to for the last two years because I basically just spend every day waiting until I can go to sleep. I'm always either trying and failing to work on my mental health or living in an empty void. I don't even watch any shows or movies or play games anymore. I have some old friends that have tried to reach out to me but I really don't know how to get past this roadblock without the conversation dying. It's hard to meaningfully catch up when I have nothing to catch them up on.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to handle this? I'm socially awkward so I wonder if I might just be missing a better way to redirect the conversation back to the other person or to some other topic. Alternatively, is there anything small but interesting and easy to lie about that I could pretend I've been doing for fun? Or do I need to just accept that the lazy not much approach is the best I can manage and hope the other person doesn't get too disinterested in talking to me? "

"Can anyone else relate?

I know I'm a pretty decent person. Underneath all of this bullshit. I like that person. I like me. But being me is a total pain in the ass. 

All this anxiety that gets in the way of me just living my life. The horrific depression that drains my vitality. All of these idiosyncrasies that aren't cute or fun but inconvenient and gross. All of them cut me off from just doing normal stuff. I just want to be able to do stuff, holy shit. 

Being me sucks, quite honestly. I don't remember the last time I was able to just have fun.  I don't remember the last time I was able to go and hang out with people without it being a massive ordeal of fighting through several layers of mental illness. And even in the moments where I have an opportunity for joy it gets pissed on by my mental illness. Depression! Anxiety! They're so part of my being and I fucking hate it. 

The inner me is so starved of connection and joy I feel like one of those desiccated aliens from the movie Cocoon.  How do I get back to where I was? How do I get back to where I was 30 years ago? That was really the last time I was able to be me. As a teenager. After that it's been 30 years of shit. Anyway thanks for listening."
"I consider myself a relatively smart person, but for about the last 2 years of my life ive been at a very low point and have no positive thoughts anymore. Ive noticed i almost sometimes feel like I have a hard time processing information or explaining information, or just feel plain stupid and unable to function, or even just useless because of this.

A lot of the time related to social things, like talking to people. I also recently found out I have high functioning autism and I wonder if that plays a role in why I am very bad at socializing, at least with new people but can this have a significant affect as well?

I also have noticed this somewhat to just things like school work, but only maybe 2 times ive had incidents where I just couldnt get my brain to even comprehend an assignment and I just end up shutting it down and get mad. This is to me partly because I just dont want to do it and I get upset.

But unless I put my all into reading and processing the text I cant understand it when usually I can casually read something and I will understand it without even needing to think twice."

"I (25F) told my friend that I had a crush on him a while ago and, as always, it wasn't reciprocated and went nowhere. Today, same friend told me about his feelings for another girl and it just kinda hit harder than it should've. This always happens; I put myself out there and nothing occurs and they go to another person. I gotta remember that someone like me doesn't deserve anything with romance and stuff like that. There's so much wrong with me for another person to come into my life and deal with me. I gotta stop being stubborn with trying to tell myself that maybe, ""this will be different.""  


But it never is and probably never will. I'm meant to be alone for the rest of my life and it is what it is."

it should be the most joyous month yet every year it gets worse. i don't know how many more decembers i can handle. 
Hope it helps ‚úå
I'm struggling. A lot. I feel inadequate and stupid. I can't breathe. I can't stop crying. I don't know how to reach out for help. Why am I so miserable? How do people love themselves? Why is it so difficult for me to do the same? Why do i live on? How do i end it?
"
I‚Äôm lonely but I also hate people, it‚Äôs like I crave human interaction, I want someone to talk to, hang out with, and share my feelings comfortably. But I'm exhausted because people either ignore, judge, use or betray me. I don't want to fall into that trap again, but the loneliness is suffocating. Isn‚Äôt it sad that most of us here are lonely but we can‚Äôt be each other‚Äôs friends? we don‚Äôt have the energy to talk, help someone or even give life another chance. 

Side note: referring to friendship "
I'll be gone soon I hope. I'm sorry everyone.
"I really need your help right now. I'm having a hard time, I'm so depressed, and I don't know what to do with my life. I'm a broke first-year nursing student, and I want to stop going to college. I want to die. I don't have the motivation to continue, but I don't want to disappoint my family. I just want to disappear and die. I've tried overdosing myself many times, but it's useless because I don't die. Please help me find a reason to stay alive in this world. I live in a toxic environment, and I've tried using my family and religion as motivation, but nothing seems to help, and I don‚Äôt care about what they say anymore. My family and friends advise me a lot about being suicidal, but it's not helping. I just want to die."
"I told my best friend about my suicidal thoughts that I've been having for months, but now I feel even more like a monster. My friend is the kindest, most supportive person I know, and they've struggled similarly in the past. I feel terrible for putting my burdens on them. I feel like a horrible monster of a person.

I feel like a liar and a fraud, because I've been having good days, despite my suicidal thoughts. I just don't know what to do anymore. My friend said they're glad I told them, but I feel like I've hurt them. I don't know what to do. I hate myself so much.

I feel like a selfish piece of shit who only hurts people"
"I have been off work this past week due to severe depression and anxiety.

I am not sure what caused it, depression progressively got worse, started missing hobbies and things I enjoy, only managing to work and no more, not looking after myself properly, over a few weeks and eventually could not manage to go to work any more.

I have been off with depression for one week and have mostly been in bed. This is the worst my mental health has been since 2021 when I was really unwell. I feel frustrated that I'm unwell again. I feel guilty for being like this.

I am working on cleaning up my room which I'm just doing a little at a time. It was like a hoarding situation and I am making progress with this for the first time in a long time. 

I'm going through a medication change which I hope will help.

I need to go for a shower. I've not had a shower for a week. My head is itchy. I smell terrible. I am embarrassed to tell anyone. I feel ashamed. I know it seems stupid like why don't I just go for a shower but I just can't face it.

I've only really been eating peanut butter sandwiches.

Is this normal for someone who is depressed? What would help? When would be a good time to go for a shower? It seems silly to go for a shower and then clean my room because I will get sweaty while cleaning? 

I want to to go back to work but I feel that I'm probably not well and should maybe take another week off. I'm really keen to be back at work. I want to be well and happy and working, not alone at home having anxiety attacks etc but I cannot help this.

This is unusual I am usually very clean and shower every day or 2.


Update: I took a shower this evening and put clean pyjamas on and feel so much better. Thanks everyone. "
"I just wanted to put this here while I drink my Tennessee adult beverage.... I know this won't get seen and that's ok with me... I'd prefer it that way... I just want to say to myself future, past, friendsand family, I'm sorry for failing you all. I have failed in the most spectacular way and I don't see a fix in sight... I live in a trailer home, work a shit overnight job that pays scraps because my disabilities keep me from doing physically demanding work... I have PTSD from my time in the military, I still have haunting nightmares to this day 14 years later... I feel as if every turn I make I fail... My last relationship ended because she cheated on me, I didn't see the signs till it was too late yet I stayed despite all of the signs. I just wish I could give up... but somehow I still have people counting on me and I don't know why... Im not a good person... I done some bad things in my life, I make bad decisions constantly... I look at myself in the mirror every day and I'm reminded of what I use to look like and I fall deeper into depression... I don't deserve happiness... I don't deserve the friendships in my life... I've gone so far as to have written up my final message for everyone to read... I want to end everything but I lack the strength to do it... Im sorry for failing not just myself but every one I know..."
"Im an Atheist, and I hate it.. Im 14 years old, I was catholic for the first 12 years of my life, but at 12 years I started doubting religion a lot, many things didn't make sense.. Wish that never happened, because after a lot of doubting, I could not have myself to believe in god. No matter what I tried, it just didn't make sense anymore, worst part is that im doing religion class, I thought it was gonna help me, but it didn't, it just make me doubt even more things..

But thats not the main point, the thing is that currently im devastated, everyday, out of nonewhere, I may be eating, duing homework, chilling, walking.. I just start thinking about death.. I think about everyone who I loved that died, that they just. Stop existing AND that will happen to me and my surroundings. I write here because I can't talk about this to anyone and just wanna let this out, because everyone around me is catholic! I feel like im gonna get excluded because of atheism. All these toughts make me extremley anxious and sometimes I tear up at night, I can't handle it! Its too much information, I feel like all im doing is 'nothing' I feel like nothing..

Does anyone feel like this? If so, how do you manage to deal with it.. :("
"Last night I made a post here in a very terrible anxiety and depression episode. I asked for you guys to tell me I'd be ok. And some of you did. I thank you for taking time to help me abd give me advice. All of your comments helped me go through the night. 

Today I was very anxious still, but I made choices and efforts to get better. And now I can say I am OK.

I know suffering from depression and anxiety is a constant battle. It will come again. And maybe I will be terrified abd desperate again. I hope we are always finding someone who is there for us to give us comfort and help us survive another day."
"Hey everyone, 

How do I stop wanting to die? I‚Äôve had a shit life. My step dad spent years molesting me, my first boyfriend ever was killed (with his sister) in a car crash after leaving my house, both of my parents have kicked me out at least once. It‚Äôs been rough. I‚Äôve always thought that I just needed to get to the better part of my life and then I would be good. I‚Äôve always had something to look forward to I guess. 

Now, I live with my fianc√© who is so sweet. We‚Äôve been together for 5 years and I‚Äôve been looking forward to getting married and being together. We finally live together and we have a wedding date in 6 months, I graduated college, I did all the things and I feel like everything should be falling into place. 

But I still feel like I want to die. I look around and the house is a mess and it‚Äôs my fault. He‚Äôs upset because he‚Äôs having to clean a lot and because I‚Äôm tired all the time and it makes me feel so bad. I can‚Äôt control my temper with him even though he is truly so so kind 99% of the time. I feel like he expects a lot from me because he knows my potential, but I am so goddamn overwhelmed by that potential and the fact that I‚Äôm never fucking living up. 

It‚Äôs also because I haven‚Äôt honestly told him I‚Äôm struggling with these thoughts again. He helped the last time I needed it, but that was like 2 years ago and I‚Äôve been so much better since then. I don‚Äôt want him to know that I‚Äôm so done. It feels worse than last time I was suicidal, it feels more final and like this is all I will ever be. 

I know all the things. I‚Äôve done fucking years of therapy. I know that my siblings need me to stay. I know I have a puppy. But it just doesn‚Äôt feel like enough this time. I don‚Äôt want to kill myself. Please help me because I can‚Äôt let other people down. I fucking hate that the only reason I have to live is to make other people happy. Fuck. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm sorry for the rant. Thank you guys I really need anything you can give rn"
"2 months ago my life was as bad as it could get, I tought about ending it, but knew that if I could get trought that phase life would get better. LIFE DOES GET BETTER. I am at an all time high right now, enjoying my friends, going to the gym, doing sports. While in rough times look to do something with a friend and eventually it will get beter. never give up on life."
"Everyone treat me horrible even on here . I am a very nice and shy I am not rude to nobody. I bathe and I keep my home clean and well dressed. 

Even my family treats me horrible. People always scream and yells at me and take me for granted and made me cry . People always say I am lazy when I am not and people say I am dirty when I am not I clean my home up and when I lived with other people and people live with me I lived in fifth and people think it's me .

I don't have friends and my family treats me like crap all the time and I am depressed most of the time because everything is going wrong and I have nobody and I have nothing but bad luck . Every since my my passed everyone treat me horrible. "

A friend from a theater thing I've been doing gave me a hug once...the first hug I've had in I don't even remember how long and it felt like the best/weirdest thing that's ever happened to me.

"I want to make it clear that i love my friend, hes amazing and so important to me.

My friend has seasonal depression, at first it wasn't so bad as i was able to keep him out of the house and out of his mind but right now it feels like we're in the deep end.

He barely hangs out with anyone and is extremely short and dry when texting and talking.
Im used to putting in more effort in most my friendships, ive always been the first to text or ask to hang out which was fine by me because we always had fun. Now it feels like im putting in 90% of the effort, he gives empty excuses to not hanging out and it makes me feel like shit for trying, im worried that im just pushing him away more.

Idk what to do, or how to help. I just keep trying to remember that its even harder for him and pray fall comes"

But recently I feel fine, just exhausted even tho I barely do anything, just came back from the grocery store and feel like I've worked an 8 hour shift. I've been slacking off on exercise for the past 2 weeks so maybe it's the lack of activity that made it worse. 

My body just feels so heavy like I can barely get up from bed."

"I had a good weekend, I only felt a wave of depression on Friday for a little bit, but yesterday and today I haven't really felt it. 

My goal was to not have to take a nap but I was so exhausted. I am proud of myself though because instead of making myself continue to fall asleep I got up to face the day and actually pulled a lot of weeds  :) . I got some much needed sunshine and I feel accomplished. 

Another good thing,  this might sound silly, but im actually watching a show, I haven't had pleasure or interest in very much lately, so I hope this is the beginning of coming out of it.

I have an appointment on Tuesday, and I'm going to tall to my Dr about some cognitive behavior therapy, and see if I can start seeing a therapist. 

I don't know what the rest of the week will look like, I'm hoping and praying this is the end of my depression and my higher dosage of medicine is kicking in. 

I just wanted to share because I am so proud of myself and so happy."

"I turned 29 recently, and it hit me what a loser and a failure I am in life. I can't even maintain friendships; I never had a girlfriend.

"**I am so desperate for a friend, I can't take it.**

(this was cross-posted to other advice subreddits, so apologies if you see it twice!!)

As a chronically-overstimulated introverted Millennial with ADHD, I obviously found immense solace in the internet growing up. I used to connect with people online all the time through omegle (text only lol), facebook groups, online gaming, etc. So I was chronically online, but it it gave way to lots of organic friendships. Some of my best friends growing up and as a young adult were people I met online.

These days, I do not play online games (no time) or have social media beyond reddit. I have real life friends, and they are lovely people, but I just feel too low to connect with them, because I am just so ashamed of myself.

**\[Don't read the below unless you want to read a monolog borne from the depression spiral I started while writing this...\]**

~~I am ashamed because I am depressed, sick, and recently had to go on disability because I stopped being able to do my job :(~~

~~I used to have a fiance who made me feel so special. He was my best friend, and I clearly derived too much self-worth from his love. He's still my partner, but he changed. He saw my illness flare up, and he responded to my requests (begging) for help/support with annoyance, resentment, and more isolation. I do so much for him, for his son, for our lives, and he makes me feel so little and unimportant. I don't even know if he is my friend anymore. He changed :( This also makes me feel so ashamed :(~~

~~I have friends, and they are worried about me and want to help, but I don't know how to let them. Deep in my soul, I do not feel like I am worthy of bothering any of them. I also worry about the rejection. Who will take me as I am? I am sick, afraid, depressed, and all of this makes me even more messy, disorganized, and flighty. My own partner doesn't even want to have a conversation with me. I'm so sad all the time, it makes me self-focused. That's not a good friend. They are all struggling with their own really-hard things, and I'm just useless to them :( I'm useless to everybody.~~

I'm so lonely.

**I am desperate to feel like someone actually** ***wants*** **to talk to me,** ***despite*** **my being so sick, at my absolute lowest. I don't want to feel like I have to explain why I let it get so bad. I just want to have a conversation that isn't weighed down by** ***me***. :(

So maybe an internet friend could help?

I feel like making a new friend with the low-pressure stakes of the internet (*where I can sit in my bed, cry without disrupting the conversation, bathe when my body hurts, etc.*) might help me snap out of this and take back control of myself and of my life. Right now, I'm just sitting here... I'm so tired of netflix and napping, but I'm too sick to do anything ""real.""

**Does anyone know where people meet other non-pervert human beings online?**

These days, I often pretend to be a man just to avoid the barrage of misogyny that is so common in online spaces like reddit now. I don't want to pretend to be a man, because I can't honestly connect with people when I have to carefully moderate my sentences to ensure that I don't accidentally let it slip that I have female experiences (which are 100% of my experiences because I'm female).

Are there **woman-safe spaces online** (that aren't fandom or require me to learn video games with a learning curve in order to participate)?

Thank you all &lt;3"

"I hate it because no matter how many people I know say they love and care about me, I‚Äôm always the last thing on their minds at Christmas. Also my birthday. And Mother‚Äôs Day. But god forbid I forget about them.

"I'm already in treatment for my depression, but lately I've just wanted to be by myself or with my husband only. I have one good friend, and the problem isn't with her, but I have no desire to get together. I've already blown off several plans, but agreed to hang out tonight. Honestly, I'm kinda dreading it. How do you get through plans with friends you've already made? I honestly feel really guilty for feeling this way, which certainly doesn't help depression either."

"I feel like I am drowning and there is no end. I have been fighting a battle that feels like I can't win. I would turn to friends to talk but they have left this world. I know my wife and son love me. It just feels like no matter what I do everything collapses around me. I need help and I am trying to get it I just don't know how much more I can take. My wife suggested taking gummies to calm my anxiety, but I have not used any substances since 1997. 


Any advice would help greatly. "
"I‚Äôm just so fucking done. I lost my son and I can‚Äôt continue on anymore. He was a late miscarriage and my first. His father doesn‚Äôt want to try for another one but him and I have a really good bond.

I‚Äôm autistic and it‚Äôs hard for me to have a connection with people like I do with him. It has taken 30 years for me to find him and I don‚Äôt have another 30 years left in me to find someone else. I‚Äôm forced to choose between sacrificing my desire for a rainbow baby to be with him or being unfulfilled and unhappy without a child. I don‚Äôt want to make that choice. I ONLY want it to be HIS AND MY child together. I can‚Äôt keep this up anymore and I don‚Äôt want to make that choice. I just want to be with my son since he‚Äôs sending me all sorts of signs and messages.

"I keep hearing all these stories about people's significant other who is struggling with depression and they want to help them. And I always wonder to myself, ""man, I wish I had a partner like that""

I know the saying that ""comparison is the thief of joy"" but still... Idk...

I guess I want to know what type of person is willing to get in to a relationship with a person who is crippling from depression. Could it be other people who also have depression?"
"Does anyone else struggle with extreme brain fog when depressed? Or even a little after depressive episodes? Recently, it's been so hard to even think clearly or even properly communicate. Especially with writing.  I used to be so good at writing, but now even the most basic shit takes so much effort and is sub-par. It just takes so much energy and effort.  Just writing this post has taken me thirty minutes.

"I turned 20 in March. My dad died about 6 months ago. My mother is living her new life with a new man (she left my father while he was still alive, so you can deduce why my dad is no longer alive today), and now I am living with my uncle, the brother of my father. I live with him, his wife, and my 2 cousins. It has already been 6 months; time goes fast. The last message from my father via Messenger is from February 10th. It hurts so much. I don't know, I just keep going forward, but there is not one fucking single day where I don't want to end it all. I just have this feeling of sadness, emptiness, loneliness in me. Whatever I do, whatever I try, it persists. The fact that I can no longer see, have time with, laugh, or talk to my best friend enrages me so much and makes me so sad. The fact that when it happened that night, my mom still decided to keep living with her new man instead of living alone with her own son when I needed her the most, and I didn't want to endure sharing a living space with her new man, especially when this happened. And I'm even 100% sure she cheated on him, and she is not even able to admit it. I am no longer able to believe her like I used to trust my mother in the good old times. So, I texted her to talk to me again when she is ready to admit the entire truth, and after that, we may be able to look forward and rebuild a solid base of trust between us. But it has now been 1 month since that message, and she hasn't answered yet. I miss her, I love her, but my values come first, especially for my father. If not, if I just fake it and continue to see her, it feels fake. I cannot do normal daily activities with her without that thought in the back of my mind because, for her, with her new man, it's a new story, a new life. She would just want me to stop and just accept her new man and keep moving forward, but there is no fucking way it feels right in my head. And if I fake it, then it's me that will get hurt. I don't know what to do anymore. I talked with a psychologist, talked to my family; it doesn't help (for me). It helps to contain it, but I think it is just a matter of time before something dark will happen. I have a lot of scenarios on how. In September, I start pursuing my lifelong dream of going to a school for programming, but even that, in fact, nothing else in this world was worth more than my father and my mother. This normal life I was living with my favorite humans is now fucking gone, and I just want to destroy everything."

"I have had a problem with suicidal thoughts off and on over the last few years. After a few months virtually devoid of them, they started coming back with a vengence a few weeks ago. Typically they are not that common when I'm at home, but when I go to work or do anything moderately stressful/unpleasant it's like all I can think about sometimes. As you can imagine, this is very exhausting and disheartening especially since I've been relatively happy lately otherwise. How do you cope when these thoughts come up, aside from setting up a safety plan?"

I am ALWAYS obsessing over how I look, and how much better others look than me. I always obsess over my hair and I feel like it looks bad.

"I‚Äôm currently doing some required classes for college that start at 6:50am and end anywhere from 4:00pm to 6:30pm and are highly labor intensive. Like, we are not only out in the woods all day, but we‚Äôre given a large amount of physical labor to complete and a significant amount of math to do as well. We are walking miles through briars and hills and creeks and at the end of the day I am so exhausted I can‚Äôt function.

 I‚Äôm so mentally and physically tired I can‚Äôt cook or clean or do laundry or go out and hang out with my friends. My living conditions weren‚Äôt great since I was already struggling with these things, but they‚Äôre getting worse. Combine that with a lack of clean clothes, food other than microwave meals, isolation and lack of energy to even be interested in anything, I am not doing so well.

I am strongly tempted to ask my friends or my partner for help this weekend since social facilitation works really well as a motivator for me, but they are also very busy and very depressed as well. I feel like it would be unfair to ask someone to give up part of their breath of fresh air that is the weekend just to sit with me while I do chores. 

Would inviting someone to sit with me be reasonable or irrational? What can I do to manage these things in a day to day manner or not involving other people? When I walk into my room I become overwhelmed and just go lay down for several hours, is there something I should prioritize or a way to break the visage of a messy room down into smaller and easier to deal with things?

I'm 22 so I don't have much to put on a resume besides 2 mediocre years of college that I dropped out from and bullshit jobs I worked for less than half a year at a time. I'm feeling terrible about my prospects of finding decent work. I'm out of money and I can't get my life started.

"I'm on meds. That got me to stop thinking about suicide but I'm struggling with motivation. 

So I was just looking for a show to watch but lost interest on anything. I always keep something playing so my thoughts won't run wild. I didn't even intentionally think about it but it just entered my mind because I wasn't watching or listening to anything. 

What's odd about this. This is the first time the thought of cutting my wrists came into mind. When I've thought about suicide in the past, it would be through different ways. But now the image of bloody wrists keep popping up in my mind. 

I don't even know what I want out of this post. I guess I just wanted to share. Is sharing this a bad thing? Since it may trigger someone else. What do you think?"

"i want to live

I have been sensitive and shy all my life. Only a couple of years ago, I made a lot of effort to change and become confident. For the first time in all my years, I even gained pride. I felt really great. For the first time, I began to feel the taste of freedom and something similar to happiness. 
In 2020, I moved from my hometown with my mom and younger brother. I have always loved my mom and the rest of my family very much, and I have been very desperate with my unconditional love for her specifically. In 2020, I was diagnosed with anxiety depressive disorder with adjustment problems for the first time. At the very beginning, my mother supported me, although I never thought that she would be, she always avoided the topic of psychology and rather believed that those who go to psychiatrists are psychos. But she accepted me, even with such convictions of hers. 
Until 2023, everything was fine. From time to time I got better and then worse and I took antidepressants with a doctor's prescription. 
A year ago, my life turned into a real hell and now I'm on the verge of finishing my life.
I haven't told anyone about it, and I'm very worried about it now, so I'll tell you more briefly."

"I had depression myself, and some days ago he burst into tears in my arms, telling me about what's going on with his life.

A lot of bells rang to me: he said all the typical sentences of a depressed person.
""I can't do this anymore""
""I'm doing what I love, but I'm never happy""
""The things that I used to love, now make me feel nothing""
""I'm always so tired""
""I can't do this anymore, I can't do this anymore, I can't do this anymore""...

Also, through one of our common friends, I discovered he has some suicidal thoughts.

He's already going to a therapist. But I feel he's not realizing all of this stuff. He suppreses his emotion pretty often. He let his guard down with me, because he was really tired that day.

What do you suggest I can tell him, to let him know that I think he might have all the signs of a depressed person, without scaring him? I'm afraid he would reject all of this information, and that he will isolate himself.

His parents aren't helpful, and he has issues with his current partner (which has a mental disorder themselves). But he has a solid friend group, with also me in it. We all love him and support him and are here for him.

Thanks for the help in advance!
Stay healthy. Virtual hug ‚ô°"

I think half the time, I have general idea that I need to change but I still keep doing repetitive things almost feels like I'm doing self harm. I just can't find a way to change and there isn't any desire to it. I spend so much time being home doing nothing. Not finished college. Not gotten a job just worked few jobs here and there but as adult never made any real significant income. As adult it's important to get your life toghter and contribute financially. I still keep living in fear. Have not achieved my goals that I set few years ago. Now everything feels irrelevant because me not doing anything for years makes me feel like I'm not good use. Eventually people will start pointing fingers at me or talk behind my back like look at this guy. A best example of failure. I'm tired of it. I keep telling myself I want to change and better myself but I'm not sure what's stopping me. "

"One day, when I wasn't suicidal but I was feeling pretty down, I created a suicide safety plan, and tonight it saved my life.

I was in such deep despair that I didn't know what to do and truthfully didn't want to do anything except for disappearing completely forever...

What's on the plan?

1. 6 very basic activities that help me feel better (stuff like making my favourite tea and watching comedy, or putting on a positive affirmations track and laying in bed under a soft blanket, mostly things that feel good to one or 2 of my 5 senses)
2. Things to look forward to (can be as simple as looking forward to ice cream in the summer or watching a beautiful sunset or as complex as travel and career plans)
3. List of basic things I am grateful for (food on my table, clean running water, a supportive teacher I had, etc)
4. Letter from my adult self to my younger self/inner child
5. Letter I found online by a person who experiences these types of thoughts
6. Some people also add possible people to contact (distress line, relative, friends, etc.), but that's sadly not an option for me

Other than that, I have a private YouTube list of encouraging messages and tips from people who have had similar thoughts/experiences in the past!

What would you put on your plan? I highly recommend having a plan in place just in case, even if it's basic."

I've cross posted this in a few different subs but I'm just really looking for advice and tips. I've struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a child and it's truly getting too much to handle as time goes on. It's a harsh reality check that this is likely something I will live with for the rest of my life.
"No one understands mental ilness stuff in my environments. I do have to show up to school but i am stuck of thinking about my explanation. I did tell my english teacher i have depression months ago but my parents said i am just lazy. 19years old btw(undergrad). And i do have other mental illness struggles like anxiety, selfharm, agoraphobia, MDD and BodyDysmorphia. But my parents never really cared or believed me that i am mentally sick. They tell me i am not a crazy person therefore cant let me go to a psychologist or any kind of it. 

Whenever i mention the school counselors EVERY YEAR(i changed schools like 4 times) that i have depression they usually dont know what it means(i dont blame them most people are religious and they believe the people who gives up on themselves are selfish and go to hell so we dont even have a suicide hotline and i am sure i would call them every week if we had a line..) or why cant i basically wash up every 3 days and come to school just like every kid? They will never understand that the reason i am at my bed for 12 hours everyday isnt because i enjoy sleeping. It feels like torture to try your best and no one fking sees it. 

My agoraphobia definitely is created by my depression over the years. I stayed at home more than half my life for sure and depression made me appreciate every little thing in life brings happiness: birds chipping, smell after rain, whenever kids tell their jokes to you, whenever someone you dont even know is kind to you..i could write a whole book about these and how beautiful it felt even when i was the most miserable, but now its different, i cant see life the same its like my depression evolved into agoraphobia(afraid of going outside basically) and i am only filled with fear and regret. It seems like i am coming to an end but i have to stay alive cuz i dont want my parents to think i deserved to go to hell or anything, i just need to hear someone tell me they understand me, i just wished that someone would see that i am trying my best, i am not a lazy teen :( i swear."

I am terribly touched starved but also touch adverse and it‚Äôs making my depression hit hard. I‚Äôm trying to keep getting up everyday but I just feel cold and alone. I miss having a significant other but I‚Äôm not in a good place for getting involved in a relationship. So I‚Äôm laying in bed wishing that the upvotes were hugs from a loved one rather than digital currency. üò≠
just don't feel safe with my self at all and i almost offed my self a few days ago only thing stopping me was my cat how can i tell him without stressing him out or seeming selfish and just idk weird. and for anyone saying i don't wanna go there i genuinely don't think l'Il be alive in a few days if i'm here in this house i have been there before not the best but it stopped me so that's what counts . forgot to add it's been like 3 almost 4 years since i was sent to the hospital and it was threw a therapist and i still wasn't that open about it

52 m here depressed many years nothing has worked and I am beginning to think my depression will never go away and I will always be like this.
"I‚Äôve had high functioning depression and anxiety for many many years. Since 2022, it turned more into deeper state of sadness and hopelessness, i was offered to take SSRI last fall, but declined. Now i want to tell everyone how i motivated myself to change.

I‚Äôm ambitious and i want to achieve great things in life, but my mental health has been blocking me a lot. Daily brain fog, tiredness, apathy, sadness, stress, low confidence.
I had so much excuses for myself, but the one i always used was ‚Äùi‚Äôm depressed‚Äù.

Last week i got tired of always seeking comfort from old ‚Äùsafe‚Äù patterns (staying home doing nothing, because ‚Äùi just can‚Äôt change things‚Äù). I still had some motivation to change myself, so just fucki*g started! 
Sounds stupid and easy i know, but really, you have everything you need for change. Your mind!

So, How did i do it?

I started to read a book called ‚ÄùReinvent Yourself‚Äù. Extremely motivating book with helpful tips and facts, that are scientifically proven.
For example, i used to be more social and extroverted as a kid, but my old state made me turn into myself, often just simply to avoid things. Now i‚Äôve started to connect more with my friends, and i‚Äôve got back to dating.

I started to take St. Johns Wort 2 times a day (started 2weeks ago), and the result are HUGE! I feel much more optimistic, lighter, 
motivated, and just‚Ä¶ happier! Strong
recommendation! I take D vitamin in the morning, and B+Magnesium in the evening. I more drink water, eat healthier and avoid eating TOO much junk food.

Also since i had high functioning depression, i was somehow able to exericse normally, but it didn‚Äôt make me feel better. Now i‚Äôve been much more active. I enjoy working out, and i switch between sports to stay entertained!

But the most important thing for me, was that i‚Äôve started to re-create myself. 
I‚Äôve made list of things that are possible for me to change, list of things i no longer enjoy, list of things i wish would be different.
I have strong will power, but i also have lot of self doubts. 
If you are unhappy with yourself, change yourself.

I‚Äôm young, very good looking guy, with dreams and ambition. I know i can live my dream life, but i have to get my ass up and put myself to change my perspective of my life. 
I wish good to everyone, and if someone needs more information or motivation, please DM i want to help people. (I think it‚Äôs easier for me to help younger people, since they are closer to my situation).

We got this guys! Love!"
"Just that really. What do you do when every day, you just wake up and numb your way through the day until you can go back to sleep? I'm on meds, have been for years. I would never do anything to not exist, I have kids and would never cause them pain. 

Do you guys think it's possible to have experienced that much crap that there is just no coming back from it? Sometimes I think that's the case with me. Like the very core of my being died some time ago and now I'm like a zombie, alive in body but not in spirit. 

It's like just total disillusionment I guess. The good things about life just don't outweigh the shittiness of it. 

I don't really want to go into some big lament about everything that's happened and gone wrong in my life. Just needed to write this out on here I guess, with cyber folk that get it."
"I feel like the only recovery stories I've read are from people who developed depression in adulthood or who had it for around 5 years or less. That's not to diminish the value of those stories, the seriousness of their problems, or the significance of their recoveries. But I've had severe depression (and anxiety) since I was a young child, nearly for two decades now, and I just can't see myself in them. I've tried and am trying just about everything, including meds and therapy. Some things have helped, but never enough to make me functional or to allow me to go a day without being miserable. I've heard it said that you can't cure depression after having it for 10+ years, and while I know there is no ""cure"", I'm really losing hope that any meaningful recovery is possible for me. I don't just want to feel a tiny bit better; I want to feel okay.

Has anyone here personally been through this and come out the other side? I'd really appreciate hearing about your journey. Or even if you have just seen a story like this elsewhere online and can share it."

"I don‚Äôt normally talk to people about my life or anything. But I felt today was particularly difficult being Christmas. I had a falling out with my family a few years ago, and I took a plane to the other side of the country, becoming homeless and figuring out adulthood alone. We‚Äôve since reconnected but it‚Äôs been hard reaching ‚Äúnormal‚Äù communication and conversations. They were disappointed I didn‚Äôt fly out to them for the holidays but I couldn‚Äôt afford to. I‚Äôve been depressed since I was a kid dealing with abusive alcoholic parents and being a functioning 24 year old now, I feel like I‚Äôm half a person most days. I don‚Äôt know how to talk to people or trust people. I tend to fall into depression pits where I can‚Äôt even clean my apartment. Today I wanted to cook some food for Christmas but every thing in my sink was from over a month ago, and the sight and smell of disgusting dishes and mold sent me into a panic attack and I started screaming. I cried until I worked up enough strength to go back and clean my kitchen to cook food. Days like this make me wonder how I‚Äôve been depressed for so long, and why I can‚Äôt pull myself out of it. I don‚Äôt know how to talk about it either. I just push through to the next day and tell myself to try getting through this day, and then the next, and then the next again"
"So I see people with depression. Their trauma their abuse etc. 

For me, I had a happy childhood. I was a hero in school. I got in college and I did pretty well. Few hick ups here and there but overall good. 

Then I got a decent and respectable job. 

Why the fuck am I depressed ? It feels like I am an imposter. And it makes me more sad."
"What's the point of doing all this? Medication after medication, clean room, clean body, full belly....and I still feel like I wanna die. I think I look pretty, and I still wanna bang my head against the wall. I have a loving and kind boyfriend, I would still shoot myself in the head. Why do I still feel like this? What's the point of getting better if I'm still....feeling like this? What's the point of trying to get better if I'm still here on the brink of tears? What's the point of....any of this? I know how pathetic this is. I have it so well now, even if I didn't before, I do now. So I should be happy. But I'm not. If I ever pay attention to how I'm feeling, it's always the current emotion layered on this horrible twisting pain. I can never feel happy. I changed the way i think, I changed who I'm around, I've done all the right things and I'm still sitting here. Just. Depressed. Empty. Soulless. I can't explain how much I've been trying for so long. What's the point if I'm STILL feeling like this? The only thing I'm good at is trying not to kill myself."
"Does it?Do i have to go  to the bed all numb and depressed ever fucking night,with all the memories on the replay of how much happier i could've been?i been genuinely wondering can you ever cure depression, cuz there will be happines in my life for like.a few days,and few weeks at the time and suddenly this overwhelming feeling of chrusing depression sets in,and i start to overthink,i cant express emotions like a normal human being anymore,i cannot cry anymore,why couldn't my life be perfect like my friends lifes are,why am i fucking ugly?Ive been trying to be nothing but possitive these past couple of weeks but i think i am finally cracking,j dont know if i am going to be alive anymore,if i dont post on reddit anymore,ive have either killed myself or found genuine happines."
"My sister recently began her first year of high school and over time, she began sleeping more and more, longer and longer and has been skipping school every day now. She sleeps until 4-6 pm, gets up for a bit then returns to bed. She quit her sports because of school, too. I hate to see her like this and I want to be able to support her, especially because I have been in the exact same position before and know how she feels. I try to invite her out to grab boba (which is her favorite) but her anxiety gets the best of her and now she won‚Äôt go at all. 

It‚Äôs hard to watch things get worse, and although my family has brought in professional help it hasn‚Äôt been helping. I know that a dangerous mindset is so easy to slip into and it feels as if you can‚Äôt be pulled out, it‚Äôs just permanent. I‚Äôm worried that she‚Äôs going to be in danger soon, and I can‚Äôt lose her. I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything, how can I help her?"
"Good day you freakin‚Äô ray of sunshine. You went beastmode yesterday, you‚Äôre in beastmode today and you will be a beast tomorrow!

Use this chance to be around people that makes you feel something, and do things that makes you feel alive! And if you want to stay in bed all day, you do that!

This post is probably going to end up at the back of the reddit algorithm but fuck it. I've been suffering from psychosis and depression since I was 14 my first suicide attempt was at 15 last year I spent a lot of time in the hospital and psych ward after yet another suicide attempt. Everyone has been telling its going to get better but so far it hasn't gotten any better I'm still sick I'm still trying to drown my demons in frivolous habits and addictions. I dont have the energy to fight this anymore I want to feel okay again. 
"Just over the high rent, the toxic people, it's  the daily hope to do better and get better . I am born and raised here and I have never seen this city this bad.

There's times I want to give up but the only thing that keeps me a float is my teenage son who's my üòá i couldn't bare to think of leaving him alone on this earth especially not now and not ever.

i recently just finished a 700ml of 3.4% alcholol all by myself over 3 days at 13 nearly 14 now. am i going to be fine or not. or am i just slipping further into my depression and hatred for myself. i told myself when i was younger why do people drink alcholol and now i fear that im gonna become one of those alcholoics . is my life over? 
"Life isn‚Äôt easy for anyone, but it shouldn‚Äôt be awful. I was bullied because of my race, ADHD, anxiety, and bipolar 2 symptoms I couldn‚Äôt control or understand. Then my parents passed away and depression hit hard. I was an emotional kid, often told I was ‚Äòtoo sensitive‚Äô or ‚Äòoverreacting,‚Äô which led me to suppress my feelings and isolate myself for long periods of time.

2 years ago, while struggling with my the anniversary of my mother, a 26-year-old streamer I met on a friend forum groomed and threatened me at 18 with assault and kidnapping. He catfished me with photos of himself from 19 and made false promises while disregarding my grief. I blocked him and tried to contact his workplace, but was told nothing could be done and was given the wrong number. Authorities weren‚Äôt contacted due to fear.

Someone I talked with started acting strangely, and a mutual copied my entire online bio word-for-word. Then, more drama followed. I distanced myself from everyone involved to focus on healing, ending toxic friendships, and blocking negativity. Overwhelmed, I relapsed from being unable to grieve properly which broke my heart.

This was in 2022‚Ä¶ Since then, I‚Äôve isolated myself. Only going out with family or close friends but avoiding my town due to anxiety about seeing people from my past. Am I wrong for still feeling upset at triggers, even after two years? Am I wrong for speaking out about my emotions and calling out what was wrong?

As of 2024, I‚Äôm doing better with setting boundaries, communication, blocking negativity, and seeing right from wrong. I‚Äôm in a wonderful relationship, have great friends, and a support system. I create posters and gaming content also learning to make instrumentals. I‚Äôm working towards a career in animal science but my chronic illness is physically debilitating. I‚Äôll be confident enough to fully live life someday.. ‚ô°

My replies got removed but thank you for your advice Val. Avoiding others from my past is hard for me still. It sounds like I‚Äôm doing good but im not especially since it‚Äôs that time of grief for me and the memories come back. Mal, Every day is a battle not to fall back into old patterns. I wish I‚Äôd known that sooner instead of letting people walk over me. Im happy for you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I've heard that some people are able to ""shut down their brain""  to avoid feeling like shit. In my opinion this sounds pretty functional way to deal with suffering that is caused by external factors that are unchangeable. How do people achieve this state?"
"My best friend killed herself and I really don't know what to do.
Her death broke me, in the start I have starting to have sex a lot until once I had a panic attack and started to cry, since than j didn't do it again, then I started to smoke nicotine a lot untill it made me feel worse, now I started to drink.
I am seeking help, and it worked for a while but I don't think it's enough anymore. I started drinking and self harming not a while ago, I really don't know why I do it, but I feel like it's the only thing that makes me let go of everything, and relief all the emotions I have in me and so people would notice and offer help.
It's really hard for me to ask for help, and I think drinking really makes it easier for me.
A couple days ago I drunk too much again, and  my mother found me in this state and I starting to have an episode.
She told me that if I won't stop with this she will have to hospitalize me. Idk if i should, Maybe it will help me but i have never been there before so I'm scared.

Sometimes i have triggers of the night she killed herself, and the search for her.

I had a lot of guilt, I felt I could tell her Something that would make her stay, but after a lot of sessions with my psychologist It had helped me a lot with the guilt.

I felt like sharing here whould make me feel a little better.
Thank you for reading

"I hear this a lot from people who claim to support mentally ill people. And yesterday I heard a spiritual teacher say some people do this. I am disturbed and feel like it's a very dangerous thing to assume. 

What does this even mean? Unless you are not really mentally ill but have a disorder of sorts... 

One thing I have seen overlapping in most mental illnesses is paralysis. Who would consciously choose to just rot in bed rather than go outside? 

If you've encountered such a thing I would really like to know cause when paralysis from any mental illness and general depression hits, in as much as you can't find motivation to move you are painfully aware of people's attitude towards you (I know a lot of it is just your mind and probably even isn't true).

"My best friend is depressed and tried to take her own life. I know I wont be able to help her properly but she is seeking professional help.

"Everything seems so pointless and I (23 M) am at a breaking moment in my pathetic existence. I am jobless, have never been in a relationship, and I feel as if this is the end. Why carry on living in a world where you work, fuck, and then die. We were never built for this. It's all a fucking lie. What's even worse are the ones who perpetuate this garbage when they know how stupid it all is. Ignorance is a bitch and a killer and I wish I had it. It would be better for me to have my head in the clouds than to be the critical, depressed sack of shit I am."
To those who have fought depression how did you do it? How did you deal with the triggers?  I am in a cycle that is wasting my life away. I just want to get better please help. SOS.

"I can't take it anymore, each day I see all this propaganda, all this people, that seem normal, but their hands are all covered in blood, my hands are covered in blood, blood of all the Ukrainian people, affected by war, and I can't stop it, I hardly have enough money to help myself, let alone someone else, I try my best to keep myself together, but I can't, I just want to die, to end all this nightmare, I know some people will get sad, but I really don't see anything positive happening to me, my dream come true would be green card for me and my boyfriend, but it's something very unlikely to happen. It's much easier just to kill myself."
"I know it‚Äôs a weird question but I‚Äôm not sure how else to phrase it. 

I‚Äôm (20f) starting to realize how much my depression has affected my personality. I grew up pretty sheltered and very happy. Like waiting for my life to start but happy to just keep going through the motions until it did. Not happy in middle school? Maybe high school will be fun. Not happy in high school? Maybe college will be fun. I‚Äôm not sure why I was like that. Just keep looking forward, any social interaction could possibly be the meeting of a future friend! But‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even imagine being like that now. 

That being said, I was still had ‚Äúfriends‚Äù or acquaintances. But once I got to art school (college) I had about a month of a real social life and it was the happiest I ever was. But then I was beaten down and double crossed by nearly every friend I made there. I was alone and paranoid, which led to me to isolate myself in my dorm room and deal with major depression for the first time in my life. Everything I thought about life was a lie and I couldn‚Äôt see a light at the end of the road anymore. 

That‚Äôs about it for context. With time, I guess I learned I have to be okay with being alone. So that‚Äôs what I did. I‚Äôm finally on my last year, ready to graduate and get the hell out of that school. But I just don‚Äôt feel free. I should still hold out hope for friends but now just thinking about trying again fills me with dread and a natural avoidance. I used to be able to be charismatic and socialize so easily before I fell into depression. Now (as I recently realized since I went out with my only friend yesterday) I can‚Äôt even express myself with THEM. It was so awkward (but we‚Äôre both awkward people honestly lol) The ONE person I look forward to seeing and hanging out with. I‚Äôm dry, shut down, I don‚Äôt have the energy to carry a conversation anymore. I‚Äôm praying my friend understands since they knew me for years even before I changed. 

But the main issue is I‚Äôve completely lost who I was. How can I go back? To be normal and happy again, enough where I can function in social settings again? 

(I know that I should go the therapy trust me, I just have terrible executive disfunction and I just don‚Äôt want another thing on my plate. If anything I‚Äôm looking for maybe someone who‚Äôs been through something similar?)"

"Why do I miss being extremely depressed and suicidal?
Allow me to say, I was never open about being depressed.

"I don't really have anyone to talk to, so... I don't know I just want to say my story.

My parent, they aren't abusive. But I would say they have some problem. 

My mom always over-protecting me. If I do something wrong or something happens to me, she will act like something catastrophe happens. To be honest, I always afraid of her. I worry if I did something and it will make my mom sad. I think a lot before I tell her anything about me, no matter good news or bad news. Therefore, I never have an actual mother&amp;daughter communication, nor any emotional support. (It feels like I am the one who support her emotion.)

My father, he cares a lot about his reputation. Most of the time he just makes up something or gives me fake promise just because he wants to be looks like a good father or something. I don't think he actual say something true to me, if it is something that about his reputation.

I have a younger brother, he bullies me. Slamming the door, scolding for me for no reason, singing as loud as he can at 2 am everyday. He knows I have depression, so he does a lot of things to makes my depression worse intentionally. Like scolding me for going to see doctor, saying I should apologies for seeing doctor, claimming that I don't consider his feeling for requesting him to volume down for his ""2 am singing section."" Look, I tried everything to being nice to him. But he just keeps using the ""you are not considering my feeling"" just to make my depression more serious. For example, If I asking him ""Hey, I am going to order Uber Eats, would you like to have some?"", he will slam his table and scold""I am not hungry, why you order Uber this early. Have you ever consider me?""

My parent just ask me to torlate and consider him more just because I am the older one, and do nothing about it. He definitly the spoiled child, but he claims I am the one. I don't know man, you are just being turn down by the person you have crush on, then mom and dad takes you to the fxxking expensive clinic. (BTW, he diagnose nothing, by two doctors.) Me? I don't even get any treatment, and being blamed that ""You are depressed just because you eat too less."" ""Why you make yourself this sad? Have you ever considering our feelings?""

Now, I already moved out. I can't say that I live a happy life, as my medication just keep increasing and increasing. It seems that it doesn't have an end. It is hard to live on my own, but I don't have any support, economically or emotionally. I started to think, why I am still alive. I don't anything want to do. I dream a lot about ending myself, and I don't even have a single thing to regret. 

I should take a shot don't I?"

"Dad just eh. I can't imagine talking to this guy about anything. I have no family support system, my friend's are the best tho. What huts the most is sister's remark. Not to me, but about her coworker. She mocked her that she's burnt out at age of 22 or smth, which really put me off. I had burnout progressively creep in since I started working at age 16, am a people pleaser and workaholic. My mental stability was supported by my coworkers telling me thank you after every shift. But I couldn't pay my college with thank you, so I left, where I was used and overworked, never paid in the end. Then war started, I was scared to step a foot in the kitchen. I returned to my first place of work, by mere coincidence. The situation with money was better, but not perfect. The boss was still shit. Eventually shit started to go downhill, I started to do more mistakes, i was the least paid out of other co-workers (except cleaners) and I was planning to work to help and live with my bf in future. So I left. It was a breathe of fresh air, or would be if mom wouldn't press me about when will I start searching for a job. 6 months later, I'm going in and out of bad, and I mean BAD depressive episodes, my rejection sensitivity is so strong I can't even think of searching, I'm constantly self sabotaging, you name it. I can't get out of the house to go hang out with friends, when it's usually easy, suicidal ideations, I can barely enjoy anything anymore, it's the worst I was ever been. The worst thing is I'm always pro therapy and meds, but I feel so hopeless of the future I don't believeeds will help me, I'm just fundamentally feel broken and disabled. I have no career goal again, and even if I had I'm too much of a pussy to try new things without 100% chance of success. What's the point of pouring money and time in uni(I never went) if I don't know if I'll burn out again and learn to hate the new job. And it will be a cycle of misery, for loving what you do, striving to be at least good, never reaching the good enough and giving up because you're so exhausted. I'd like to get diagnosed with ADHD, but it doesn't matter, cuz Adderall isn't legal in here. I just want to rot in bed and for everything to stop."

"As the title says , I can't tell if I'm depressed or just lazy. I feel really really tired all the time throughout the day even if I don't do anything at all. I feel highly demotivated, things I once enjoyed doing (playing games, watching movies etc...) feels like a chore now. My personal hygiene has also declined significantly through the past year.
              
I'm physically not able to complete important tasks like doing laundry and doing college work....
Like I putt off assignments and lab work till the last fkn minute even though I know that I won't be able to complete it in time, like....I literally have four assignments to submit tomorrow and I haven't even started it yet....idk what to do.
      
  I also want to say that I develope these weird tics randomly and it usually last around 1 or 2 months and these have made it extremely hard for me to concentrate on any work that I'm doing

I hope that this is the right sub to post this 

Sorry for the bad English "
"So... What are your favorite or go-to depression coping hacks, habits and etc. that help your break your negative depression patterns? 

I have a few.
If I am struggling to do anything but loathe my self in bed it helps me to take a bath, set a timer for 15 min for whatever small step tasks I want to do( e.g. dishes or tidying up). 

If I am in a more sane place journaling helps me. I first write about my worries and then I try to approach them from a more rational stand point - a kind of worry analysis. 

Another thing I am trying out is when I a have a small episode of overwhelmed I take three breaths and try to ask my gut - what would be the right thing for me to do as my next step? Have I set an unrealistic expectation for myself? How can I approach it so it becomes more realistic and good for me? 

Look forward to hear what kind of small strategies and hacks that work for you ! "
"I‚Äôm 15 years old, female and i‚Äôve been having a lot of memory loss lately. Like today, when i was working out i would randomly forget what set im on and what rep, and during my shower i would be washing one arm then forget if i did the other, and things like that. Does anyone one why this could be happening?"
I recently lost my wife and I'm going through the stages of depression. I don't know how to go through this. They have been married 10 years been together 15 and I don't know how to cope with this I feel so alone even when I talk to people is there any help out there.
"TW: mention of suicide

Just wanted to come and share a bit of my story in hopes to provide some motivation or encouragement. 
I attempted to take my life 6 months (and one day lol) ago and consequently, my entire life fell apart. My roommate was no longer comfortable living with me due to months of my depression &amp; then the trauma of the attempt so after over a month of being in intensive treatment/hospitalization, I moved back in with my parents. I lost my new job that was a big dream come true for me, my car almost got repoed, I lost friends, it just all came crashing down.

The past 6 months have been grueling, exhausting, and so hard but I‚Äôve been trying so hard to be consistent and show up for myself. I‚Äôve been taking my meds, reconnecting with old friends, taking care of myself, and working so hard on the dark parts of myself. 

I can‚Äôt believe I made it another 6 months. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm not depressed, or that suicide doesn‚Äôt cross my mind, it does. But I‚Äôm okay. I‚Äôm not where I want to be in life but I‚Äôm alive, I‚Äôm okay, I‚Äôm finding purpose and peace with everything that happened.
I guess all this to say, I didn‚Äôt think I could make it another day but I‚Äôve made it 183 more days. I‚Äôm really proud of myself and wanted to share this in case you are struggling too. I believe in you, you can do this. "
"Been struggling with severe depression for the past 5 years. Came to terms with the fact that I've never actually tried to get better and just kind of accepted my faith. Today I forced myself out of bed and went to brush my teeth and cried like crazy while doing so, somehow that little thing made me emotional, but filled me with anger at the same time, like I snapped out for a second and had the chance to analyze my situation outside of my depression, a feeling that I cannot explain, haven't cried like this in a long long time. Such mundane tasks can take a huge toll on me, so I avoid them, but I'm done. I'm really going for it this time, haven't left my house since the year started, haven't felt joy in so long, comfort zone can really kill a person from the inside out, to the point where you become a puppet of your own mind, and you just exist for the sake of existing.
I'll keep updating this in case anyone is interested. 

This will be a long journey but I'm determined.
My best wishes to everyone in the same situation as me"
"My life is great. I‚Äôm about to graduate and I‚Äôm nervous but I have a nice life. Today tho I tried to write down on paper why I do things and why I live and that made me feel really stressed and sad. I‚Äôm trying to let go of these sad feelings but I‚Äôm just so fuckibg sad. Like I try to keep my mindset positive but even with positive thoughts I‚Äôm just so fuckibg sad like I hate myself. I have no friends and I just want love and support but I know that‚Äôs never going to happen. I‚Äôm extremely confused about my life and I know I‚Äôm fuckibg stupid for letting these feeling eat me up but I‚Äôm just so sad. Like I‚Äôve just been laying in my bed staring at the ceiling. I don‚Äôt even have a reason to be sad other than my life overall. 

I‚Äôm an extremely motivated person I try to be perfect but it hurts so bad. Trying to be perfect hurts and accepting I‚Äôm a peice of shit also hurts. I feel like a fuckibg teenager like I haven‚Äôt been depressed since I was like 15 and I‚Äôm 18 now and I‚Äôm just so scared. Like if I was in a perfect life I just want love and acceptance but I know I‚Äôll never have any of that. I‚Äôve kinda just accepted this and I don‚Äôt even try to have friends of relationships anymore because I hate myself so much I can‚Äôt see anyone ever liking me.

Idk what to do I can only just continue to live but I hate this feeling. Like I feel sad and cry a lot but this is like a deep hatred I have for myself coming through. Like I‚Äôve been thinking positively and that‚Äôs really the only thing that can get me out of depression. I just wish I could have friends who care. I wish I was t this confused."
"How do you ‚Äúfind something to look forward to‚Äù when you don‚Äôt care about anything and don‚Äôt feel anything (emotionally). 

26F. I‚Äôve been told I would benefit from finding something to look forward to, to just take it one step at a time and try to live in the moment. I found a few things to do (tennis, running, and a social group that goes on outings together) after trying a bunch of other crap (choir, writing club, church, art groups, book club, knitting group). I go to these three activities but they aren‚Äôt enough to push me out of suicidal thoughts. I leave them and feel empty, nothing, and suicidal. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm a person. There‚Äôs nothing in my brain. People say when you‚Äôre in this state to just put one foot in front of the other. I realize I‚Äôve been doing that for a few months now, my life is fine (full time employed, apartment, activities) but mentally I‚Äôm about the same. I‚Äôve been active but I could end it all tonight and not care. I could do or not do these tasks and feel the same way. 

I‚Äôve gone to two psychiatrists and nothing really happened with the meds, then I stopped going to the psychiatrist because of my lack of care in being alive.

I guess I just struggle with feeling nothing, having nothing inside my head, feeling disconnected from my life, feeling totally alone, worthless, useless, boring, unintelligent, uninteresting. I know the final solution is to be useful to my community. I worked for a very service-oriented/scholarship school for high support autistic children and I was at one of my most suicidal times then (though I loved the kids and did everything for them. But I‚Äôd get home and just want to kill myself).

Anyway. I don‚Äôt know what to do to help. How do I find interest in things. Everything seems really futile and I do just want to commit suicide. Only thing keeping me from it is my mom and brother. They are my reason to stay alive, but it‚Äôs turned me into a soulless, lifeless person who just does task after task to fill time. Inside I feel nothing. I feel dead already. "
"Im not sure what to do anymore, for what seems like the longest time I have absolutely despised the idea of living. My life just consists of waking up early, going to a job that i have no passion for, and then getting home with no real energy left to do anything and just enough money to scrape by on bills so no going out and enjoying myself even if i had the time to. With that being said I've fully accepted that my life it's just completely meaningless, i am a wageslave and nothing more i serve no real purpose. But my girlfriend man, if theres one thing i did right in this world it was finding her. She's absolutely every bit of my dream girl described to the tee, she's constantly supportive and dedicates every second towards me. We just recently got our own place together 3 months ago and although pur relationships still very strong i can feel my self bringing her down, its hard to bottle up that i hate my life so sometimes i let that show around her, i can tell she wants me to be happy, any time i mention to her that i just despise my current living situation i can see her visibly get upset and blame herself. I dont know what to do i just want her to stay happy."
"I was recently discharged from the airforce about a month ago due an undiagnosed medical condition that I didn't know I had. Anyways, before that I quit my job and gave away a lot of my stuff. I was already pretty down on my luck being 38, with no tangible college and I've burned a lot of bridges so there are few to no jobs I can get that isn't ridiculously back breaking.

I had to move back in with my Mom and she exactly isn't good company. I'm trying to get a job. I finally did but its 40 miles away and when I tries to get an apartment nearby I found out when they did a background check my last landlord tried to screw me over and said I still had an open lease with them that I hadn't paid. 

I'm running out of options and opportunities. My mom constantly reminds me that I should have a career by now and 'be an adult. I can't stand being at home. All of my friends I had are gone. They either died or just aren't around so I have nobody to talk to nor anybody to hang out with. I'm severely depressed and I lack a lot of support/resources. So I just repress it so I'm not overwhelmed."
"I have been struggling with depression since I was still in school and self care has always been my biggest road block. I promised myself today that before getting into bed tonight I would brush my teeth (I struggle with this the most). Proud of myself for doing something that to a lot of people is so minor. Hoping to get back into some sort of self care routine one small task at a time. 

If you‚Äôre reading this and struggling, you can do the thing you think you can‚Äôt! 
I put on a tv episode which distracted me while I brushed my teeth and got myself ready for bed and it helped so much so I wasn‚Äôt overthinking everything. Maybe a little excessive but it worked for me haha"
"Lately, I've been good with doing my workout but today I just wanna stay in bed. I also didn't eat despite of hunger pangs. But I should probably eat because I feel more sad if I don't eat. Idk I'm just rambling.

How are you today?"
"Time and time again I came back for her because she‚Äôs spiraling without me. I can‚Äôt say anything that isn‚Äôt gonna hurt her, and I certainly can‚Äôt leave without her crumbling down either. 

I was on my last straw yesterday. I just wanted to talk to her but she couldn‚Äôt talk without spitting all those hateful words to herself, to me, to everyone. She said I should just let her die and leave. I warned her, begged her, I told her I wanna stay but I can‚Äôt if she continued to push me away. I‚Äôve never threatened her with my departure before, but I genuinely could not take it anymore. So I left after my last attempt. Perhaps realization hit her. She started begging me to stay again.

I‚Äôve prepared myself so many times before. I‚Äôve been telling myself that I can‚Äôt be responsible for her happiness or suffering. But when that moment comes it just went all away, and I stayed. It‚Äôs back to square one again and we‚Äôre starting this over. When is this gonna end?

She‚Äôs not in her right mind at the moment. I‚Äôm probably not either. I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt the right place to ask for such help. I really need some advice. What should I do?"
"I‚Äôm going clean for 445 days now. If anyone needs help in their darkest times, I‚Äôm open. Vent all your problems and I‚Äôll listen. I‚Äôll try helping as much as I can, but all I want to say is. If you‚Äôre depressed and/or have tried killing yourselves, even if only in thought, don‚Äôt do it. The dark days don‚Äôt last, and a brighter future awaits. Hold tight and you‚Äôll see happiness. I‚Äôm here to help in the interim."
"I call it my ‚Äúhouse bag‚Äù!

It‚Äôs basically a big bag with lots of compartments, meant for crafting and storing art supplies etc., but I instead fill it with all of the things I need for day to day life.

I take the bag all around the house with me and I have done for years - it‚Äôs with me when I go to bed, and I bring it back downstairs when I get up.

I can‚Äôt even explain how helpful this has been. I do feel a bit strange for doing it, as I‚Äôve not seen similar online anywhere (not that this matters!!), but having all my toiletries, medications, small electronics etc. to hand helps me so much when I either can‚Äôt get out of bed or can‚Äôt get off the sofa.

It also gives me so much flexibility, as I can decide to, for example, take my makeup off and put my deodorant on whilst I‚Äôm on the sofa, rather than having to go to the bathroom to do it, which means I have to take one less step before going to bed. These are all things that help me live around my depression symptoms.

An example of some of the things I keep in my house bag!

Deodorant, Medication and vitamins, Headphones, Handcream, Moisturisers, serums and SPF, Makeup remover, Waterless toothbrushes and floss sticks, Cotton buds and rounds, Glasses cleaning cloth, Mini desk fan, Hand cream, Plasters

I really hope this helps someone :) (wish I could post a pic to show you my bag!)

"I loved her so so much, she was one of the reasons I'm still living, I couldn't even meet her during her last days because I had my fucking exams. She was in the ICU. She passed away. She was an angel, she's been through so much in life, she didn't deserve this world. I think I'll be alright in a few days, but what concerns me is my mother's mental health. My mother is not eating anything and she keeps crying. I understand her fully, but she's also delirious, she's talking all sorts of things like in the ICU ward she said that everyone of you is going to die and that the doctors are murderers. I don't know how to comfort, help her. Can someone please help me? Thank you for listening to me."
"I was diagnosed with cancer a few weeks ago, and it's frightening. I haven't talked to my mom about this because I'm worried about how she will handle it; she's my best friend, and this will devastate her. Additionally, I need to break the news at work, but I'm unsure how to approach it. Everything is going to change, and I need advice on how to approach both my mom and my boss and coworkers so this situation doesn't spiral out of control. I want to handle this news as responsibly as possible. Help me please"
"I apologize for the lengthy post but here‚Äôs a part of my life story :

I just turned 24, my mother raised me as a single mother and i grew up as an only child. Our family is decently wealthy, but responsibility and strictness comes as a cost. As much as i try to wrap my head around how my childhood was, the most prominent memories were the ones being scolded borderline insulted by her, getting hit sometimes, and being deprived from having interaction with friends. I don‚Äôt blame her for the way she raised me, she‚Äôs the most hardworking woman i‚Äôve seen and what she was did was for the best in her perspective.

 As a result, i grew up to be deeply lonely, never opened up with anyone about the things running in my mind and developing what i later discovered to be anxiety from the age of 12. Going outside, being around strangers or trying to talk to people felt like standing at the bottom of a deep pool, always pressured, stomach kept turning, always felt like puking, kept on puking air ( or burping ). From a young age to the end of high-school, i found myself always trying to ‚Äúimpress‚Äù people, always trying to at least mean something to someone, anyone. Despite having advantages and privileges that my surroundings wished they had, i‚Äôve always felt worthless. 

My previous relationships revolved around me being attached to my partners, caring loving deeply and always adjusting to the point where i don‚Äôt know how myself used to be anymore. The last relationship before i got to uni was the one that broke me the most. Usual night call turned into less call then no call, then to being irritated when i asked if i could see her face after a long day. Turns out she was calling her ‚Äúbestfriend‚Äù who was a brother to me. She brought the guy home, fucked, and her own friends broke it out to me. 

That combined with the highs and lows of my life resulted in me spiraling into depression while going to uni. I lost all sense of what i‚Äôll do with life. Failed my first year,got through it after 3 more years despite covid. Currently, i‚Äôm sinking back and forth into depression, despite building up an ego to cover the void inside, i can‚Äôt help but still feel like a failure and feel like i won‚Äôt be about to achieve anything.
 I already forgot what happier feels like, and i don‚Äôt know when and how i‚Äôll be happier. 

So to whoever‚Äôs feeling like they‚Äôre worthless and going through depression, remember you‚Äôre not the only one going through it. We‚Äôll make it out happier someday i believe. Even though i can‚Äôt picture myself reaching that point."
"I wasn't sure what reddit group to put this in but here goes:

So im 25 and grew up workin class immigrant low income but not poor per se in Canada. Because of this I spent my whole career chasing money. However by a twisted set of fate or irony it seems i failed at that too. From working and living at home I managed to save up 100k (but canadian monopoly money not usd) but still and yet because the price of housing in canada is so expensive i feel that even if i had 200k for a downpayment I couldn't get anything more than a 1 bed condo maybe 2.

The worst of all this is the mental toll i took on, in trying to chase money. I picked a career i dont really find all that enjoyable in the tech sector. Im not in the greatest health because while not life threatening i do have a rare gland issue which down the road could cause problems. My dating game is going shit rn and so I feel like i just navigated life all wrong whereby I ended up in a career i dont really enjoy, didnt even get the materialistic benefits that money would bring, im single, and I can't even take solace knowing that my health is good.

Open to any advice, tips, or comments you all have."
"I‚Äôm so fucking tired of being so fucking sad. I‚Äôll pull myself out of the dark place, only to have the universe throw me right back in with more pain, more anguish, new information, new experiences and bad memories to add to that little box in the back of my head I try desperately to keep closed. It gets harder and harder to come back every time. 

Life has been exhaustingly cruel over the last few years. I miss who I used to be. I feel like I‚Äôll never see that girl again. She died when my Daddy died almost 2 years ago. And ever since, things continue to pile on. I honestly don‚Äôt even know who I am, who I have become, who I‚Äôm supposed to be anymore. I don‚Äôt recognize myself at all. 

I try so so fucking hard every gd day to start fresh. But then some days it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm catatonic and I cannot move. 

There are so many layers to what is, was and has become my life. And I apologize for being so cryptic. I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm here writing this."

"My gf (25) of two years has been diagnosed with MDD anxiety for three years now. She takes medication and sees a therapist everyone other week. It has been a rough month for her including her family dog dying and major changes at work. 

Yesterday we got into a disagreement after she had unintentionally said some hurtful things and I had sent a text telling her how it made me feel and asking her to go about it differently. This spiraled into a bigger argument than it should have as we were both feeling attacked. We have put the argument behind us with us agreeing to work on things we did to cause it. Add to it that she lives with her mom who often a major stressor in her life and is in a deep depressive episode. 

She keeps saying that she can‚Äôt do anything right, that I don‚Äôt love her anymore, and that she ldoesn‚Äôt want to be on this world‚Äù anymore. I have tried to reassure her I love her, I have told her how proud I was of her for the things she has done today such as make her bed, go to a workout class, and eating a little bit after not eating all day. I know those seem small but they can be feel climbing mountains when she‚Äôs depressed. 

I‚Äôm worried about her because she has also canceled her therapy appointment for tomorrow because ‚Äúit hasn‚Äôt made her better after years‚Äù and she is barely eating. 

We are planning on spending the weekend together and I have planned on making her favorite foods and doing some of her favorite activities but I wanted to see if I there is any other advice on how to help support my gf through this episode and encourage safe and healthier habits? 

TL;DR: Do you have any advice on helping a loved one through a depressive episode and encouraging healthy habits?"
"I‚Äôve posted here before, and I have my waves of ok days and shit weeks. 

I just have been having a recent wave of numb, sadness at the choices I‚Äôve made in the past. A feeling of unworthiness that I‚Äôd never be worthy of love or happiness again. 

Knowing the stuff I‚Äôve been capable of in the past has been frightening to reflect on and I‚Äôm so devastated by all that I‚Äôve done, and all the hurt I‚Äôve caused, to the people I love most. It‚Äôs caused me to lose a lot of people and a lot of self respect.

Over the last 7 months I‚Äôve worked so hard on myself, and I‚Äôm proud of the growth I‚Äôve made. 

But I‚Äôm still carrying the feeling that I‚Äôll never be worthy again, so why keep going?"
"This week I (45f) was let go from my job. It came quite unexpectedly, since there had never been any official complaints about me or my performance. My boss often said *we* had to do better, but he never singled me out, so imagine my surprise, when he told me the reason was because my performance was lacking and I had been making too many mistakes.  
Honestly, I was gobsmacked!  
I always did my best and tried my hardest to deliver good quality work.  

In 2008 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I have been struggling with it ever since. I never let it impact my work though! Not once did I call in sick because I barely made it out of bed, or because my anxiety had kept me up all night...  
Mabe the use of anti-depressants for so many years has impacted my brain?  
Can one do a crappy job without noticing it?
My job gave me validation that I didn't otherwise get, so I did what I could to justify that validation.  
  
What's done is done, I guess, but my self-esteem is down the crapper, and every job description I read makes me break out in a cold sweat, my mind screaming ""I can't do this!"" and my stomach feeling like ice cold acid.  

I'm sorry, I know I picked the flare ""advice needed"", but I don't actually know what I want to know. My head is a mess and I'm barely holding on to my sanity.  

What do I tell people?  
I don't want anybody knowing that I wasn't good enough for my job!  
How do I get over the anxiety of having to find a new job?  
If I can't find a job that pays at least the same as my last one did, then I'll have to give up my appartment and move in with my parents.  

There are so many thoughts spinning in my head, I can barely breathe!  
I feel so humiliated, lost and broken... üíî"
"So my mom is pretty abusive like in words and I can't tolerate anymore. My mom was my role model since childhood as days went she become bitter. She's normally a control freak. Today I prepared chicken and she wasn't eating so served everyone else and we had guest so leftover was little which I informed her later she started saying me a slut for eating everything. Actually it was opposite and she started to say many unkind words which hurts very bad which made me cry without realising and this is not first time this happening. I can't bear anymore and I'm loosing coz I'm controlling not to get angry which makes me think to kill myself many times. People may think "" oh this is silly... if u feel like killing for mom's scolding then everyday I should have"" NO it's not and you don't understand to be with a person who constantly never satisfied of the work u do for them and always triggers you the worst out of you just coz they're n bad mood and shift to someone else... idk guys what will be ur suggestions??"
"it‚Äôs crazy to see how much my depression has derailed my life. i‚Äôm 24 now and spent a lot of time from being a teenager til now taking snapchats and photos of basically everything. 

at 18-20, i was beginning to accomplish so much, i have videos of myself after simple stuff like building my bed frame looking so damn proud and so happy to have my own space that i provided myself w my hard work. videos of my cats living a happy life in a comfortable space with me. being with friends and going on adventures almost daily. 

since then i‚Äôve lost almost everything. i don‚Äôt have my own space anymore, i‚Äôm pretty much homeless, no job, almost no friends, my cats aren‚Äôt with me, i can see in my face how much the stress and everything has changed me. i‚Äôm going to be 25 in less than two months and i want those feelings of accomplishment and pride back so badly. i want my own space again so badly. i‚Äôm on the verge of pushing myself back into the workforce knowing i can‚Äôt handle it but i have no other choice. i want to be happy with my life so desperately. 

i know i can‚Äôt go back in time, its just so sad to me seeing how downhill i‚Äôve gone, knowing if i had the mental wellbeing to do better i wouldve but i couldnt and still don‚Äôt think i can. but i don‚Äôt want to look back when i‚Äôm 50 and tarnished from a hard life, thinking how at 25 i still had so much in me to try harder and get what i had back. i want myself back

"A few months ago I was working a good job and getting decent money. I was eating healthy, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising at the gym five days a week doing cardio and weight-lifting (strength training) exercises. Not only that, but I was also excelling in my college courses. I was also working on meeting new people trying to make friends and taking care of my health.

All of these things I was juggling at the same time. It took a lot of drive and willpower. However, about two months ago, something happened that screwed up the good lifestyle I was maintaining and sent me into a bad depression. I have not worked a job in over a month. I quit the gym two months ago and quit exercising. I stopped eating healthy and started eating more than I should. I have gained weight since then.

I have started isolating myself now and sleeping more than usual. I match all the symptoms of depression. I lost the willpower and motivation I used to have so I have become confined indoors and just play video games daily. I can't even get myself to brush my teeth let alone work a job. Luckily I am still doing well in my college courses, although I have less energy to do them compared to before.

I need to get back on track again but how? I don't have the motivation."
"After several years with a severe depressionen without help I finally made the first steps.

Today was my first psychiatrist appointment.
I must say I had one of the worst days in months but I still managed to attend to the appointment I set for myself.

While I was in the waiting room, filling out some paperwork and waiting, I was as nervous as never before. 

The appointment was good (I guess) the psychiatrist was nice, he said it's pretty obvious that I have severe depression and diagnosed me. He gave me a few options for therapy and we talked a lot.

At home I told my parents and actually in a long time I felt relieved.

So now I'm sitting here, knowing that I definitely got depression, antidepressants, a lot to think about and a new (therapy) appointment next month.

I feel a bit more calm, relieved and a bit like I could actually sleep a bit better tonight.



(Sorry for my grammar, English is not my first language)"
"In a month I'll be a year unemployed. I was fired from my last job, and financially....it's not great at the moment. I've been applying to shit whenever I can, but it's hard to be consistent when it doesn't feel like it's paying off. Every job either requires more experience then I have, is too far by bus for them to hire me, is a clear scam, or never gets back to me. I have no routine anymore, but I have no willpower to do anything about it. I should be more proactive, but the just the idea of showing up in person to apply gives me panic attacks. 

Even if I got a job, I feel like I'd be fired right away. I do not appear friendly, I'm hard to get along with, and I'm shy. I know I'm responsible and hard-working, but everyone fucking says that so that's not marketable enough. And what am I supposed to say to why did you get fired? That my parents got me fired? That's what happened but who the hell is going to believe that? I sound like a complainer. Corporations hate complainers. 

I want to keep going to therapy so I don't turn out like my fucking parents. I want to pay off my credit card debt. I want to get on testosterone and have a routine and not eat ramen 3 meals a day. I feel like a total fucking loser, and it doesn't seem like it's ever going to get better. "
"I (21F) have being depressed since my late teens years but I was recently diagnosed and put through medication: I‚Äôve being taking those pills and seeing a specialist but I feel like nothing is getting better. I feel so sad, I cry nearly everyday. I feel hopeless, lonely, guilty, stupid.

I‚Äôve suffered from bullying during my middle and high school years which led me to have serious anxiety and very low self esteem.

Actually, I feel like I‚Äôm failing everything, my life is falling apart and I don‚Äôt deserve to be happy. And I just want to end it all. I just want the thoughts to stop invading my head.

I have trouble sleeping, eating, memorizing and every effort is so hard for me. I‚Äôve dropped one of my greatest dreams to become a dancer because I think that I‚Äôm not good enough.

I don‚Äôt know anymore what to do in my life. I‚Äôm lost and it seems as I don‚Äôt have any solutions. No one cares about how I feel and I‚Äôm sure if I ever go no one will cry about it. Like it‚Äôs only when you‚Äôre gone that people remember you. Everyone as always ignored my desperate signals.

The anxiety is so high I can‚Äôt go to school anymore. 
I‚Äôve failed school, my dreams, my financial situation.
I feel so drained, tired. I pretend being a strong one infront of others but I‚Äôm internally no more alive. I know only anger and sadness.

If you ever ask, being depressed is taboo in my family so it isn‚Äôt something they think can ever happen to any of them. I‚Äôve talked about it but no one cares not even the members of my family. My friends know but never ask if I‚Äôm ok. I‚Äôm lonely. I‚Äôve always being weak and the hated one.

Sometimes I used to text my best friend saying I‚Äôm not okay but she takes so long to answer that if I was about to kill myself no one will stop me.

My boyfriend can‚Äôt help me much too, I‚Äôve drowned to far down. 

I don‚Äôt deserve to be happy. I don‚Äôt have any choice anymore. But at the same time I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt know if I will see 2024. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore except kms."
"I've been depressed for my entire life. Even as an elementary school kid I was displaying symptoms. Now I'm 26 and finally taking Prozac. It's like magic.  I've cried once in two weeks instead of nearly every day, I've not had sudden bursts of anger, and I've caught myself actually smiling at random things throughout the day.

The thing is, I didn't realize it was all depression.  I thought it was just life stress from work and health issues. So how the heck do I know when I'm at the sweet spot for dosage?  This feels like enough, but before being unmedicated felt like enough, so I trusty own world view a little less. I know ultimately this decision will be up to my psych, but I'd like to see other people's thought on this too"
"Everyday just seems worse than the last. I'm 33 years old, single, and no kids. And because of that I hold no value to my family. They basically treat me like an indentured servant. There are times I try to talk to them, but only to be shut down. My relationship with my little brother has become strained. Growing up we were basically inseparable, but now he won't even really talk to me, unless he needs something. And I never tell him no. About a month ago he asked to me to dog sit for him, which is nothing new. But at the time I was going through a lot. I had just met a girl who I liked a lot, but her friends didn't seem to like that. They were making my life hell to the point where I was ready to just get out of town for awhile. When I finally did what was best for me, about an hour later is when he asked me to dog sit the next day. I told him no several times. I told him if I came back to that town, I was gonna do some crazy shit. He didn't really seem to care. His small problem was more important than mine. So I put his priorities in front of mine, and now I wish I hadn't. I was back in my hometown an hour before I ended up in a fist fight. Now I got these little dickheads running to the cops telling them I sell drugs. So now everytime the police see me, I get stopped and searched. It's a small town so they get away with that shit, because it's my word vs theirs. Well when my brother found all this out, his response was only concern for himself. He was worried about me bringing any unwanted attention to him or his family. I even warned him this shit was a possibility beforehand, because the unlawful searches had started before I bailed. I tried to explain myself but he just left me on read. 
  The girl I had started talking to basically let it slip that she only hangs out with me because of the stuff I do for her, and that there was no way she would ever date me, and then flat out told me the guy she was actually interested in. It hurt a lot. I feel like I've lost everything that matters to me. Now I'm being pressured by my mom to come to family Christmas for the kids. All while she defends my little brother tooth and nail, cause apparently that guy does no wrong. I don't want to go. I don't know what to do. If I tell any of this to my mom, my brother, or my sister they will just commit me. It wouldn't even be out of a place of concern for me. They just don't want to lose their servant. 
  The stress and anxiety have caused me to stop sleeping, and my appetite is completely gone. I'm lost and I don't know how to go forward anymore. I'm hanging by a thread at this point and I'm ready to just pack it in and call it quits"
"How do I get the support or help for my active thoughts without me having to go to the hospital? I wanna talk to someone and get the help but I don't want the hotline or whoever to have me hospitalized. And I feel like that hotline won't help unless they know I have an active plan. I really wanna act on these thoughts but at the same time I'm afraid of the side effects so I want the help, but not have to be hospitalized for 3 days- a week or more"
"I have been suicidal from past few months, not anymore. I won't entertain these suicidal thoughts anymore. I am going to live and all decisions from now on will be for that. The reason behind this is my family (my parents and my sister). Today my mom and dad talked to me regarding how I've been acting lately. I always thought everyone will be better off without me, the world will be a better place without me. I've always hated myself to the core, I don't even remember when did I last thought about being happy. I've been in depression and in the last 6 months I've pretty much gone through everything. Even if I try I couldn't bring myself to think that I could ever be happy. I was almost dead from Inside.

Everyday I used to wake up and think about how can I just end myself and this pain but during this maybe I forgot how much my parents have gone through to take care of me throughout these years. I used to think they'll get over it eventually but maybe that's not true. I saw in their eyes that I am something for them. I am a 21 year old living with my parents. While most of my friends have started their life and job, I am here living off my parents money. They noticed how I've been acting strange lately...they still have no idea about me being suicidal but today they talked to me regarding how I should not give up in life, how it's never too late, how eventually it will work out and even if it doesn't still it's not a big deal. I never thought a guy like me could be that much important to someone. So guys I won't give up, I'll die trying but I won't give up. I still have no clear career path and I'm still that useless guy with no real talent  but I'll figure something out. If I can just devote myself completely then something will work out eventually right. I don't want to be a millionaire or something just a regular guy who can give his parents a good life. Maybe this is also like all of those attempts that I made to change my life but I won't give up anymore. No suicidal thoughts anymore. I will give this life a good try. Wish me luck guys, I hope you all make it as well. Thanks for reading my story...have a great life."
"Like the title says, bc I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who essentially is fighting the good fight on their own. 

I‚Äôm a 27(f), I live in a major city with my cat and have been dealing with my depressive episodes on my own, I‚Äôm tired of it. Yet, it very much feels like this is just the way things will be. So I‚Äôm just wondering how any of you deal with it?

I‚Äôm going thru a bad episode right now and I was hospitalized over the summer for my issues. I live with a roommate but she‚Äôs often preoccupied and tries to be helpful when she can, but just doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to be supportive in the way I need her to be. I have friends here, but they are often too preoccupied with their own selves and lives that I don‚Äôt wanna bother them. I also have long distance friends but I am paranoid about them and their support. I cannot turn to my family for support, up until my last hospitalization, they belittled my mental health problems and often made them worse, I am currently in mostly no-contact with my mother because of her treatment of me from my last hospitalization and I can sort of talk to my dad, but it‚Äôs difficult although he‚Äôs trying his best to understand. 

I needed to provide that background info so you can better understand where I‚Äôm at. 

I find myself slipping again. I can barely get myself to eat, sleep is not great. I‚Äôm struggling with my jobs again which I can‚Äôt let happen again (my depressive episode that led to my hospitalization created all sorts of work issues). 

What do you guys do to keep going and keep your life up? Bc I‚Äôm starting to feel like I can‚Äôt do it anymore."
"not sure if this is the right sub for this but i've been microdosing for about a month and it's helped a ton. borderline life changing. it made me realize how much time i used to spend being sad and how i would often use my sadness as a 'crutch', how it'd effect the music i listen to, shows i watch, etc.

in a way it feels like i don't know how to act now that i'm 'less sad'. anyone else ever feel this way? feels like i suddenly have more 'time' to do things. maybe i need a hobby or something. if so do you have any recommendations?"
"(25F)  


I don't have a job, I dropped out of college, I still live with my parents, and I feel like a disappointment. Everything takes so much energy out of me and I'm constantly embarrassing myself just by existing. I'm trying all that I can and I still don't know what to do. I wish I was different."
"As stated in title, had depression untreated until I was 30.  I had all the symptoms back in the very early 1970s, but no help for kids back then.  Had the condition wreak havoc in my life and lost a lot of things.  I have done a considerable amount of work to get to a better place.

Anyone have questions please feel free to ask.  I am not a doctor, but I have many years in another area of healthcare (none of was much use for depression lol).  Unfortunately helping one self is the most profound thing you can do for your disease, and it's not a big secret.  I am not a guru, just some guy who has seen the inside of many psych hospitals and lived to come out on the other side.

Peace!"
"I hate my life and I hate my sister more for making me hate it.It's  not her fault, nobody can help the way they were born or what they were born into, but I hate that I was born her brother. My mom can't take it anymore and I can't either. My sister has always been this way, but it has only gotten so bad in recent time. I know my sister has some kind of undiagnosed mental illness and we have tried to get her help. Each day it gets worse, each day builds on the last until it comes out. I wish I could continue to help her because deep down in my heart I still love her, but my body can't, my brain is splitting apart, I'm losing it. I wish we could put her in a facility, so she could get the care she needs, but I was born poor. My mom does all she can for an immigrant who can't speak English, I mean that in the nicest way, she is a saint that deserves the world and I love her more than anything. I once loved my sister the same. If something doesn't change soon, I'm going to leave and find a place no one will ever find me and end my life. I can't take it anymore and there is no other way out. I wish I could run, but the guilt of leaving my mother would be too much. I can't be happy while she suffers. We can't throw out my sister, the process and just the guilt of it would probably stop us before we could. This is truly a moment that I have no other options, at least none that I have any other balls to take. I wish my mom finds a way out, different then mine, and I wish I could somehow see it. I doubt I'll be going high enough though. Even hell wouldn't be so bad, but I don't believe in either. When I do it that will be it. I wish for the strength to do it soon. Or some help at least."
what the hell do i do.

"I have made so many mistakes in life. I ruined so many opportunities with women, investments (lost life changing money) relationships/friendships, etc. It‚Äôs hard not to beat myself up over these mistakes. I wish I could just let go and BE FREE!!! 

What‚Äôs the best way to forgive myself of the past? I want to completely let go and move on. It‚Äôs super hard for me to do so. "
How can I connect with god?
obviously i know you can‚Äôt stop depression because i‚Äôve definitely tried but lately i can feel it getting worse again and i can‚Äôt get all of these thoughts out of my head and it‚Äôs really really bad because school matters the most it ever has right now and i really can‚Äôt afford to feel depressed or unmotivated right now and if there are any tips to trying to even get enough energy to get out of bed for a little bit that would be great. i don‚Äôt understand though because i am still young i don‚Äôt understand why i feel like i can‚Äôt even move even if im starving or uncomfortable. but regardless now is not the time for me to feel like this so any tips would be really appreciated thank you

"Hey i'm 27M and have been diagnozed with depression a couple of years ago, i've always struglled with it and this was the second time where i had to take meds. I was really frustrating to relapse, since i thought i was ""cured"". I've been doing pshycotherapy for years now, almost since i was 15 and feel a bit stuck with meds since i had to restart taking them after a couple of years. I know antidepressants help but do they actually get to the cause of the depression? I honestly don't believe that taking meds will cure my depression, only getting to the root cause of it will. Anyone else feels this frustration? "
"My aim is to not not focus on bad feelings that are caused by circumstances that I cannot change. My Life is terrible and it's hard to change it when you are dragged down with these feelings.

"never thought id post on reddit about thos kind of stuff. Stuff has been going downhill fast for me (compared to my already descending mental health and in general for my age) Ive begun smoking, something which i used to despise even thr slightest scent of. Im beginning to drink hard liquor whenever i have time for it and im planning to ""obtain peace"" in about 12 days which would be halloween where i live. I just wanna make sure there isnt something im missing and that saying farewell to everyone and everything is fine"

"I‚Äôm utterly devastated after my ex girlfriend, who saved my life before we even got together (I was going to commit suicide previously), broke up with me. She was my whole world, and now I‚Äôm in constant agony that only gets worse, spending sleepless nights crying on the floor.

"By the end of the year i will turn 18 and it's the only thing that I'm a trully looking forward to. I want to spend that day like i want and at least feel appreciated. Apart from that i have no purpose or dreams and i already gave up on studying for my finals, as it puts too much pressure on me and i know it won't be a use to me anyway. 

How can i make the wait easier? Single days-objectives don't really work for me. It's getting harder everyday to get up and have any routine instead of wasting time, that makes the days and weeks last longer. I can't get the intrusive thoughts out of my head but I can't give in either yet, i just want to see my birthday. "
"Have you ever been at a party that wasn't all that great? The people there are all uptight and annoying, you're constantly surprised at all the stupid shit they do and say. The music is shit, there's no alcohol, nobody smokes and everyone looks dumb at you every time you open your mouth. The only reason you are even there is because you like this one person who invited you, so you want to be somewhat polite and not leave to soon. But all you think about is being somewhere else.

That is how I feel about this world."
I‚Äôm 14 and it‚Äôs been happening to me twice. I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm sobbing and crying to ppl that talk smack on me online ( they hated my art ).

"I have been in a serious relationship for 8 years with woman that has had to deal with depression off and on for years. I do my best to help and listen to her, I try to be sympathetic and give my advice when need or asked for. A few months ago she was diagnosed with a heart condition and medicating the condition messed with her depression and anxiety meds, about 3 months ago the day after we talked and she told me she loved me and missed me she just stopped answering calls and messages. After almost 2 months I was able to reach her by email, she told me she is safe and okay, she just wants to be left alone. I understand that depression/anxiety makes you not want to talk to anyone sometimes, I don't fault her for that. My question is when this happens do people ever come back around and want to talk again, if so how long does it normally take? I miss her, worry about her constantly and just want to provide any help for her I can. She is not only the love of my life but also my best friend and I would wait 1000 lives for her if I had to."
"
So I attempted suicide almost a year ago, went into therapy after that which I‚Äôm still going to, but the thoughts are kicking in again. I hate myself for not letting myself live again after going to therapy, I‚Äôm just surviving the whole time. The thing is, for every inconvenience I see suicide as the only way out. Like it‚Äôs my fault for everything and I should just die. My best friends which left me last year have been living their best lives, I can bet on my life they didn‚Äôt even think about my existence once since our fallout happened. They left me because I was too heartbroken at the time and was not able to leave my partner at the moment which they insisted on me to do. For context, my partner wasn‚Äôt physically abusive or anything, we just had a fight and they didn‚Äôt like my partner and made me choose. 
I know this seems maybe like a small issue to some, but please consider that I don‚Äôt have a family, friends and/or a partner are all that I can have. My family doesn‚Äôt care if I live or die, they are a bunch of evil and sick people. I don‚Äôt know why have they even brought me into this world if they are jusr going to leave me like that. I live in a very small city, no places to go out to. I fucked up my college as well so anything I have in my life rn really is just fucking screwed up. I want to die for the longest time, the thoughts never left, but I‚Äôm just scared to die. I Hate myself for that. Death is supposed to be peaceful, yet I still get scared when doing the attempt. "
I want to disappear. I don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone. I don‚Äôt want to attend school. I want to cut myself in half. I don‚Äôt want to do anything but still I do. I want to cut off all my relationship. I want to stay in a corner and hide.
"TLDR; I gave up on being an artist, I'm depressed and can't find purpose in life.How do I keep going and find a reason to live when I'm convinced it's not worth it?

Hi! I have 27 years old, and when I was young, I wanted to be an artist or make video games. I lived my life thinking I'll go to school, find a job and live my adult life, like everyone.¬†

I studied 3D animation (for vfx) and I got a major depression bc I realized its not what I want to do. I just went with that bc I thought art is the only thing I'm somewhat good at. But the truth is, I've put so much pressure on myself to perform that art stopped being fun for me. It stopped being fun a loonng time ago. I thought if I'm not good enough, I wont be able to get a job.¬†

Then, during the pandemic, I decided to go back to school to learn 3D modeling for video games. I thought maybe if it's in a field that I have more interest in, maybe it'll be different. But history repeats itself, the same thing happened. I barely applied to any job. I had to force myself to work on my portfolio. Then, the industry kinda became chaotic, no one could find any job. My depression got worse and I gave up on being an artist. It was sad but freeing, I no longer had pressure to perform..... but I had no direction now.

Since then, Ive been living on my savings, depressed, lost. Its been a year. I'm running out of money soon, I can no longer ignore the issue. I can't live in survival mode without a goal for too long. I need a reason to wake up in the morning, something that makes me feel useful. I need a new plan. A plan that will work this time.¬†

It's hard to find something you like, that you are good at and that pays enough to be comfortable. Especially when you think you are not good at anything. It's hard to go back to school when you are so depressed you can't do simple tasks. It's hard to motivate yourself when you think ""What's the point"", when you gave up on everything. How do you convince someone who no longer wants to live that they should? When all arguments are invalid to them. ""Imagine Sysiphus happy"", I can't live for a momentarily relief of suffering. The life that we are expected to live as lower/middle class doesn't seem enjoyable or worth it to me.¬†

Despite all this, a tiny part of me still hopes. The last tiny ember that pushes me to continue everyday. How do I preserve it? How do I make it stronger than depression? How do I find a reason to go on in spite of all the suffering?"
"I don't know if anybody else who is single feels this way, but another Friday or Saturday night alone Can sometimes be so depressing you just wanna scream or cry, but nothing comes out. I don't want to hear the love yourself do things alone, blah blah, blah, blah blah. Us single people we do, but that doesn't mean we can't feel this way about spending every weekend alone while our  friends and family are out doing things with their significant others or whatever it may be. Our feelings are valid, it can sucks to do everything alone, it would be nice to share an day/evening with someone. Sorry, just venting.. Sometimes the silence just gets so loud you need to express it somewheres. "
"28F 
Constantly feeling low, sad after the breakup. I've tried occupying self with new hobbies, reading more, working out, talking to my friends, but recently it just feels like there's no point in any of this. 
I was never a happy person  but content with life, now I'm just a depressed person. 
I feel like I'm dead, most of the time. Like simply doing what has to be done to, pretend like I'm alive for the sake of friends and family but I'm just dead inside. And I truly want to die soon, I don't think I'm suicidal like never have the courage to do something, but wish I'll die by something else.

"My boyfriend of 3 months is being abused by his parents and i dont know what to do, he has autism and adhd but his parents refuse to give him treatment, therapy or buy him his proper meds because they refuse to believe he has autism or adhd. They scream very loudly at him everyday and it hurts him physically and emotionally due to his level 2 autism, we are both underage. His mom wants him to move out asap even tough he is underage and not able to get emancipated, at least not yet. His parents verbally abuse him most of the time but there have been times where they physically abuse him, his mom once recorded herself laughing at him crying and throwing a fit for 5 minutes when he was a kid, they made him stand on his knees on the cold hard floor for over an hour for eating a piece of pie because ""he dindt ask"" his parents tell him he's gotta ask before even eating a single biscuit at their house, they demand a shitton of chores that are quite difficult for him to remember to complete due to his autism and adhd but since his parents neglect it they blame it on his laziness and disgusting attitude and scream very loudly at his ear just to hurt him more when he doesn't do what he's told or doesnt remember to do what he's told. He's gonna ask his mom to move out today since this is what she wanted all along because he does not want to call the police because he feels attached to them. Im so scared, i dont know what to do. He's tried escaping to a relative's house but his auntie snitched on us to his mom and she verbally abused him after. His brother snitched on his vents to him and told his mom too, even making fun of him. We cant trust even other family of his, and i'm so goddamn scared. Please help."

I was in a relationship for 10 years with someone who told me that after everything we have been through they don‚Äôt want to speak to me or be my friend. Very hurtful, I would never say that to them even though we broke up. 
I didn‚Äôt have the fun high school teenage years like everyone else did. I was working retail and restaurants at 16! With no help. My father is a piece of ‚Äî-. And my mother died of colon cancer when I was thirteen. I have had over 20 jobs. Between 13 and 29 (I am counting babysitting I was paid money to do a job I‚Äôm counting it!) that also made me feel older and not seen as someone who was an individual with individual desires. My 20s I still worked hard this time making 15-16 dollars an hour. I was in love and not married or having fun like other 20 years olds do.

I did get my AS in accounting. I ran away from home and got my own place.
Fell in love though it led nowhere.

All the while I have been very depressed and wanting to take my life. I would like to live life but I don‚Äôt know what the next year let alone 10 years are going to look like for me! 

I am sooooo fucking angry that I am not where I wanted to be and that I lost sooo many years of my actual youth to literal chaos and trauma! I know life is not fair and all but I don‚Äôt like being me anymore! It‚Äôs not fun! It‚Äôs not cute! 

I can‚Äôt write everything I have endured soo far in my life or I‚Äôd have a book. I sometimes get hopeful but then I am reminded that I don‚Äôt matter nothing does and what‚Äôs the point in going on. I am thinking about ending it this fall.
There is NO WAY the universe is going to continue to get joy out of my suffering and misery anymore.
I am going back ‚Äúhome‚Äù.

Who knows maybe I‚Äôll reincarnate but I don‚Äôt want to relearn basic things either.

My moods are up and down right now. But I don‚Äôt know or trust in anything or believe in anything soo I guess I‚Äôll just go ‚Äúhome‚Äù. And be free from this world.
Thanks for reading.

"I‚Äôm 22 y.o male in college and I‚Äôm considering ending it all. I‚Äôm actually done with my Academics but I need to complete another set of training for me to graduate because it‚Äôs a requirement for me to graduate. It‚Äôs actually very difficult to finish the training but failure is not an option. I have 2 sisters who did not finish school because of anxiety and depression and I‚Äôm the youngest one. My mom and my aunt are very supportive and provide me with everything I need. I even have a girlfriend who supports and love me. You might be wondering why I‚Äôm considering suicide in the first place? It‚Äôs because of me, the pressure I put myself through and the expectations i have for myself. I feel and know when I fail, everyone I love will abandon me. In my family they always call me ‚Äúthe last hope‚Äù of my mom, imagine if that last hope fail at college. I feel like social media is playing a part in it too, the mentality of i need to have something at my 20‚Äôs is ingrained in me, so when i try everything to make money and I fail, I feel like the biggest idiot in the world. It feels like I shouldn‚Äôt even be considering suicide, i have a mom and aunt that fully supports me and a girlfriend that loves me, but I don‚Äôt why i just want to end it. It feels like I have no purpose in life and it feels like i was born to just fail in everything that i do. "
"i (21 f) have been feeling extremely hopeless lately. i used to be able to ground myself by thinking of all the things to look forward to in life, but now i dont care about any of that anymore. its like so what? everything feels pointless and miniscule; i keep thinking of how we are all just on one planet in an empty universe, so why bother? i dont wanna feel this way; i never used to, even in my darkest periods. i just want to stop feeling so miserable"
"I (29F) have been dating my boyfriend (27M) for a little over 5 years. Since we‚Äôve been together, he‚Äôs always been anxious and has expressed his depression to me. Only recently has it began to surface into something he feels he can‚Äôt control at times. We relocated about a year and a half ago, away from family, friends, and everything familiar to us. We are on our own now, and while it has been a fun learning experience, we also have no one to turn to when shit gets rough. 

Since we‚Äôve moved here, my partner has had a difficult time keeping a job due to every single one of them being toxic - from the manager, to the employees, to just the overall work culture. He is such a people person and has been told by everyone from his previous jobs that he does so well. But his mental health took a big hit last year. He lost himself in the process and now struggles to find any potential in his life. He speaks to me about his thoughts turning suicidal but says he won‚Äôt act on it. He started going to therapy last year and is on depression and anxiety meds. He seems to be more aware of his triggers and when he starts to feel anxious but it feels like when it gets bad, it‚Äôs just really bad now. He constantly feels sorry for himself, for me, for everything that he cannot provide or do, and I am exhausted. 

I consider myself a very optimistic person, and I always try to get him to see the brighter side of things but I feel drained trying to reassure him him that things will be okay. I feel like his caretaker and I don‚Äôt want it to be like that. 

I try my best to put myself in his shoes and understand that his thoughts are not always ‚Äúhis‚Äù. He says it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs stuck behind a glass watching himself react to things in ways he never would if he didn‚Äôt have anxiety. 

He is doing his best - going to therapy, taking meds, doing the homework his therapist gives him, trying to be more mindful - so I know that he will get through this. He has just been getting anxiety attacks a lot quicker, which ends in argument because we cannot see each other‚Äôs pov in the heat of it all. 

After an argument, we talk about what happened and use it to better our future conversations, but I feel like it has come to a stand-still. 

I‚Äôve just been feeling so overwhelmed with having to take care of everything for so long. I don‚Äôt mind taking care of our joint bills (like rent, the car, etc) and my own bills. I haven‚Äôt even minded helping him pay his bills when he quit all of his toxic jobs. But when is enough enough? It‚Äôs getting to the point where I want to tell him to suck it up. I‚Äôm tired of him feeling sorry for himself all the time. If I bring up how I‚Äôm feeling, he just feels worse and it goes in a complete circle. 

I feel like many people will say the healthy thing is for me to leave. But I am not going to do that. I have weighed my options about us moving back home which is impossible right now. My bf‚Äôs good days are great and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just wish he would too. But I know the day will come and we will get through this. 

I‚Äôm not really looking for a response. I‚Äôve been doing what I know will help me stay sane. I keep a routine. Ive started going alone to the gym (which was hard for me at first but has definitely helped), take my dog to the park, etc. I think I just needed to let everything out because I have nobody here to really talk to. If you‚Äôve read this far, thank you. "

"I never people tell about my birthday because I don't want people to waste their thoughts on me. I don't host parties because I don't want people to waste their time on me. I have a few close friends who recently got me a birthday gift a few weeks ago and I acted thankful in the moment. But when I got home, I just cried because my loved ones wasted their hard earned money on someone like me. 

Hell, even a single compliment feels like pity or makes me think ""if only they knew that I wasn't actually good at X / good person / good friend / whatever"". Whenever people help me with anything, instead of just feeling grateful like a normal person, I feel like a burden and I feel guilty for being a bother. I never talk about my depression because I couldn't handle it if I made my loved ones worry. I never want to be the reason why my friends stop smiling.

It's so annoying because I *know* this is so stupid. I would never think like this about anyone else. I will gladly spend my energy, time and money on friends because they matter to me, they deserve it and I love them. But as always, I'm the exception to my own rule."
"(17F) ive made so many cries for help everywhere and i still haven‚Äôt found a single reason to keep going. yesterday it all set in when i got dumped and realized i got no texts from anyone the night of except from a girl at school asking me to use her shein code. nobody ever cares. i‚Äôve lost hope in love and in friendship. besides my ex who left due to circumstance, men in my generation are garbage people who call girls bitches and leave girls on read. friends don‚Äôt care about me no matter how lonely i seem, and i bet most people at school talk shit about me behind my back. ever since i was 6, i made plans to commit suicide at 18, and im scared at how soon that is but i want out so badly. if you knew my life story you‚Äôd know i was a lost cause from the start, and the future holds nothing for me. please. someone give me hope. give me a reason to keep going. i‚Äôve spent my entire life sleepwalking through it and i don‚Äôt want to live anymore"
"So here I am 36 years old married and have a child and a house. And honestly I couldn't be more depressed than I am. I don't know who the first person to say that the American dream was having a family and house was but I'd like to say I think they where wrong. Don't get me wrong I love my wife and daughter. I gues my issues are deeper than that tho I live paycheck to paycheck and my wife has a money spending problem. There's times that we are negative in the bank like 2 days before we get paid. I hate it I hate not having a cushion in the bank. Oh and did I mention that im a closet crossdresser borderline want to live as a woman, or and she knows I crossdress but she hates everything  about it and wants nothing to do with it ""you can do it when im not around"" god I hate my life I just wish I could be me and wish I wasn't so poor all the time it's killing me slowly. I'm 36 and have more grey hair than most 40 year Olds.

"I don‚Äôt have a job, no friends, and I resent being around my parents because of how they treated me throughout my whole life.

I‚Äôm so angry, bitter and sad all the time. I hate myself because of my past mistakes. I constantly feel like a terrible person because of my regrets from my impulsive behavior in the past. I hate the person I‚Äôm becoming. For some reason, I‚Äôm still trying to get a job, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm better off dead. I just keep imagining ways that I could die. No one would miss me. I think my parents would probably want me gone because my mentally illness constantly bothers them whenever I try to stand up for myself. I just want everything to stop. My life is such a shitshow, and I have the worse luck. So why keep living?"
"I‚Äôve been working a ton this summer. Like 7 days a week with no breaks. So I decided to ask for 2 days off because i felt tired of work and thought i might take a break. But now that i have these 2 days off I just feel bored. 

I usually just play video games when i‚Äôm not at work and they will get me through about half the day but after a few hours i don‚Äôt even really want to play video games anymore. I‚Äôve just been feeling like I don‚Äôt really have the desire to do anything. 

I have also unfortunately been cursed with being forever single so that‚Äôs probably affecting it somewhat but I was fine by myself before so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the main reason why i‚Äôm like this.

Any advice on how I can get through this summer? I‚Äôm usually fine when it‚Äôs not summer or winter because I have tons of school to keep me busy but when there‚Äôs nothing i‚Äôm really working towards it just sucks.

"My depression's been getting worse, I've been laahing out at people, and I've never felt more miserable and alone, but at the same time I feel like I deserve to be alone.

I also recently went through a breakup and that's been hurting a lot as well. I'm really sensitive and get upset over relatively minor things.

"the thought alone of my boyfriend laying on the floor of his bedroom after overdosing (which he has already done) makes me so sick and terrified, i get nightmares. i was out with my family on friday, only to get texts from him at the end of the day saying he was feeling suicidal again...

we talked it out and he‚Äôs still with me, but it can get so despairing. he complains everyday which gets a little overwhelming for me. i asked him about therapy but he said it‚Äôs not an option for him anymore‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs tried several times in the past which have all failed him. as of now i‚Äôm his only support system, aside from his mother.

i want to cry so bad. i do my best, call him everyday to distract him or check up on him, and always remind him  of his value in my life. sometimes it just isn‚Äôt enough. he says he can't remember the last time he had peace or fun in his life. when he describes his situation to me, i genuinely feel his hopelessness too and it tears me apart. but i care too much about him to ever give up on him.

i‚Äôm just at a loss right now, really scared and desperate to get him the help he needs. he knows what he wants but they‚Äôre all unattainable at this point in time. what can i do now?"
"I can't take this anymore. After hearing the woman I love the most in the world say she just doesn't want anything to do with me and that she likes other guy has been most painful and I can't continue my normal life with this pain and thoughts.

She's my world and everything and means everything to me and I refuse to live a life unloved and alone, I just don't want to keep feeling this pain anymore and I don't know other exits.
And no, friends aren't the answer for me, I want romantic love, no friend support, and if it's not with the one woman I love I'd rather just die. Life alone and unloved isn't life and besides I have absolutely nothing going for me anyway since I'm unemployed and finding jobs is extremely difficult for me.

I'm not ugly, I'm not a bad guy, maybe the universe just hates me but I don't want to give the universe the pleasure to keep making me suffer. I really really want to just die during my sleep without pain to just stop feeling this. I can't live like this anymore "

"At least since I was 11 (22 years ago) I have experienced suicidal thoughts on a daily basis and still do. Diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety and started to receive treatment 11 years ago. Since then been on 3 different meds, had 5 rounds of CBT, 2 hospital admissions and 3 attempts at suicide, but I‚Äôm still here so ask me anything. Hoping to encourage anyone out there feeling hopeless that things can get better. 

Note: my suicidal thoughts are a compulsive OCD style thought that developed as a coping strategy to trauma in my younger years. These thoughts develop into desires and urges in my depressive episodes. I have had a long time to come to terms with and understand my condition though this I s still an ongoing process. Everyone experience mental health difficulties in a different way, so I don‚Äôt assume to understand anyone else‚Äôs condition, but I do have compassion and empathy for anyone suffering and hope I can be some encouragement to at least one person that there is hope.

Ask me anything"

"27 year old Indian male here. I grew up in a helicopter parental strict household. Was screamed at for masturbating, was not allowed to date, and never got the birds and bees talk.

I was bullied for a majority of my life to the point where I planned my suicide in high school and college. I was bullied for having crushes. I cried myself to sleep. I became a alcoholic in college. Tried to drown the pain.

Fast forward - I am on dating apps. Try different things, and go to meet up events. Go to therapy semi regularly, travel solo and with friends, workout, have my masters degree, love to read, and am a city planner. I'm extrovertive, am writing my first fiction novel, and recently got into photography.

I am still damaged goods. Never had mutual interest romantically with anyone. Maybe I'm just a worthless sack of shit destined to be alone. I'm so tired. So, so, so tired. Tired of trying. Tired of being alone. I have no confidence as I have nothing to be confident about.

"My wife is diagnosed with bipolar 2. When she's fine, she's fine. When she's not, she's really really not. The depression periods just kind of hit quickly and stick around for a while. She's going through a depression right now, and she says all she wants is to be alone. She doesn't seem suicidal at the moment. That has happened before, and those are way more intense. I would not call it any less severe, though. She'll lay in the bathroom or closet and sleep for hours and say she just wants to be alone. She doesn't want anyone to touch her. She won't eat.

She is on medication, but it's not working very well and she refuses to look into it because when she feels fine, she feels fine and doesn't think it's a problem. She won't talk to a therapist because she says she's seen so many and none of them helped her.

"This post may be upsetting because it discusses the topic of suicide attempts in the past. It's not graphic, I assure you.

--/

Seven months ago, I tried to kill myself.

In the immediate aftermath, I was relieved to be alive, but soon regressed back to suicidality.

I then decided that I would fight to live on for the sake of those who cared for me, but with no intrinsic desire to remain alive.

Now, finally, after all this time, I can say that I want to stay for this show -- for my own self.

And suddenly, there's a whole bunch of things happening. I'm getting intrusive images which are both memories and visions of my death. I instinctively wince at these before I realise what has happened. My heartbeat goes supersonic and my face becomes as hot as a summer day. I even lose my balance sometimes.

Emotionally, there's multiple issues:

1. There was a significant duration in which I thought that I was going to die and that no amount of medical help could change that. Just experiencing that has changed me.

2. Physiologically speaking, I don't know how I am alive. I'm not being dramatic here. I didn't gently approach the line between life and death and then back off. I ran full speed towards that line, too fast to stop. And yet, here I am.

3. When I think of what would have happened after I had died, if I had died, my eyes must up. I feel guilty, utterly guilty, when I think of what mum, dad, sis, and friends would have had to go through if I had died. Including the discovery of the body, the last rites... And their grief. Their self blame. My throat's going all chokey as I type this.

4. I'm terrified that my demons will return to finish what they started. There's nothing too substantial keeping the lid on them.

So, yeah. All this is swirling in my heart.

I know I need a trauma therapist, but apart from that.... What do I do? How do I forgive myself? How do I stop seeing myself as being a bad person for what I've done?"
"What do I need it for anyways, life is pointless.. 9-5 till I die yeah I don't think so.. how to deal with this, I am depressed as shit. I just do 9-5 and then nothing. I am just existing, life ended when I got a job. I was happier broke and student than now with some money and job. Is suicide an only option?

"Whenever the depression is too strong, I just lose all the energy and motivation to do anything. At those moments I keep repeating to myself ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù and repeat self-destructive mantras that ruin my plans. 

Take the gym for example, it‚Äôs so hard to hit the gym and exercise when I‚Äôm so deep in depression, and gym requires discipline. But how can you stay disciplined when you‚Äôre so devoid of energy? 

I‚Äôve had these moments since my university years and it‚Äôs destroyed me each time. I don‚Äôt want to live my whole life like this. 

Isn‚Äôt there any instant shock thing I can do to instantly get out of these Mariana Trench levels of depression? I don‚Äôt want to get hooked on anti-depressants, so please if you can recommend anything but that. "
"This stress and anxiety are finally off my dam back, I now am finding joy in life. I‚Äôm now finding myself throwing my anxiety and stress into an open fire and watching it burn down in front of me. And it‚Äôs been enjoyable for me I‚Äôve been reading the outsiders which I haven‚Äôt even finished yet but I‚Äôll get there and after will consider reading Dante‚Äôs Inferno. I‚Äôm even getting into stuff I wouldn‚Äôt normally get into like Greek mythology, books, Even saying a prayer at night! ( never did a prayer after we stopped going to church but I‚Äôm getting of topic-) And to the people struggling with depression, anxiety, etc. 
Your time is now! Those people who wronged you, show them how far you‚Äôve come! Be yourself! Don‚Äôt be afraid to stand out! Be someone that lights up everyone‚Äôs day!
One things for certain, you too can take the depression and anxiety  and throw it out, and be happy again! :)"

"

I feel so out-of-place. Ever since I was young I never felt like I belonged anywhere. Neither with friends nor family. I wear different masks to try and fit-in. But I always feel a hole in my heart. I feel uncomfortable and awkward all the time. I feel better when I‚Äôm alone in my room. "
"You don‚Äôt see many of these posts because when people get better they don‚Äôt need to engage with such subs anymore. That‚Äôs a shame because then the only posts you see here are of people deep in the hole and it looks like nobody is getting better.

But that‚Äôs not true, and I‚Äôm posting today for that reason.

OMG, I feel so much better and alive. And gosh I was in such deep, deep and dark, dark hole I never thought I could get out of. Wrong. Depression lies to you a lot‚Ä¶ 

What personally helped me the most (in order of efficiency) was: 
1) Reaching out to friends and the community and having deep conversations with them 
2) Going to therapy 
3) Reading ¬´¬†The Science of Stuck¬†¬ª by Britt Frank.
 
A major advancement in my healing process was also when I stopped getting so stuck in my head trying to analyse and rationalise every thought and listen to my body sensations instead. Work from a more somatic POV. 

You‚Äôll get through this, it really sucks but you‚Äôll be okay.

How can I stop feeling sorry for myself? I wallow in self-pity and I find comfort in it. I've always been somewhat depressed since my teenage years. I'm much older now but now I feel a mixture of depression/regret/anger because my personality/decisions have led me to where I am today so I'm bitter. I'm riddled with shame for not achieving the bare minimum society expects of me. l used to be a NEET. I still feel like I am but technically I'm studying. I have no friends. I feel like I'm so behind and catching up feels impossible. I feel overwhelmed and i feel ashamed to even try to improve because I feel pathetic about the fact that I even have to improve. I don't know what to do. I just want to be happy. What I've already done/know about to try to improve: I already go to the gym. I already take vitamin D supplement. I have a pet. I have a hobby. I can't afford therapy.

Update.  My mom died last night. 

My mom is in hospice with very late stage Parkinson‚Äôs and dementia. She‚Äôs dying. We didn‚Äôt have a good relationship but I love her so much. I underestimated how profound this lose is going to be. I need to know how to do this. Also I‚Äôm autistic. So I‚Äôm really struggling with this. If I even think about it I‚Äôm start sobbing. Is there any way to prepare or a book? I know it‚Äôs stupid. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. Please. Any advice would be great."

"I came back from a trip I went on to see my girlfriend on the fifth of jan.

I have such a huge trash pile in my room that it goes onto my bed but I just can't seem to care. My dad tells me to keep my room clean out of self respect but I just don't respect myself. There's no one to respect, I feel like I don't exist. I want to shower. I'm itchy, and I smell bad, and I'm starting to get acne all over. My body is screaming at me to shower but I just don't see the point. It doesn't feel like it'll change anything. I'll feel empty after my shower too, and the thought just makes me want to go back to sleep and pray for a better tomorrow while knowing it won't come.

"Hey.

First day back on Reddit in awhile.

The holidays were hard.

I'm six months into a new life after losing mostly everything and everyone.

I'm traumatized. Tired. Mentally ill. Depressed.

But I'm doing what I need to do.

I'm resting. I'm eating. I'm med compliant. I'm lifting weights as I can. Getting healthier. Doing some writing. I have a few hobbies. Making new friends.

Developing my relationship with God. Praying. Trying to get into the Word. I have a good church.

House is clean. I'm taking care of myself. Replaced most of my stuff. I'm budgeting. Keeping in contact with family and friends.

But I'm still depressed. Tired. In pain. Exhausted. Mental anguish. Suffering. And every day gets worse.

I can't do everything I want to do today.

But I'm safe. Even in this much pain I accept that life is good, purposeful, and meant to be lived.

I hand each day over to God so I may live.

But it hurts so much now. And has for a long time.

I am doing absolutely everything I can. And if I'm not I'm human.

I mentally acknowledge that I'm blessed. That God has given me everything back I lost, and new people to replace the old. That this may be for a time. But today I suffer.

And I have been for a long time."
"Through 100% my own fault, I‚Äôve lost everything I cared about this year. 

End of my marriage. Loss of a dream career opportunity. Loss of friends. Loss of self respect. 

I‚Äôve made horrible decisions, hurt people I care for and caused a lot of pain. I don‚Äôt seek sympathy for that at all. 

I‚Äôve been putting in all the work I can to grow from this. Therapy, working out, new friends, reconnecting with family, hobbies and spirituality. 

All the things normally recommended. 

It‚Äôs helped to an extent. 

But I sit here on new years so aware of the person I‚Äôve been, how alone I am, and I am so empty. 

I can‚Äôt help but think the world would be better off without me. 

Is there any point going on?"
I keep getting into arguments and banned from subs. Napping didn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm ashamed of myself. I need someone to talk to
"I am so fucking insecure. I really fucking hate myself.  I am really done with myself. I fail in every fucking thing . Moving to a new place i thought everyone will actually accept me as a friend or even an acquaintance . They will see past my failure. But no fucking no . No one fucking no one actually likes me . What's my fault ? I'm always the 1st one to approach people . I'm just standing in a pool of fucking despair , at the same fucking position for the last 4 yrs - a medical aspirant! Not a medical student! My boyfriend is a medical student. I am actually really jealous of him . I know he has put all that hardwork i know he deserves it more than anyone. But I can't i just can't stop being insecure in our relationship . I'm not even extraordinarily pretty , don't have a hot body to show off too . I'm so fucking tired , so fucking tired of everything in this fucking life . I feel exhausted i feel fucked up .
 In the constant circle of self doubt and self hatred , when will I be finally free ? When would the time come that I would be finally happy and confident"
"I got hung up on one thing and kept trying to pursue that thing over and over and in the meantime I didn‚Äôt even enjoy anything around me. I sacrificed a lot of things trying to take these classes and in the end I didn‚Äôt even pass them. I should‚Äôve let go failing from the start and pursued my passion. 

If my mindset were better I wouldn‚Äôt have done that, depression or not imo.

My mindset was so stupid, it resulted in me being depressed. I‚Äôm confused because that wasn‚Äôt my mindset prior. I was very carefree and easy to let things go. Yes I tended to ruminate but I always tried to be happy. With my previous mindset I would‚Äôve just let go of those courses and moved onto something else. 

But now I know what had to be done here and that time is far far gone. I cannot save myself. I‚Äôm very confused and upset.

I can‚Äôt make up for what was lost. What‚Äôs angering is learning the solution was so simple all this time and yet I wasted the potential for my entire college experience. Everything was always in my control. 

Everything finally makes sense now, but makes sense way too late. This is something I should‚Äôve learned naturally. It‚Äôs something I ought to have figured out earlier within maybe a few months, maybe a year. Not years and years of suffering, like literally 4-5 years of suffering. I‚Äôm so confused. What is going on? Why did I have to learn this so late in life, when my degree is gone now, something that was so important to me?"
I‚Äôm at my father‚Äôs for the holiday and it‚Äôs just the two of us. I‚Äôm upstairs crying and I have no desire to cook Christmas dinner tomorrow or even spend the day with him. We‚Äôre at a complete impasse over something incredibly important to me and I have no one to talk to about it. I‚Äôm not explaining this well but I‚Äôm in a lot of mental pain and completely alone. I‚Äôm so angry and hurt and disappointed and I really wish I had a safe shoulder to cry on.
"Its a few hours before christmas. My family and I did a get together an hour earlier than usual since we gotta travel the next day. They always comment on how I always have a resting bitch face and I ruin moods. Well today I didnt have that face but my smile was fake. During a photo taking we were having earlier I could feel how fake my smile is and how am trying my best not to cry. Its so hard to fake a smile yet I have to. I don't want questions or any other stuff since I know what they will and I will jus get judged and belittled. My heart is full of hurt and sadness right now. I pity myself for being this way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have not been in reddit for a while. But since I really don't have anyone to talk to about this, this is where I run. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I know right now is whats happening feels like what happened before. And since the feeling seems familiar my subconcious self is just waiting on it but I can already feel the pain. "
"First things first. I‚Äòm usually more the type of person, who dislikes the holiday season because of annoying family members.

This year was the first christmas I looked forward to since my childhood days, since this year was really, really bad regarding my depression and anxiety.

And now nothing will happen this year, because my grandma hat a stroke and is lying in some kind of emergency room (no visitors allowed)
and the rest of my family is lying in bed bc of covid.

I always wanted to go visit my grandparents more often but never could manage it, even though we live in the same town.
I hate myself so much right now cause I never got my shitty ass over to them. I feel like absolute trash.

I will spend my christmas eve alone in my apartment now in tears and worries that my grandma won‚Äòt make it. 

P.S. sorry if I made mistakes, english is not my first language.
 And thank you everybody who read this. 

Happy holidays to each and everyone here."
"First of all I do to want to promote depression as something good, I dont want anyone to think that.

Long story short, ive been depressed for 8 years, it has destroy me in many ways and affected me and everyone around me. Is just, this weird feeling I get sometimes I dont know how to describe it. When I lay down in bed or sitting in my desk alone, sad as hell, im really relaxed, so relaxed that I wanna continiue stay depressed for some reason. Im really anxious all the time as well so these moments are heaven to me.    

But then, I dont wanna be depressed. If anyone knows  something, please tell me. Does anyone feel the same? I dont wanna be addicted to my depression."
"Hello, i've been struggling to find social contact since corona, got a trauma which made me withdraw, didn't have support have not processed it. Now I have had major health issues as well, don't feel well even in my own bed

"I graduated college. Got a job I actually kind of enjoyed. Quit that job due to sexual harassment. Took a new job. I moved to a new town. And I work from home so meeting new people there wont work. I miss when school forced me to meet people. I‚Äôm so alone here but I have no idea how to meet people. I hate my new job doing data entry but it was all I could get short notice. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life. I‚Äôve been depressed since middle school. Things always seem to get better for a litttle while and then get way worse.

I feel like every time I hit a new milestone I lose everyone."
"Some days, you just stay in bed bc it takes every bit of power in you to stay alive and you can't do anything else.

But other days? Still in the fog, the haze, the nothingness... what do you do?

I'm compiling a list of things that may help me (and possibly others). I'm writing them on a small piece of paper, folding it and pick one per day. I have the entire day to do this one task (or I can pick more if I'm feeling lighter). 

So far, I have- 

Brush teeth (yea, that gets overlooked in my worst)

Wash face ( I do face cleaner, a hydrating cream afterwards, etc).

Cold shower 

Bubble bath (with candles, an audiobook or podcast)

Sit outside on porch 

5 min dance or yoga stretches

Go to the river (it's a good place for me)

5000 step walk

Write/ send someone a snail mail letter

60 seconds in front of mirror saying ""you are worthy of love""

Is there anything else anyone can think of for me to add? This is aside from reaching out to hotlines, therapy, etc."
"If you can't do 30 minutes, you can start with 10 minutes until you get to 30 minutes. Then maybe sitting in sunlight may eventually turn to talking walks in sunlight. 

It's not magic that it will make you feel better right away. But doing it for a few days I kinda feel a bit good after. Not drastically good but slightly  Also slept a few minutes longer. Hopefully there would come a time my sleep is enough.

And I'd just want to mention I'm still on anti depressants. But hopefully I can get off it in a few months."
"Please hang on. It‚Äôs a lie that mental Illness tells you.  It‚Äôs a lie.  Your brain is telling you things that aren‚Äôt true.  When people say it gets better, it‚Äôs not a lie. Even if better is only a little bit. It‚Äôs impossible to see how much different things can be or feel.  If you feel this way. You are absolutely not alone. And those feelings may be comfortable cause they are always there. For days months or years. It‚Äôs so easy to let yourself be immersed in them.  It‚Äôs not your fault. It feels like it must be true cause it doesn‚Äôt change.  Or maybe cause it‚Äôs easier to lean into it than fight it. Which is absolutely true.  Whether it‚Äôs growth or therapy or medication those are all valid options.  Even a an outlet or a kind ear can change everything. I know you couldn‚Äôt possibly fathom the gravity of the loss of you because you feel like nothing or negativity embodied.  Someone, probably more people than you know would rather hear your cries or sit in your silence than sit at your grave. You may not believe me which is fine. But the little joys of life do start feeling more bright and meaningful    The dreams you once had even if it‚Äôs one out of ten of them do come true.  It takes effort to get better which is a monumental task if you are so deep. I know it is I promise I‚Äôve been there.  Any effort is just too much.  I know. I feel you and I‚Äôm so sorry you feel this way. But I am living proof that it‚Äôs possible to recover.   I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm perfect and my world is full of butterflies.  Of course it‚Äôs not.  But I‚Äôve found people that accept me.  And even if they don‚Äôt understand they are there for me.  I‚Äôm Married now and my husband is the epitome of ‚Äúignorance is bliss‚Äù.  He could say ‚Äúoh that sucks. Just don‚Äôt think about it‚Äù kind of guy.  But if I say I‚Äôm sad and don‚Äôt know why. Or crying cause I want to he will be there for a hug and cuddles.  I can tell him my feelings and he will say do you want to talk or be left alone. Do you want advice or just vent.  I have found friends along the way too.  Only one or two lifelong. One from college. And three after I was 25.   They all can either relate or have the sympathy to listen or both. Of course I‚Äôve had horror stories along the way. Longtime friends I‚Äôve cut off or ones who have cut me off or completely fucked me over.   If you‚Äôve read this long I‚Äôm sorry I got into the rambles. And my punctuation is shit I‚Äôm on my phone.   My whole point is life isn‚Äôt perfect.  But it‚Äôs so worth living      It‚Äôs not a fairytale but growing yourself and evolving it is possible   It‚Äôs hard to see or feel.  But please take every win. Every good encounter or nice weather day. Every perfect leaf you find. Every lucky penny.  Every all green light drive.  You could think no one will miss you.  Or you‚Äôve done enough.  Or maybe no one will care. But i promise I will.   (For context I attempted multiple times, was in therapy and on medication from 9yo to about 19yo for self harm anxiety depression. I‚Äôm now 30 married with home, dog, son, rabbit). Maybe no one will see this. Idk how Reddit works too much I‚Äôm new.  Hopefully someone will see this    Thanks anyone for reading"

"I [26 M] don't have much to complain about. I just finished school, have plenty in savings, and am making good money at my new job.

However, I have three insecurities that are eating me alive.

The first is that I'm just now at the point where many people my age were 3-4 years ago in terms of graduating college, having a career, etc.

I seethe at the thought of knowing people who were 18 five years ago have already graduated and been working for a year and a half, while I am just now starting.

The second is that I have no life skills.

My family didn't have the patience to teach me anything besides how to drive a car, so I don't feel like I know how to do a third of what an adult should.

Lastly, I have very little social life.

Regretfully, I got sucked into cult-like Christianity about five years ago, which made me lose a lot of friends, refuse to make new ones because of my radical beliefs, and miss out on a lot of fun as a result. Now that I'm starting to come to my senses, I'm left with only a small remnant of friends who didn't mind that I went off the deep end. However, they don't always want to hang out.

I keep thinking about these things every day, and it kills me inside."

"My boyfriend has depression and lately it is getting worse and worse. 

For example, he has started having problems getting out of bed or maintaining personal hygiene.  I also feel that he is becoming more and more pessimistic and has less and less self-esteem.

All this doesn't bother me, I love him. But I want to know what I can do to help him feel better. 

At the moment he doesn't want to go to a psychologist and I don't want to pressure him to do so, it has to be his own decision. So I'm writing him positive notes because they cheer him up a bit and every time he feels he can't take a shower I offer to take a shower together to help him.

What else can I do to help him?"
"Making friends is too hard, I feel unwanted. I can never get on top. I'm so stuck in my mental illness that I'm starting to think I'll never get out of this.

I just want to be alone in my room every day. I want to sleep. No one wants me and I don't know how to be wanted."
"The depression ebbs and flows.  Today it flowed. It hit me so hard I thought I was allergic to something because I was struggling to breathe (spoiler: I‚Äôm not). ‚ÄúHelp.‚Äù I want to scream. But no one is listening.  My friends have no idea I‚Äôm in this hole. My family has no idea I‚Äôm in this hole. The mask has gotten so good that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to convince them of the severity if I tried. It would look worse than attention-seeking. It would look pity-seeking.

I don‚Äôt even know what they could do to help if they wanted to. This isn‚Äôt a cheer me up situation.  This is an endless loop of dread and anhedonia. I feel helpless then hopeless on a 90 minute cycle.  It hasn‚Äôt gotten better in months.  It‚Äôs only gotten worse.  Is this the spiral they talk about?

What if when I get there I don‚Äôt bounce?"

"My depression skyrocketed in the past few months and with it I feel like I have lost the ability to feel  ‚Äúlove‚Äù. 

This applies to my girlfriend, my dog, my family, friends, I just don‚Äôt feel love towards them, I mostly feel numb, despite having a good relationship. It is hard to feel excitement as well. 

Before no matter how stressed I was I felt surging love for my gf, dog, and usually family and friends. I was excited about stuff. Now that‚Äôs gone. Logically I know I love them, but no feeling. 


My libido has also suffered as I am just not getting mentally aroused as I did before (physically things work fine, but outside of actively having sex I feel sexually numb, before I was always horny even when depressed). Is this normal for depression? I have gotten hormones checked all normal. 28 male. "
"(NSFW because self harm, starving and suicidal thoughts)

Even harming myself and starving myself only does so much, i never feel happy truly, even if i smile, in a second it just drops, my facial expression goes back to blank in a flash.

Due to such limitations, I would hyper focus on self improvement, skill building, and hobbies. Eventually the hobbies would burn out, and I was often left staring at my ceiling. When I tuned 18, I left for college with new hopes of creating my life. I joined communities, explored classes, and traveled to the city. 

Unfortunately, this was the first time I could apply the skills I taught myself and things didn't go as planned. I never found any friends, never found enjoyment in the things I did, never figured out what I wanted to do with my life, and I failed college. Covid happened and I back home I wentüò•. 

But I couldn't give up. I decided to focus on 1-2 things. My career and building relationships. In 2021, when places started opening back up, I began hosting volunteer events, attending meetups, bumble BFF, and continued going out alone. For my career, I got accepted to a software engineering apprenticeship.

Sounds promising right? Unfortunately, the only people I met were a-holes, and miserable people. I still haven't found fulfillment in any activities. This was extremely inconsistent due to my environment, my mom, and lack of finance. Not even enough money for transportation. And by the time I earned enough skills and experience to earn 100k+ entry job, the tech industry blew up. Again, despite my best efforts, I spent too much time in my head alone, talking to the walls.

Fasting forward, our house burned down with terrible insurance, haven't had a job in 1.5 years, spirituality abandoned me, credit went from 760 to 550, left the country broke and alone, returned to U.S. started using social media.

Still I haven't given up. but again I'm so done with everything. Endless efforts and no results. I've been doing my best to enjoy and focus on the little things, stay present in the moment, eating the best I can and getting movement in. I'm reading ' High Magick' by Damien echols. I'm still puting in job applications and brain storming ideas on what to do next, taking smaller steps, but I'm so over everything.

 I have no car, no friends, no job, no passion, no enjoyment, no change in my pocket. I share a room and bed with my mom. I'm tired of taking walks, reading countless books, doing everything alone. I've learned to enjoy my own company, and I'm forever grateful for the independence and power it gave me, but I'm ready to focus on more things that are not myself.

The only reason I've made it this far is because I believe in myself. I believe that there are good things out there for me and that I'm capable of achieving them. I'm doing it for my inner kid that never got her childhood, for my heart that's never known freedom. 

However, this is not sustainable and I'm deeply struggling and completely lost. I can't keep staring at the walls, but at this point nothing seems to be better. I finally reach a point where I want to live, but I feel that slipping away again..."
"If so, are you glad you didn't give up? And what advice can you give to people who have lost hope and want to end it all?"
"i just have no motivation to do self care (most of the time bc i think it doesnt make a difference) but at this point im actually excited to take a shower and stuff bc i know it makes a massive difference rn. the issue is when im excited about things i postpone them bc i have this expectation in my head that it will be so much fun and that i will appreciate the moment but its almost never as fun in real life as i imagine it to be so i keep on procrastinating it to get the perfect moment to do it so i can get the most out of it.
this is such a toxic habit tho and i really want to get rid of it."
"I just don't want to be without a companion forever. And I keep seeing people bitch and moan about being single in their 20s. Everyone gives them reassurance that they're ""still young"" and ""don't worry"". I turn 33 in February, am I still young too? Am I past the point of trying to find someone to give a fuck about me? Or should I just give up? I just want hope that these spring chickens in their 20s are getting. I just want someone to fucking care about me."
"I want to enjoy these things like I used to, but doing them now feels like a chore, and I feel very drained afterwards. I'm worried that if I keep forcing myself to do them, I will start to hate them. Does anyone have any solutions for this? "
"I (29m) have dealt with depression on and off for the majority of my life. Outwardly, I would mostly seem to have it all together. I own a home, have a dog who I care deeply for, have a reasonably supportive family and friends, make good money at a solid career, am at least average looking, exercise regulary, and am fairly intelligent and with decent social skills. Despite all of this, I still feel disconnected from everyone around me and the world as a whole.
Beginning in my teenage years, I have developed a sense that no one else quite ""gets"" me. My therapist who i have visited for better than 2 years now weekly, attributes this to me having a particularly high IQ.

I dont say any of this with the intention of humble bragging, but rather to accentuate the issue. I don't feel like I'm getting enough out of life. About 6 months ago, I went through a breakup with my long term SO, which did not cause my depression but rather aggravated it to the point where now life feels like it isn't worth living. I truly don't believe that she was ""the one"" but that having someone in my daily life who cared enough to stick around was good enough.

Since then, I have been emotionally volatile, feel chronically low on energy, am acutely sensitive to negative stimuli, have increasingly large amounts of negative self talk and SI, and more than anything else, am lonelier than ever before. My hobbies just feel like escapism rather than a solution. My productivity at work is much worse, and it feels like an enormous amount of effort to perform the upkeep that comes with owning a home and pet. I manage to perform all the necessary steps most days but everything feels like I am just checking a box, but not actually getting any fulfillment or making progress in any way. 

I believe i have tried to get better. As I mentioned earlier, I attend therapy weekly. I have made lifestyle changes by eating healthier, given up smoking weed which I used as a crutch for years, cut back my drinking to 2 days a week or less, stayed active, made plans with friends, attempted to maintain a positive mindset when possible, and have spent hours reading philosophy and self help material to try to obtain the missing piece that I am hoping will turn things around.

Thus far the only clear avenues I have not pursued are medication (which did not help me during college when I was in a similar situation) and getting involved with more regular group activities. I don't know how much longer I can keep putting in the effort and not feeling like I am getting what I need in return. I am usually thankful for what I have, but when I start feeling poorly, those emotions feel all consuming and drown out any sense of appreciation. Mindfulness exercises only provide fleeting relief and then the darkness comes flooding back in. I am desperately afraid of making an irreversible mistake and devastating those around me.

Any thoughts or conversation would be deeply meaningful to me, and thank you just for reading this if you made it all the way through."
"I just want to disappear. nothing is going well. my partner and I haven't been getting along for months. he's distant, distracted, and snippy. I've had to take a big step back in our relationship so I don't bother him. he gets irritated easily. I have been keeping to myself, and focusing on the house and kids to make up for the fact that he supports us, and don't ask for anything. 

I listen to him and ask about his day. he doesn't ask about me. if he notices I'm sad he tells me to get over it. it's been hard to share the same spaces. I feel embarrassed and ashamed. 

I know he's stressed out too- so I do my best to take the load off. it's not enough. the kids are older (14, 18, 20). I talk to them about helping me out (please put things back, clean up your mess, etc) but it doesn't stick. 18 takes everything personally, and will get upset. they complain about everything. they say they can't do things because they're in too much pain. the doctors can't find anything wrong. it comes and goes it seems.

I haven't worked for almost 2 years. I had a crisis, and put myself in the hospital. tried to work after that, but couldn't. I've developed a neurological disorder- my body moves funny in ways I can't control. It won't get better. I am applying for disability. its not fast.

I have medicine to help. it helps some. my partner agreed I shouldn't work. he promised me we'd be ok on his income. I have an Etsy shop. things can be hard. I think he resents me now.

I don't have any close friends. my family knows about my condition, but since the medicine helps, they forget. everything hurts, but my heart hurts the most.

my therapist asked: *do you like yourself?*

I do. I didn't always. but I really do. I don't think my family does, and certainly not my partner. I don't sleep much, and I've lost so much weight you can see my ribs. no one else knows this since I wear baggy clothes.

I want to go away. I'm so, so sad. I finally slept about 18 hours. I'm considering making myself go back to sleep so I don't have to be awake in this sadness.

üß° sending love to everyone here, and thank you for reading."

Hello.
You don‚Äôt know me, and I don‚Äôt know you. And that‚Äôs okay. Whatever you‚Äôre going through, it will pass. The clouds will go, and the sun will shine. All in due time.
Put the pills down, drop the rope, and take a moment to read. And listen to the words I preach.

I‚Äôm young. Younger than most of you, that for one is true. I‚Äôve always been depressed, for as long as I remember, I wanted to disappear. I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt feel it now. You‚Äôre not alone.
The physical strain on the body, waking up in the morning and wishing you hadn‚Äôt, feeling heavy and exhausted no matter how much rest you get. And feeling undeniably, and uncomfortably numb. Cold. Alone. 
It feels like the end, I know it does. But I promise you, you‚Äôre strong. You‚Äôve lasted this long, fought so hard. You can keep going. I know you can. 

June 6th 2024, I lost my best friend. He took his life from an overdose and was pronounced dead in his bedroom. His mother messaged me June 24th 2024 to share the news. I didn‚Äôt believe it. I thought ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a silly kid he‚Äôs got to be lying‚Äù but he wasn‚Äôt. None the less I pushed it off and joked with my friends. Tried to make light of the situation. Then July 4th 2024, his mother sent another messaged. 

‚ÄúHi once again dear, it was Xavier‚Äôs funeral today. His football team was there and so was Levi. It was a lovely service and they really did take care of him. Thank you for all you‚Äôve done and all the kind words you‚Äôve sent his way. Xavier would be proud of you, like he always said. Good luck with your football and school work, remember Xav is at rest now and he‚Äôs no longer hurting. Sometimes these things are for the better. I‚Äôll be deleting the account now, so I will no longer be reached. Thank you Vesper xx‚Äù

That‚Äôs when it hit me. That woman had lost her son. Her 17 year old boy. And she‚Äôs never going to see him again.

Pain is inevitable.

‚ÄúSuicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. If you‚Äôre that depressed, talk to somebody.‚Äù 
-Robin Williams

You‚Äôll be okay.

People will feel the pain. Xavier was a good friend. I hadn‚Äôt spoken to him much in the running to weeks as he was doing A-level exams and I was doing mock exams. He lived hours away and was unreachable most days. 

My point is. People will miss you. When you‚Äôre dark and alone, you feel like no one will care. But people will. You‚Äôre somebodies best friend, someone‚Äôs rock, someone‚Äôs child, someone‚Äôs role model and someone‚Äôs love. The pain is transferable. And although Suicide is an easier way out of a life that has treated you badly, it isn‚Äôt the only option. 

Talk to someone.

Speak out.


You‚Äôre loved.
Appreciated.
Beautiful.
Handsome.
Validated.
Cared.
Important.

And you are relevant.

If you‚Äôre in immediate danger, call your countries emergency service number.

Rest in peace Xavier. Gone too soon. Too far. I‚Äôll be with you someday, until then. I love you. Forever and always, like we used to say. I‚Äôll help people in memory of you. My boy. My love. My life. Thank you.

"And that really doesnt make me love him more.

I bought myself a pretty house in a little village. I have fields in front if it with goats and sheep. I wanted to rescue animals. And grow vegetables, and make goats cheese...And give all that to associations... my dream..

¬†But I can't do anything. I can't move. I'm desperate and so alone. I'm unable to go talk to people. Anxiety is like a huge fear that lasts inside me all the time 

I want to give up. I'm so tired... I tried everything there is in therapy and medication for more than 20 years now.

I feel like if I don't feel better in a context where there is everything I wanted. Than it just won't happen. That not a life. That's not a way to go through life. I need relief sometimes. 

(Also I don't know why I have this pseudo. I'm new and I didn't choose it.)"
"Sometimes whenever I vent, I feel guilty because others have it way worse. I wonder if my trauma is good enough to cry about, maybe not because I am an attention seeking brat who gets whatever she wants... "
"I'm visiting my mom now not because I miss her but because I have to, she's extremely ill but every time we talk she triggers the abuse and neglect memories and it kills me.
Then she lectures me on forgiveness (she means to forgive the f*cker she married and had me).

How can I not get triggerd by her ? because I can't take it anymore."
"I‚Äôve never told anyone this, not my parents, family, friends, no one, but I have a porn addiction, and it‚Äôs caused me to become depressed, lost, and lonely, even suicidal thoughts. This might scare you but it started when I was 5, and it just spiraled down from there, It got to a point when I beat it almost 10 times a day, honestly, I know where my dad‚Äôs gun is and how to load and use it, if someone can just help me find a reason to move on and live, then please send it, I need help and I know it
Edit: sorry if not much, like I said, never told anyone and 14"
I just want to talk to someone. Anyone. I feel like shit and i did some bad things last night. I feel totally hopeless. I dont want to die like this
"few days ago i opened up from my mom about my depression it took everything from me to explain to her what im feeling and all she could just say is "" forget how you feel, and just be happy "" i got so frustrated at her that i screamed at her "" how? ,if it was that simple do you think i would choose to feel this way ""....am i the bad guy to feel like this ?"
"Either it's because of antidepressants, or depression itself,  well  lack of libido will be there. At least for me.  But I'm in a 2 years relationship, we live together, and we're planning a future together. But this lack of libido on my side is ruining everything. 

Those in a committed relationship, how do you handle this? Do you just have sex without feeling much? Do you make up a scene and act it out like you're horny? Do you simply don't have sex and have a difficult and frustrating relationship? 

The thing that annoys me the most is all other aspects are so positive. We laugh together, we're honest with each other, we respect each other, there's communication, there's common goals and values... But the lack of sexuality is really making things so worse. He's frustrated and I'm anxious and feeling guilty."
"Please someone fucking help me, I wanna kill myself. "
If u want in the comments then do so or just hit me up I wanna help to make sure no one goes through what I did
"I have old parents. i love them so much and when they pass, I don't think I'll be able to keep going with my life. I'm the youngest, so I'm probably gonna watch my whole family pass away, I'm gonna have to attend every funeral  and deal with the pain of losing them.

not to mention the fact my dog is getting older, wtf am I meant to do then???? I'm considering just ending it now before i have to go through the pain of losing them, I know it's really selfish, but i just don't know. im only 14 years old."
I (21m) have no idea what to do. I start therapy next week but I just don‚Äôt know how to handle my emotions. I feel a deep pit in my stomach and I don‚Äôt see a way out. I can‚Äôt be suicidal because it would destroy my mom but I can‚Äôt think of anything that would make my life worth living. I would really appreciate it if anyone had any ideas on how I can stop suffering
"

All my life I had anxiety, but depression and suicide thoughts come to me last year and it was harsh. But after one year, and after max dose od sertraline 200mg, and TMS sessions I got remission, but I haave this cursed diagnose: BPD, and 4 mounths ago girlfriend broke up with me after 1 year and 3 mounths, I still ssuffering from that. It is hard for me to keep working and studying for college. I am up to fifth year of college (ancient history), and I work in museum. I play bass guitar. I write songs. But deep down my heart is broken, the person I was fighting for left me. In my family tree the uncle comitted suicide and it is following me now, and I think I can not escape it. Some advice, please, bc I can not open about this to my friends, they wouldnt get it."
"I should be happy. My life is where i want it to be. Why the fuck cant i just be happy? i cant even think of anything that can bring me any happiness anymore. I just randomly think about suicide even though i dont want to. If i didnt have my cat i honestly think i wouldve done it already just to get some peace. In the US so cant even afford therapy

I was about to post this on the depression subreddit but found out im banned? thats actually hilarious "
"Title basically says it all. 

I didn't think it was depression. I haven't been feeling particularly negative towards myself. I'm not suicidal! There's stuff I'd be doing if I could. I wouldn't say life feels hopeless like in my past depression episodes. 

But I can't seem to make myself DO anything! I just spent an hour watching some plant shadows moving about on the wall.

I've forced myself to eat. I've forced myself to hydrate. I've kept up with my meds. I scrubbed the crap outta myself in the shower.

I've had some wins today, but like...

Is there some hack I'm missing to get some energy back? I just want to go back to my normal life..."
"I want to die. I always have ever since I can remember. I feel like I'm enough for myself but I don't feel like enough in other peoples lives. I struggle every day staying alive but I go at each day with as much positive energy as I can not for me but for those around me. If I died tomorrow I wouldn't care until I remembered I have people who care, people who want to hear my voice, people who who want me. I find that those people keep me going because if it were just me I would not see tomorrow.

I love to help people even if I'm at my lowest but I find it really difficult to keep going and recently its gotten really hard making me think about ending it even with all those people. I hear all their happy moments and when they ask me about mine I have to say I don't have any even with the positivity I still struggle. They tell me time heals all but I don't know how much more time I can give. I feel alone most days but I try to keep up with them I know I'm not alone and you aren't either I love myself and even more important I love you I may not know you but trust me I do. I ask myself every day ""What did I do wrong today?"" The answer is nothing We're just being ourselves we make mistakes but those mistakes teach us a lot if we let it.

I hope to find my person one day but I feel bad that they have to deal with all my weird. I love my weird moments I love being alive yet I still struggle to keep going. If you are struggling tell someone anyone I promise it will get better from one struggling person to the next please keep going if not for others then do it for yourself. Someone will answer. You got this"
"Hatred for myself for how im treating this hatred fort the ones responsable of my misery those who destroyed my life hatred for those who abandoned me. 
I have been in this situation for almost 6 years now since i leaved my country due to its terrible situation and i havent trully felt fine in a while add it the covid shit and all went into a hellhole i fronting economical issues i might not be able to finish my studies and i just feel hopeless and that became hate"
"My life has been good on and of until I was born up til I turned 25 after I turned 25 everyone is in a bad mood screaming and yelling at me or someone else. After I turned 25 my life been good for a few months and it got bad again.

4 years ago it got worse my mom passed everyone stopped talking to me and treated me bad and I was alone and lonely and have nothing but bad luck . And my next to the oldest brother blame me for my mother's passing.

My pet went missing and I never saw her again and I get another pet until I get my own place. I can't find a job and my other brother is lecture me think I am not trying yes everything is going wrong and I keep thinking about suicide and ending my life and jumping in the lake I have nothing but bad luck. I am very angry and stressed no not at nobody the way things are.  

I feel like a loser I hate this I have been looking for a job for a very long time and nobody wants to hire me.  My family is gaslighting me saying I am not trying to get a job and jobs are out there. I feel like I am far behind.

Check on the people that still seem to smile despite what they go through. Ask them if they‚Äôre really okay. Give them a hug. Don‚Äôt just tell them how strong they are. They can only be strong for so long and it makes for silent breakdowns and an unfathomable feeling of loneliness. So really check on the people you are constantly telling ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so strong‚Äù. Because we are not and some of us haven‚Äôt been okay for a long time. I‚Äôm so fucking tired. Don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs always the ones gone too soon, by their own hand, that we are always asking the same question. They seemed so happy, how could they? "

Does therapy even help when people are this low?"
I dont want ti think anymore. I want to die. I dint want to go to school anymore. I dont want to be a adult. I just want to disapear
"I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening to me, but I can‚Äôt do anything at all except sleep and eat. I feel insignificant because I don‚Äôt do anything, but I can‚Äôt do anything either. What should I do?"
"I just don‚Äôt know what else to do. My cries for help aren‚Äôt being heard anywhere. Every day is bad and god is out to get me. He likes to leave me to suffer. Every day is just agony and I need someone to hear me. My life has been a downward spiral for months. Starting with the breakup between me and my ex which still hurt 7 months later. I try so hard to move on but it always just hurts. I miss her so much and I just always think if I just wasn‚Äôt the person I am maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have been so dumb maybe she‚Äôd still be here. I‚Äôm going off to the army now but truthfully I didn‚Äôt want this life. I wanted to be with her in school still, but I ran after we broke up because I was scared. Running didn‚Äôt help and I‚Äôm still hurting. I can‚Äôt reach out now I don‚Äôt have any way to contact her and I doubt she‚Äôd want to talk to me now. 

Every time I have hope it just gets ripped from me. Every time I‚Äôm talking to someone new or I‚Äôm hoping for something or anything like that it just always goes bad. People leave me for no reason. I just can‚Äôt have a good thing

Speaking back on the army, I have to go to fat camp, because of all the weight I gained during the breakup. So that‚Äôs fun. Just another way to get ridiculed I guess. I stopped eating so much since I‚Äôm on a time crunch. I barely eat now. I can‚Äôt be at that place long

Also speaking on the army is my job. I can‚Äôt find any info on it. It seems to be a bad job too. When you‚Äôre in this fat loss program you don‚Äôt get a large amount of jobs to choose from like if you were normal. So that‚Äôs fun too, guess I‚Äôll suffer this way too. The army doesn‚Äôt even pay much and I don‚Äôt wanna do college again, but everyone demands a degree in this day and age because why the fuck not

The only thing that calms me down is porn, because I‚Äôm a porn addict and I lied. I lied to everyone saying I don‚Äôt do this and I judge all the sex workers I see and all the people who are open about it and I‚Äôm worse, I‚Äôm worse than them I‚Äôm worse than everybody. 

Social media definitely doesn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm watching the fall of society while my life collapses too

I‚Äôm in so much pain. Not enough pain to be grouped in with the people who need real help like the homeless and stuff like that, but I‚Äôm also not okay enough to keep going on like this. And my cried just always fall on deaf ears, nobody understands me. It hurts to watch other people succeed. Why does god give my enemies so much joy and happiness. Why does he allow bad people to live great lives. I put forth an honest effort daily but no matter what I get thrown for a loop. Every day is just silent suffering and it‚Äôs been this way for as long as I can remember 

And I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not even everything. But it‚Äôs all I can think of now, idk my head hurts from crying I can‚Äôt think straight. 

Someone please say something, please tell me anything that might help, it doesn‚Äôt matter what, I just don‚Äôt want my cries to fall on deaf ears again"

I want what almost everyone here wants. Just to be heard and understood.  I don't want the solutions and advice that so many of us are aware of, and either tried already or just won't do it. 

There's no response to what I'm saying that could be an answer. 

I have dealt with depression, anxiety, trauma and more my whole life.

Only now have I felt the sensation as if my spirit is truly weak, tired and fading. 

I've fought long and hard for myself and others and have gotten so little progress and so little reciprocation from the people I love. 

I'd never have the balls to kill myself, but every moment is torture. 

I'm 40. My functions In almost all ways have declined and the world just expects me to try harder. 

It's truly unbelievable how cold and thoughtless most mental health treatments are. 

Lazy thinking assholes diagnose us and never understand what home life or reality is like and if you live in a shit environment, you get told you have a disorder, not that your surroundings are shit.

They did it to me at 15. Hand ya pills and send ya packing.  Pay no mind to an alcoholic father and batshit mother both being abusive and neglectful, lucky some overpaid graduate stepped in and said I have a disorder and gave me Paxil. 

Real awesome job. 

So yea... Everything is bullshit

I see others who say such ""genius"" things and feel like ""why is it that I never think such things?"". I have never had good friends. They are the sort of people who would betray you in the last moment. I am sort of close with my brother, but even he makes fun of how dumb I am because I don't understand things easily. I and my mother have a terrible relationship. My father passed away recently, whom I miss a lot. We both were similar in so many aspects, and it always felt like my mom and brother team up against us. Initially I thought I was the only one who felt like that, but later, my dad also told that he felt the same. I feel like I've got the worst traits of my parents and my brother, luckily got the best ones. I feel like I'm the sort of person whom no one would want to be around.

I havent felt any sliver of happiness ever sence nothing makes me happy anymore. I keep lying to myself that im ok but im not im hurting so much on the inside i cant keep doing this. I just want to be happy again. She was that 1 person and i fucked it up, i dont think anyone will ever love me again she was 1 of a kind. I just want to cuddle and kiss her again but ill never get that chance again. I dont want to die alone but idk how long i can push through to find someone before that happens"
"I'm 18M , currently in college and I think I am depressed (or at least v sad). i have good parents, i am comfortable in life but I'm still sad a lot of the time. Im failing in all aspects of my life. I broke up w my gf a year back, took a long time to recover from that and since then i have been ghosted by every girl i have approached. I am not succeeding professionally much, I have practically wasted the entire summer without a single thing to show for it. All my friends are doing so much great work and being absolutely awesome at everything while I suck at everything. I think i am an absolute loser who does not even deserve to live. I do sometimes feel good and like things are going my way but then one thing does not and i just breakdown completely I feel like crying, screaming, and sometimes unaliving myself. I don't know what to do and I thought of posting here just to get some advice."
"Just wanted to like...ask something. I was diagnosed with dysthymia or persistent depressive disorder. And when I like explain and tell someone about it, they argue back that they also have depression but high functioning depression. And I'm like, okay? We all have our struggles. Depression have different faces and looks. We can't experience the same depression. It confuses me, because there's already two people that tried to argue that to me as if wanted to tell me I'm faking it? Idk. Idk. What do you guys think? Did I not seem 'depressed' enough to them? I explained it badly to them? Or am I the asshole for not seeing them depressed as well? This is really confusing."
"Why do you live? I mean, the more you grow up, the more responsibilities you have.
I am 19 years old and I have no dreams, I am scared to ""die"" at 25 and being buried at 75.
Once I grow up, I won't have my friends anymore, because most likely we are going to take different paths.
So why should I live if all these good/happy things are going to become sadness one day"
I can really use an answer right now-
"There's nothing good about me. I fuck everything in my life up. I have no self worth or self esteem. I'm anxious all the time. I'm bipolar and haven't even figured anything in my life out. I'll never get married because I'm a 33 year old retarded virgin who suffered priapism. No one will want that. Life sucks in general and I'm at the god damn point of bot caring what happens to me. If I wanna drink a lot and see what happens I'm going to. I'll make really bad. Sometimes harmful, decisions and if I don't die then fuck it there's always tomorrow to die. FUCK EVERYTHING."

"When I think about my past I'm thankful. Every decision I made, right or wrong, led me to where I am today. 
""If I knew then what I know now I would be a better person today. I'd be a better son, a better brother, a better husband, a better father and a better friend.""
It's easy to convince myself that this statement is true. But when I get into my thoughts, just like we all do every now and then, I realize that this person staring at me in the mirror was shaped from the decisions I made, right or wrong. I am who I am today only because I didn't know then what I know now. 
That being said, I will be a better person tomorrow because I don't know now what I will know tomorrow. I will no longer beat myself up over what I should've, could've, would've done. The reflection on the mirror is better than they were yesterday. And tomorrow I will be better than I am today. "

I struggled with depression my whole life. Ups and downs, depending on life circumstances. Right now it‚Äôs getting a little tough for me again. 

I‚Äôm at home right now and just switching between crying and feeling numb and I can‚Äôt do anything. Can‚Äôt get out of bed. It sucks. 

Normally I would talk to my partner, but he‚Äôs at work and I‚Äôm alone. I only have 1 friend, but he is busy today and yeah‚Ä¶ family is not an option.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Any help? Ideas? How do you get out of this spiral? I know getting up and talking a walk or literally doing anything would help‚Ä¶ I just feel like I physically can‚Äôt. Please I just need someone to talk to right now.

"does anybody else feel like their depression is s‚Ä¶ unjustified?

i keep telling myself ‚Äòyou go to a good university, you‚Äôve got a loving family, you‚Äôve got a supportive partner, and you‚Äôve got a job, what more could you want?‚Äô 

but as i count my blessings, the only thing in my mind is ‚Äòyou‚Äôre doing bad at uni, your family want you to move out, your partner is sick of your whining, your job isn‚Äôt gratifying and you don‚Äôt work enough hours‚Äô. 
and on top of all of that, every single one of my dreams has fallen through, and also all the tiny little aspirations (rejected from military, can‚Äôt find anywhere to live, not getting the jobs i really want, not being selected for anything i apply to).

and beyond all of that, i just feel stupid on a much larger level, because people are dying and starving and losing their family and their homes and I am so privileged to live in the UK and have my loved ones safe, and I even went to a really good private school and don‚Äôt struggle with money cause my parents always help me out. 

ultimately, i feel really guilty for being so sad all the time. i have this wonderful life and i really try to be grateful for that, but i just can‚Äôt be happy for some reason. it just feels like sadness has followed me my whole life, and despite nothing being terribly wrong, i just can‚Äôt shake it. 

anybody else feel guilty and selfish for being depressed? "
I want to take a break from social media and from the people in there but it's just sometime and i go back like nothing happened it's annoying that I can't control myself any advice to stop checking on my social (I already deleted them but ended up downloading it again) &gt;&lt;
"It's been about a year now of tweaking and tuning medication and dosage. A few months ago, I felt a brief moment of sincere happiness. It wasn't forced; it wasn't faked; it was less than a minute, but it was genuine happiness... and it had been a really long time since I had felt that. Being as brief as it was, I didn't want to get my hopes up. Maybe it was just the medication talking, or something similar.

This past month, however, I have noticed more of it. Genuine laughter at jokes or situations; choosing to go do more activities; not feeling pained by doing tasks or chores. But most of all, this past week, I caught myself enjoying a TV show. It's a show that I used to watch occasionally while it was being aired - in the years before. But when I tried watching it as a pick-me-up a couple years ago, I got no enjoyment from it. This past week I gave it another try, and ended up really enjoying myself.

It's an odd feeling ... to get -feeling- back, and it's hard to trust that I'm not just faking so well that even I began believing the lie. But I remember being happy, I remember forcing happy, I remember not feeling... and this is real happiness returning.

It has been a Rollercoaster of a time, finding the medicine that makes it better - not worse. Then adjusting the dosage so I'm not just a glamorous coke-head, but also not a zombie. But it's been worth it. And I'm looking forward to coming further out of the dark."
"Anyone else have this thing where everything they do just... fails? Or there always appears an insurmountable roadblock? Like for example some time ago I got into forgery but after two ""sessions"" the smithing furnace, or whatever you want to call it, broke, but that's not all because now, just as I started to gather the energy to finally get to fixing it I learn that it's made of an alloy that is particularly hard to weld, and that's basically what happens with everything I do, there's always something that stops me from doing anything ""good"", even the small things."
"Last year I lost my wife and the love of my life and I lost the will to live. I was suicidal so I ended up 3 months in a mental health institution. Now I feel much better, but I have to go to a mental institution 4 hours during the day, and when I'm done I can't be alone, I have therapeutic companions that are with me all day and all night. I just want my life back, my independence back and my freedom back. Not being free is making me super depressed. I just needed to vent, thank you very much."

"Hey everyone,

Those last days, I'm really sad and just seems like I'm losing my everything. I'm someone rather cheerful normally, always smiling and just enjoying life but those last days, I surprise myself being very cold w people I used to love talking/chatting with. 

I can't really go outside where I want but when I do, I go to see some mates I know, we have a good laugh together and when we go back home, I feel so lonely.

When I turn my phone on, there is nobody texting me. Not even some ''hey, how are you? Long time no text"" and when I post some story crying or saying I'm not ok, there is nobody texting me to enquire about my feelings or the situation (which is rather hard at the moment).

I find myself loosing interest in every thing I used to love, I just stand there the whole day on my phone, doing nothing at all. Going to sleep. Waking up. No text, nothing. Watching movies. Sleep. And this since a couple months. Every time I be like ''ok let's do some things'' and I just can't do one single thing.

I'm so tired of being like this, I don't know how to get out of this terrible mood, how to be happy even if nobody cares about me... It's just so hard to be orphan sometimes. And just so hard to realise that all ppl you care about don't put the same amount of efforts than you... Not that I wasn't used to it but that it makes me even sadder than ever. Now that I have nothing to do. 

Even when I'll say I'm going for a walk or something, I'll be happy for the day and then face to face to this horrible loneliness. It's killing me so badly. Before I had put my all into studying just not to think about this loneliness and finally succeeded for some months not to feel it but now, it's just as bas as it was. 

I didn't have a lot of chance with love but that's ok. But I also don't have a lot of chance with friends nor family... Nor life actually. But I'm still trying to keep the head up.... 

I wish I had someone who genuinely cared about me as much as I care for others, and not just for some months but all the time. It just feels like I don't deserve to be happy..."
"It feels like in an episode I know exactly why I am depressed. Why I am the worst, etc. And it makes sense in that moment (also, if I write it down during, it mostly makes sense after the episode too)! But after the episode, I just can‚Äôt remember. As if my brain just erased all memory of what I was thinking during the episode. Do you have that too?"
"I'm sorry, I wasn't sure which flair to use ,Requesting Support or Requesting Advice. If I used the wrong one, I'm sorry.

I've been feeling kinda... empty, I guess would be the word. Don't really have friends or anyone to hang out with outside of work, I don't have any ambitions or dreams for the future. I get up, go to work, and go home hide in games and anime until bedtime. I don't really sleep much (I tend to pull all nighters almost every night because if I stop playing to go to bed, I'll be left alone with my thoughts. As a result, I only get a couple hours of sleep every night.) But I also struggle to find motivation to do anything. Dunno where to start in looking for friends, my job is a dead end with less hours than I'd like, I don't even really have any hobbies and I don't know how to start. I used to love games, but now not so much. They became just a way to distract myself. I can't afford therapy or anything, and I know my parents won't take me seriously, so I cant trust them with this. I want to do SOMETHING. Anything to make my life mean something, but it feels pointless. It feels meaningless. As it is, I'm just drifting and waiting to eventually die. And with my habits, it will probably come sooner than later. It really just feels like I've completely given up, and I don't feel like there's anything I can do about it. i mean, its not like i want to die or anything. im too much of a coward for that. i just cant bring myself to live right. I guess right now I'm just looking for something that I can do with lower motivation or strength of will that can at least start helping me along the way of feeling better. Something that can finally motivate me to get off my ass and fix this empty feeling somehow. I need a starting point, cuz I can't count on my parents to help me."
"Today is my birthday - 38th birthday to be exact. It's raining and storming outside, inside my home is deadly silent and at the core of my mind I feel like I'm dying on the inside. I just want to cry, I feel so alone and hopeless. Exercise, therapy and antidepressants do nothing to make me feel better. I pray to the Lord above and I feel like he's not hearing me. What do I do? I just want to feel ""normal"" again. 

Once upon a time I was happy and I remember what that felt like. It all feels like a dream now that's long gone. I just miss being happy. "

"this is the last sub-reddit i could think of, please help.

im 13 and never got into the habit of brushing my teeth.
i know its gross but i genuinely feel like i cant help it, so please just offer advice.

the main reasons are the taste of toothpaste, the feeling of the bristles, and never really being pushed to (though i can't blame my mom, i was/am a very difficult child).

i have also never been to a dentist before. i have ADHD (diagnosed) but i am not medicated for it. i also have a bad diet and kind of just sit in my room all day if that adds anything. (i know the diet thing does).

i tried to use bubblegum toothpaste before but it ended up being used by my family because i didn't use it quick enough and they ran out of their normal toothpaste. (i dont blame them. we have a lot of money problems and its not like i was gonna use it anyways)

if there are any cheap ways to fix this problem, easy ways to trick myself into this habit, or even just give a named reason to this, please let me know"
"I started therapy again a while ago and my therapist made a metaphor that learning how to live and how to have feelings is like running on one leg for all your life, and you didn‚Äôt know anything else so you became good enough at it and its your normal until you changed your environment / went to therapy / life throws a big trigger and you learn that surprise surprise you have a second leg. A horribly untrained, stick like second leg thats never been used. And now you could actually learn how to walk, how to run, how to *function normally*. 

Somehow that metaphor worked for me and i build it bigger to understand how i‚Äôm feeling. 

I feel like my life is a treadmill going 6mph. Maybe that‚Äôs not super fast but i only run with one leg. I make it work but it‚Äôs exhausting. Yes that one leg got strong, it‚Äôs putting in a lot of work but somehow i always end up slower/more tired than everyone else. And now somehow my second leg got untied and i want to use it. I want to learn how to feel things, how to life live like a *normal person,* how to make life less exhausting. 

But learning how to use the new leg when my treadmill is going so fast and i have 20 other things to worry about (responsibilities, job, house etc) which in this comparison look like people talking to me on the treadmill,  things i have to do simultaneously, stuff my hands are working on all while i‚Äôm trying not to freaking stumble and crash. 

And people ask me ‚Äúwhy is A so hard for you‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy does B feel so overwhelming?‚Äù . Well because i can‚Äôt freaking walk normally. And i can‚Äôt focus on anything else. Everytime i try to focus on a task it feels so much more complicated, so much more exhausting and difficult than what it *should* feel like. And finally i feel like i really understand why. I try not to blame myself anymore. But i don‚Äôt know how to continue from here. 

I asked my therapist how i am supposed to learn how to walk while my life-treadmill is going so fast. i don‚Äôt have the financial means to make my treadmill slower (taking a few weeks of work or something). I don‚Äôt even have a stable job and searching for jobs/ applying etc already takes so much of my energy. I feel like the things that are supposed to be helping (daily walks, mindfullness /stepping off the treadmill for a second) only add to the things standing around my treadmill screaming at me to give them my attention. 

Where do i fing the energy to actually do the things that will help me? How do i find the energy to do these things while i need to use all my energy for my jobs/financial stability? 

I‚Äòm sorry if this comparison got a little confusing but somehow it works best for my brain. Any advice would mean a lot! "

Since I moved to Australia, I cry a lot at nights. It started with my grandpa succumbing to cancer in the first year of my move. After my son was born, I kept crying and thinking of death.
 We have moved houses for 3 times and I can recall crying in bed trying to hide my tears from my husband in each one of them, but he never really knew.  Until one day when they had to keep me in the hospital to validate that I had depression and my husband was there with me. 
They were asking me questions about my feelings for the last however long period.  As soon as he heard me talking about the attempt of cutting  my veins, he rushed out of the room crying. 
He's been very caring but we have never really had anything in common except for our values. His fun is different to mine, our paths have evolved to be even more different now, that I don't really want to go to the parties he goes to. 
The only thing keeping me alive are my parents abroad. 
Otherwise, here I am - a waste of human body on this earth just hanging there thinking maybe it's my life purpose that I have to find yet ? 
Maybe it's because I am with the wrong person I am not able to find my path ?

"Hi thanks for reading if you made it here. I‚Äôm a 28F having a *really* hard time managing my mind lately. 

Just some backstory:
We grew up poor, this had a lot to do with a general anxiety/depression from the start. 

In 2012 my dad got sick. Since he was the main source of income, our house foreclosed and we (mom, dad, older, &amp; younger brother) moved into a house with my grandma - who was recovering from lung cancer. I started my first year of college and my dad passed away a couple months into my first semester. I was 18

In 2016 my mom got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and was put on feeding tubes. I had quit my job to take care of her full time and take her to chemo. She passed in 2017. I was 22. 

Just recently, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and while on short term disability from work to figure out treatment, my grandma passed away due to pneumonia complications. 

I feel extreme sadness and contemplate the purpose of life daily. I even quit my decent paying bank job after 8 years in my career with the company. 

My 2 brothers before mentioned, never helped with my parents when they were sick even though we all lived together. We haven‚Äôt lived together since 2018 and they only contact me if they want money so I have been cutting them off. 

I have my fianc√©, but he‚Äôs a truck driver and is only home a couple days a week. His son, which is virtually as my own, is one of the few people along with my fianc√© that are keeping me going. 

***I just have this immense sense of loss, no direction, and I feel like I‚Äôm starting to destroy my life. I am here to ask if anyone has been through anything so heavy and how do you make it out the other end in tact?

(I am on 50mg of pristiq)

"I (F19) have major depressive disorder. I‚Äôm trying to live a normal college life, I‚Äôve made some good friends and am trying to try my hand at dating, but the depression makes me feel like it‚Äôs way too selfish to do anything. It tells me that I‚Äôm worthless and nobody would ever love me. I can‚Äôt live my life this way. No matter how good my day is I can‚Äôt stop thinking about ending my life, and the truth is I really want to live. I want to keep learning about the things that interest me, fall in love, and hang out with my friends. Why cant I just have that without wanting to die all the time.

"Everything became messy and confused in just some days, I can't keep up with myself. I've been in my bubble for some years (4-5), keeping myself busy with things I liked while neglecting everything I was and literally not thinking anything at all that could really touch me. It's really hard to explain, but after a trauma I was in bed 24/7 for like 3 months, every breath was poison, every thought was death. I even developed heart issue (all cause emotional pain) and had to take a pill. One day I just stopped living and I became some sort of robot that goes day by day, not feeling anything. 2 weeks ago I started watching a series, I loved it immediately, I started to fall in love with MC, and I was just looking forward to watching more episodes the next day. 1 week pass, the series finishes and I decide it's time for me to be whatever I am meant to be in my fucking head. The fact is, I loved the MC but I am actually just like her very deep inside myself, I find the way she lives life everyday the most precious thing in the world. But I am me, this is the real world and I am honestly so tired of being myself. My love for the MC shifted to the actress like it was the most humanly thing in the world, I am to really force myself to not think about her, to not think about the fact that it's crazy to feel something this deep and pure for a person I didn't even know existed 2 weeks ago, I never talked to her, she doesn't know I exist etc. My journey to be the really best version of myself as today, is brighter than ever. No appetite at all, can't sleep, I get sleepy, I go to bed, my mood drops drastically and I can't sleep. For some moments I may think ""I am good, I just want to help others and be relevant in a positive way in this world"" and then, like 10 minutes after I'm struggling breathing cause I'm nothing, I wasted so much time, I hate it here, this house, how everything in my life just happened, day by day, I can't even think of 1 time I was happy jesus Christ, I just want to appreciate it all, the little things, my cats, my pillow, my only family member still alive, but I am here, completely hopeless and no matter how hard I try, I can't love myself, It hurts so much. I am not good at dealing with pain, I am just not good at being a human I've come to realize. I don't think there's something someone can do to help me at this point, it's been some days I've been here wandering on Reddit reading all kind of things, it just seems like motivations is something not compatible with me. Then there's the other part, like things will get better, everything could happen, I will be be a glorious father of 4. I am not believing any of this, don't get me wrong, I would want to believe it with all my heart, I just can't. And yes, all this happened cause I watched a series on Netflix basically. (well I should've seen this coming for a while I guess) This post will be a tremendous mess, I wrote everything that came to my mind relentlessly because it actually helps me not overthinking too much I guess, I'm sorry and thank you."
"I‚Äôve had problems with brain fog during rainy weather days for awhile,but its especially difficult to handle since I‚Äôm out getting ready for a job now.Makes my anxiety and depression worse due to extreme fatigue I can‚Äôt shake completely."

I‚Äôm sorry it may seem like my problems are not as big as the people here but i‚Äôm having major academic stress becauss of studying for my degree and my parents especially my mom keeps pressuring the shit out of me and i just cant live with it anymore nothing i do is ever enough and i just dont want to live with my parents anymore I‚Äôd rather be homeless hungry and cold than to be stuck here with my mom please someone tell me what to do
"I keep feeling so sad. Like extreme sadness. It‚Äôs almost everyday and I hate feeling like this. It‚Äôs like I want to just jump in front of a semi going 80 and be gone. Sometimes I‚Äôll even be happy and then I‚Äôll randomly get sad sometimes even start crying. I know my current life situation doesn‚Äôt help but, I feel like a big part of it is just sadness for no reason hence me being happy one second and sad the next. Has anyone found anything to help with this feeling BESIDES medicine? "
"I thought i was healed from depression. But today i had a fight with my family and after a few months without any triggers im depressed again.

However I live in a different state and to be honest we were never super close. I have started to send her a quote/poem/song/screenshot everyday to let her know I am here for her.

"Often times when I get depressed, I tend to withdraw. Of course moodiness is a part of it, too. But a lot of times it seems like people take that personally. Sometimes it‚Äôs even taken as arrogance or something like that. It‚Äôs maddening because it‚Äôs hard enough to battle depression, then it seems like I‚Äôm battling friends and family, too. Does anyone else experience anything like this, or am I maybe just doing something wrong? "
"Quite often I find myself convinced nothing is real. What is this place? What are we? None of it makes sense. We are born with no concept of choice and blindly follow the herd through life. What is the point really? I'm by no means suicidal but I feel like I'm missing the 'quest' part of life. I grew up without much structure but have always succeeded. I have my own family, life is great...but it isn't. Life just doesn't make sense. I feel the presence of a higher power but I have no idea how to put a word on it. I struggle with religion because it makes absolutely no sense to me how everyone isn't worshipping the same thing. Why would God smite all of the people who lives an honest and moral life just because they called him by a different name? That is if the stories we are told are true. How do we know that for sure? How do we know anything this isn't some elaborate stage set up to fool the people. A fairy tale or false hope for the people. I feel as if free will is an illusion. We aren't alone here. And most importantly I have never felt so far from reality. What is this place?"
"My thoughts overwhelm me whenever I'm alone and it makes it really hard to sleep properly or sleep well, or to have any nice thoughts really, it's just been really tiring trying to forget abt all the pain I've been through I guess, I mean I know I can't just forget about it. I just want to be at peace even for a few days in exhausted and tired, all I really want is something some peace of mind anything."

My life is horrible even tho I deserve it. My parents only care about school and grades and I haven‚Äôt heard about how I‚Äôm doing in years now. I‚Äôve decided to buy a calendar and circled a day two months away from now and if my life doesn‚Äôt get better I‚Äôm ending it. I‚Äôm still a virgin of course and I haven‚Äôt experienced real love or anything like it and since we moved across the country 4 years ago I haven‚Äôt had any friends. I‚Äôm doing bad at school and not even working out or doing sports and just getting fat and dumb but I‚Äôm too afraid to go to the gym even tho I go sometimes but the people just stare at me there and at school the only thing I‚Äôm good at is English. I go to medical middle school if you can call it that way and even tho I‚Äôm still bad at it but I just like helping others so I tried it. I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm writing this here not that it would change anything but I just wanted to talk to someone before I‚Äôm gone because honestly I don‚Äôt see me getting better even tho I would like to try. If anyone has an idea of how to try to improve my life or ME go for it idk if I should write my instagram here so that anyone could maybe dm me but I‚Äôm really lonely not gonna lie. I just want some friends and a little attention."
"i don‚Äôt understand how people work &amp; go to school. right now i‚Äôm in community college and i fucking hate every second of it. last semester all i did was drink and land my ass in a psych ward. i dropped out of all my classes except 2, &amp; one i failed. still, i enrolled this semester after all that and i regret it deeply. i mainly enrolled because i didn‚Äôt want to be completely isolated from people. i have no interest in school at all and the only way i finish my assignments is if i overdose on adderall and drink a million milliliters of caffeine. i‚Äôm having a hard time attending because of my terrible sleep schedule or simply just not being able to get myself to go. id drop out but my parents are paying for it &amp; i dont want them to waste their money. they will not be happy with me.

but then, if i drop out id probably need to get a job. but i‚Äôm in no position to hold a job because i have not been able to overcome my extreme social anxiety. last job i had was a shit show and actually made it worse. honestly i can‚Äôt imagine why anyone would hire me. 

but then, i know if i were to just withdraw from society i will spiral again.

everyone just goes ‚Äúget over it, welcome to the real world‚Äù but i keep trying &amp; it‚Äôs not working."
"The wanting to do stuff but the in ability to feel anything just makes me overwhelmed ....I just dont know how to fill my time

  

The only hobby I really have is art and games, though Ive found growing up the only games id play are halo or pokemon or obscure games you get in those 3000 in 1 ds cartridges.

I guess maybe I miss being social, but i also feel like a lot of games dont interest me idk if just how i grew up or Im not a that much into gaming.

Would play hell divers if they had difficulty settings for solo play same for star ship troopers.

I generally dont know what to do with myself ...I think I have hard time immersing myself I know have sleep apnea and who knows what other undiagnosed issues ive got tbh the main one being digeorge syndrome a chromosome deletion.

i hate being bored but sometimes I wonder if gaming isnt it for me But idk how else to fill my time"
Has anyone taking Anandatol? Results? Side effects?
"Hi all. I (46f) have been living with depression &amp; anxiety since age 14, and was diagnosed with ADHD at 40. 

I spoke to my doctor about a possible in-patient program to help me get massively unstuck and be able to move forward with my life.

Has anyone done short-term in-patient treatment and if so, what was it like? Thanks in advance for your advice."
"After years of being depressed and learning more about myself i think i finally overcame it. I dont feel it anymore. But there is one big problem, i miss it. It sounds weird but for months now ive been in a state where i cant decide what i want from life. I want to become a great person, but i like being depressed, i think it suits me, i think bad/unhealthy habits are what define me.

I also go to therapy but i dont feel like saying anything about this to her because ... i feel weird. I really want to be better, be more social, work on my self, my looks, study more, get more friends and be more social. And i can do this, because i did it before, its not like i cant do it if i put my mind tomorrow. But i feel like i dont deserve nothing of this. 

I wont elaborate my problems but a lot them came from parents and partners, wich got me in a miserable state for around 4 years. I always kept going even after ruining my life over and over again. But half a years ago things changed and i just stopped being depressed. I went into a state of numbness and i cant decide what motivates me. 

I want to be more close with my friends, but i like to stay alone because it makes me feel bad. I like to be an active person but i like feeling bad about not doing it. I want to desperately talk to someone about my feelings and thoughts but that implies getting better. I want to get in a relationships, but that means 2 things: being happy and growing with another person wich is a good thing, so im scared of it ... and second i have BPD and a relationship would mean chaos so ... i like it. 
I feel good when im sad,and bad when i feel good.

(there are a lot more problems involved but i think this is enough for that particular problem)"

"   


I have been depressed since as long as I can remember. I tell myself every day that I'm gonna do ""it"" tomorrow, but I never do. I feel like all hope is lost for me because of the way I was raised. I had terrible, terrible, TERRIBLE parents. I was born with missing fingers (like my hands look like a Vulcan symbol from Star Trek, I get made fun of for it a lot), as if that wasn't already bad enough, then at 5 years old my father takes me on a bike ride and I get involved in a traumatic car accident and as a result I now suffer from being half-deaf, and paralysis in the right side of my face so every time I speak my lips move weird, it's like an uncanny valley effect. I hate it because those are the first things people notice when I talk to them, and I feel like it puts them off, and as a result I just feel like no girl will ever want to marry me because these are genetic problems, and I feel it's just human nature that when you're deciding your partner, you are also deciding what you want your potential children to look like. I'm not ugly by any means, I'm not fat, but these things still drag me down cus I feel that's what other people notice and consider when talking to me.) I have a massive overbite, and my parents never got me braces, but of course they got my brother braces. I grew up in an awful household, parents always fighting, attacking each other, yelling matches, etc. One time after my head trauma a few years later, my brother and I must have pissed my dad off so much because he grabbed both of our heads and clanked them together. I don't know how ANYONE could do that to their children, especially one who has had severe brain trauma. My parents got divorced when I was 12, which was a really rough time for my brother and I, and both of us suffer from depression as a result. I wish my parents never had me. I don't know how anyone could have kids knowing there's a high chance the kid will be born disabled. It comes off as selfish. I don't think a lot of parents want to raise their kids, which I believe is the case for me. Most people want to raise babies, but once that child hits a certain age the parents start giving less and less care. I was never listened to as a child, always ignored. I remember there were times I'd show my parents something or want to play a board game with them, but they gave me the cold shoulder. I still love them because they are my parents, and God commands us to honor or parents, but I feel that love isn't reciprocated. I can't remember the last time I got a hug from either of them. My mom tells me she loves me, but I don't think my dad ever has. I feel as a result to this, I have grown bitter to a lot of people, and I don't think I am normal, not just because my hands and feet are all messed up, but because I don't know if my process of thinking will ever be normal because of my traumatic head injury. I don't like therapy because no one understands what it is like to be me, and every time I've seen a therapist they always give me the same bogus excuse of ""Oh do something you enjoy to take your mind off of it"" ""Try talking to your parents"" etc. I‚Äôve tried everything, and I cannot seem to get closure. I wanted to do ""it"" the second I turned 18, but I didn't, and here we are. I take edibles as a result of all this trauma cus I feel like it makes me tranquil for a set period of time, and I don't need to think about the stuff that constantly drags me down. I've lost all hope for a better future for me. "
"What happens is that I am studying medicine at a university in my city, however, when I try to study I can not retain anything, I mean that I do not record anything, for example I am reading a slide I spend about 6 and I already forgot the first one. It is a long time that this has been happening to me, I do not remember the last time I learned something by heart, it is true that it is not good to learn things by heart, however, in careers like mine sometimes it is essential. 
In retrospect I have to say that I was a good student in school, in fact I was on the honor roll, but, the last time I learned something by heart I remember it was about 11 years ago. 
I don't know what I should do, I'm getting frustrated, and I don't know what to do, I feel a little helpless. 
Something else when I learned things I immediately forgot and I have a constant fear of saying things wrong and that makes me do it wrong."
"I‚Äôm 36, diagnosed with depression and ADHD over 20 years ago. This past year a new therapist says I show signs of PTSD. I don‚Äôt really care WHAT I have, i just want to feel better. 

Anyone else been on an SSRI for over 20 years and just not have the motivation or energy to move AT ALL? Like I never leave bed and I‚Äôm really upset if for any reason I have to. I don‚Äôt take care of my home or my dogs as well as I used to and I don‚Äôt know how long this can go on. I only shower and leave bed if I have to work, but this week there was some drama there and now I don‚Äôt even know if I have a job anymore, but I‚Äôm completely numb to it. 

I thought I‚Äôd be happier when I lost the weight I put on in college, I‚Äôm finally dropping pounds, but aside from being less disgusted with what I see in the mirror, I don‚Äôt feel any better. I don‚Äôt have more energy, I don‚Äôt feel anything. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be a little better if I climb out of a crappy financial situation I‚Äôm in, but I can‚Äôt imagine being able to drag myself out of bed and to a job more than 3x‚Äôs a week. 

I‚Äôm terrified of meds that‚Äôll put my very hard to lose weight back on, I‚Äôm scared of an additional diagnosis, but I‚Äôm most scared that I‚Äôll live like this for another 30+ years. I‚Äôm not suicidal I‚Äôm just not anything. I‚Äôm numb, I‚Äôm tired &amp; I‚Äôm really disappointed in myself and the life I‚Äôm barely living. 

I was just wondering if anyone else has done the meds and the therapy and climbed out of this hole. Thanks."
"I just walked downstairs and saw that my dog pooped and peed on the carpet. I immediately cleaned it up but I couldn‚Äôt help but think it was my fault because I hadn‚Äôt taken him out yet. I‚Äôm a 38 toddler mom and lately I‚Äôve been feeling as though I don‚Äôt have enough energy to play or engage him how I used to. I‚Äôve been resorting to screen time and food. My husband is a super go-getting kind of person, frequently out of the house and much more social than me ‚Äî lately, I‚Äôve been wondering if I‚Äôm with the right person or if he is, for that matter. I‚Äôm really venting, but today feels so much harder than I want it to. I take meds and have therapy. Money is tight for me, but my husband says it‚Äôs fine because we ‚Äúknew‚Äù as I‚Äôm growing my business my income would fluctuate. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ from the outside it may appear fine. But my internal experiences feel like garbage that‚Äôs gone bad. At least I showered today, I guess ‚Äî that‚Äôs down to every 3 days or so. Can anyone offer support? I‚Äôm super down."
"I suffer from depression and dr/dp. At times it's so hard to feel connected to those around me. It's really scary to feel like you don't care about the people who you are supposed to be closest to. I don't even feel close to them anymore. This happens quite often, but sometimes I get bursts of feeling love again, but as you can tell it's one of those times where I feel disconnected. What should I do? I really hate feeling like this and it's so hard to talk with my friends and family. I really hate this."
"TW:Suicide,selfharm,Incel behaviours and lexicon.

Already posted on r/SuicideWatch, but it havent gained any actual reaction besides one person telling me that im just a dick, and someone recommending me therapy so i decided to post it here also.(Also posted on r/depression but never got approved by mods)

So I'm probably the most liberal, bluepilled, feminist person I know or atleast i was, it's always been my thing, even though my friend group sometimes might look toxic or angry we actually were quite a friendly community, and even there i was a bit more gentle and sensual person. I wanted the world to be a happy and a kind place. However in the last couple months I feel like im slowly going insane, and I feel my own views changing rapidly and my character crumbling. Ive never had anyone romantically interested in me even for a little bit and that's just making me go insane because I thought that love is the greatest feeling ever since my youngest days, and even though i do have friends, and family i feel a need in a romantic love and a special connection with someone. Hitting a brick wall while doing everything I could was just too humiliating, so at one point I started consuming incel content, then it became something regular, now I even have an account on the forum where I post sometimes, people peer hating incels didn't make it easier so its hard to still not being completely consumed with that type of thing. At first it was a place where I'm not laughed at or looked down upon, then I started believing some of incel takes, and yesterday I was watching and reading everything I could about Elliot Rodger, and somehow didn't felt disgusted by his actions, I was a pacifist in the past and I used to think that murder is the worst thing person could to other human being, but I didn't felt that anymore, I thought about him as a misunderstood person, as a someone who didn't do anything bad even though I knew he's a cold blooded killer. And now I feel like I should kill myself before I become even worse than I am right now, what if I could be dangerous in the long run, what if my sanity just ends and I will end as someone who kills other people, what if I will stop seeing any need in a society and lose all my morals. I will have to end myself before I harm anyone, I have a few thoughts about how I will do it, I won't say them cuz I'm afraid someone else could use them as an advice, but I have a few not too badly hurting methods. I just don't want to make my family and my few friends sad, I know that some of them hate me, but they probably don't wish me dead, it would break my mother heart, and probably be a huge scar on my father heart, hes might not look too emotional but i see myself in him and i know that he will treat it like his own fault. Maybe there is a way to make it look like an accident so it hurts them less then my suicide.

I'm sorry if that's barely readable, Im pretty much unable to be alive without a few shots of vodka these days, and English is not even my native language, I just felt like I should ask for help."
So recently Ive been thinking of killing myself at night for the past few days now. I am a teen so there is a possibility that its just my hormones acting up. I always feel like I can change everything but haven't because I am a genuinely lazy person. I just want to know whether Im actually depressed or if Im just faking it. I want to know because I might end up doing something stupid soon.
"I've had ptsd, depression and social anxiety for a long time. But I had been working for the last 2-3 years. Then I took a really bad hit to the head in November, haven't felt the same since. But I ended up getting fired for the first time from my third job. It was deserved, my mental health had severely declined and the hit to the head didn't help. I was on a final warning when it happened for not showing up. My insomnia was wrecking me.

I applied for jobs but my anxiety was too great. I just can't get the idea that I am an unrecoverable failure out of my head. I haven't had close friends in a while and I'm really alone apart from my parents, and they're pretty narcissistic. When I was working my mum would call me daily to have a go at me and rip into me for all of my flaws. I actually was brainwashed enough to call that unrelenting stress support when I should have cut her off. It's all my fault, and although the 2-3 hour commute was brutal, I loved that job.

Now I'm lying in bed all day. I just feel tired and I can't sort my sleep schedule out still so there is no point looking for another job. But I'm losing hope and strength fast. I'm starving, barely have any money, had to go on benefits. I hate living like this, but the idea of getting up and doing everything that would help me leaves me frozen in fear. Even when I organised interviews I just felt like I have some kind of mental block against it. 

I'm aware that whatever I do, I'm going to be miserable. It's going to suck. But I just don't know what I'm fighting for anymore. Everyone I love has betrayed me, and I'd love to forgive them all and move on but I'm just stuck with this rage at myself and the world. It hasnt been fair to me, and I used to be so damn strong. But I'm just unravelling. I feel broken and powerless."
"Hey...

I know you've turned into this bold, beautiful and braver version of your old self but please don't discredit your past struggles because you don't resonate with them anymore... What seems petty now may have meant the world to you back then... Your growth does not diminish the pain you endured. 

This goes to say, you CAN overcome all the things you're going through right now. You did in the past... The more you grow, the stronger and more resilient you become. The things you're dealing with right now may have become stronger but so have you. I know you've got this and for what it's worth, I'm here for you... You're not alone"
"As title says I am not sure if I am depress, but lately I have been feeling without motivation to do anything, I feel my life is stuck, I know what I should do‚Ä¶ I use to love reading but now all I want is to lay and look at my phone, I like to paint‚Ä¶ but I feel lazy all the time, there are bunch of things I know I need to do but I procrastinate until last minute to do them.
I feel alone (even I am in a relationship, where sometimes I do t wanna be), I just want to sometimes cry and run to a place where no one knows me‚Ä¶ but here I am laying in front of my phone cause crying is not an option for me.
I don‚Äôt want to drink any pills for depression (if I have it), because I feel it should be something that motivates me and give me energy‚Ä¶ but I just feel lazy, and the worst is that I know I am doing wrong just looking how my life pass in front of my eyes.
Sometimes I wonder what would be if I stop existing‚Ä¶ but then I think I have a nice life overall‚Ä¶ yet I feel I don‚Äôt have a reason.
Is so confusing in my mind, to know what I have to do but not having the motivation or courage to do it."
"Hi, I am slowly losing everyone I care about and I don't know what to do. I am trying my best to be a good friend, to give support whenever needed. I admit, I don't know everything or sometimes how to help, but I am trying my best. Everyone but one person left me. I am starting to think that I am the problem but I don't know what is wrong with me. Something must be, right? I am starting to lose hope in my existence, I am starting to think that whenever I make a new friend they leave me. I don't know what to do anymore. Can someone give me some advice how to get through and maybe make some friends that will actually stay?"
"Im 28. I never thought I'd make it past 18. Every single year since 18, I've not cared and just thought, ""Anytime now."" I've been sitting here trying to write down my values and think about who i am as a person without focusing on my past mistakes. I've been trying so hard to get to know who i am, but i dont know how. It's like im surface with myself. I dont know how to intellectually converse with anyone, i dont have skills, i dont have hobbies, and i have nothing. 

I am trying so hard to gain some substance about myself, but i dont know where to start. How do i care? How do i want more for myself than the bare minimum of surviving? 
Im so lost. Im just here crying because i am literally a shell that wants to be more now. I've gone my entire life not wanting to be anything, and now that i want to live, there is nothing left for me because of my own stupid actions, and i dont know how to start over."
"I feel so much dread about my past self and now, it's like i'm stuck between two times and spaces, it's like i am out of sync when i'm in depression, and i doubt every action i take or word i speak."
"I have seen so many people who are going through tough times in their life, and people just ignore it by saying that ""You're just asking for attention"" bla bla bla. So even if they were asking for attention, why is that such a terrible thing? Aren't there some underlying causes why people might crave for attention? And sorry for posting this in so many subreddits, the reason is that I want diverse perspectives."
"Very few outsiders understand what depression is, let alone recognise it when they see it. Depressed people are labelled as lazy, melancholic, boring, draining, uninteresting or whatever else. And of course, depressed people in an acute phase of depression don't have the energy to set things right. Not to even speak of the undiagnosed ones.    

I'd like to share this, fully aware that many people here are barely able to keep living, myself included (diag.: severe depression). My past few days have been good, and I've had some patience to try and communicate. That includes, in my case, my mother, who is worried about losing me, but the moment I say something remotely questioning my childhood (childhood abuse survivor, but mostly my father), gets hostile. Neither is helpful. 

Let me make an analogy: if a dementia sufferer does not recognise you, you take it personally, as if they were indifferent to YOU. When you learn that occasionally not recognising familiar people is a trait of dementia, you're fine and loving with the person as ever. Same thing, just more visible, for, say, wheelchair bound people vs. couch potatoes - it just takes a different angle of understanding. I am annoyed if someone tries to make the possibility of my death about themselves. But I have also tried, to the extent of energy available, to talk with close people and try help them understand. Because, to go back to the analogy, you can easily UNDERSTAND that dementia causes occasional non-recognition. But you'd never DISCOVER that for yourself if you hadn't been told. 

Feel free to use that analogy as a talking impulse, how depression brings its own symptoms, some of which might feel like a personality change to an outsider, some like the same old you. And also how none of them are ABOUT the outsider or an expression of your love to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

But this is not just for the people close to you. So much suffering among depressed would end if there were more general understanding and awareness. Let alone an end of stigma! As a reminder, homosexuality was deemed a mental disorder in western countries until the 1970s!! Only dialogue changed that: by creating understanding. Even someone who is not homosexually inclined can understand that OTHERS are, and that they are not deranged or perverted for it! This level of understanding only came through communication and openness. Clearly, the depressed community has an inherent disadvantage here, because if we had the same energy and joy in living OUR lives that the queer community has, we would be cured. 

But for the little energy we have, or for the few people reading this that do have energy and are not themselves depressed, I want to implore you, communicate, explain, share, make analogies, help people understand. The amount of times I was called lazy, hostile, unfriendly or selfish, I can't count. When in fact it was depression. Undiagnosed at that time, so I swallowed and felt worse. Luckily, I had subconscious mechanisms caring more about me and my needs than about what others think of me. But even so, I was close to death, surviving purely by coincidence, and whilst I'm here, with the little energy I have, I'd like to encourage everyone for the little change they can make -

Pretty boys and pretty girls, please don't think it's useless, pointless, too late, irrelevant etc. to talk about our condition, nor that your close people won't care or couldn't understand or would feel unduly burdened! Even my abusive parents had a moment to spare. There's hope in humanity.

In another thread, people describe their mental state as being trapped in deep, dark, cold, murky water, or like your entire family died - every day all over again. Those are very good analogies to give outsiders a glimpse into our minds. 

But also talk about how you feel, what you'd need or wish or whatever else comes to mind or might, in the scope depression still allows, feel ""important"", like it needs to be said. ""You're important to me. It's a bit less terrible when you're here."" or ""Everyone and everything is too much right now, I need calm to recharge, I need to close my eyes for a while, I need to breathe."" All of those are gonna sound silly; find your own. My experience is just that ANY words may be helpful when you have none. 

And when there is a moment of slightly more clarity, maybe this is a though? ""Depression is a mental condition where you feel completely devoid of energy, will, power, joy of life, meaning, or desire to do, be or achieve anything. That may not always be the case with a sufferer or pertain to everything, but when it hits, it's sudden, and please try to understand and respect that.""

Or if someone asks whether they can do something, maybe ""just be there.""

"Apologies in advance that this will be long.

In the middle of October 2023 I [F22] started seeing a new guy [M20]. A few days before Christmas, he wanted to go on break. It's complicated but he was going through personal struggles related to finances and being very busy. The timing sucked and I didn't want to not be with him, but I wanted to respect his wishes and needs.

And... I really tried to be okay with a break. I tried to use the time to improve myself. But I just couldn't. I missed him. It didn't feel right when we'd message each other every once in a while as just friends... not boyfriend and girlfriend at that point anymore 

So I tried talking it out, compromising, etc. But every solution or compromise was turned down. He told me it wasn't me at all. Just him and his problems and he couldn't do it.

I told him he could block me if I was getting to be to much. He said he didn't want to but would warn me if it ever got to that.

Last night I messaged him spilling my heart out basically, being completely honest about how I was feeling about everything, some other stuff going on.

I did go a little too crazy and emotional, nothing aggressive towards him as I still care very much but I guess I probably came off very obsessive and panicky. But I have bad abandonment issues. Especially when it comes to relationships. He knew this

This afternoon there was still no response. I asked if he was ignoring me. Asked him to please talk to me... nothing. And then he proceeded to block me on everything.

I feel like shit. I feel lost. I feel like I'm not myself. I'm scared maybe I am unloveable. I miss him so much but I'm also so mad at him. I'm also so mad at myself. Thinking of all the things I could've done better. And just heartbroken. I hate that I always fall in love so deeply and so hard, so easily. And I can't find anyone that can just feel the same about me and not want to leave. Or some big problem coming up pushing us apart. 

Sometimes I feel a literal ache in my chest. I just wish I could turn off my feelings for him. Make this stop hurting. So I can just move on.

I don't feel like doing any of the things that might cheer me up. Don't have the motivation and when I do do something, I'm inevitably reminded of everything that's happened and I'm back to crying.

But, the positive side of me is reminding myself that I've gotten through stuff like this before and I will be okay. Just gotta hold on.

I'm lonely though."
"Hello i am Micael. I will kill myself in about 3 weeks, and i am sure about it( i moved away from alot of friends so i think anyone will get hurt about it, and my family hates me so, its everthing ok). And i only came here to ask with u (community) have something to say for me. I really love life, and the whole world. I love study about it. but this place was not made for me. Soooo, take it like a one of the last human experiencies that i will have in my life. Thank u for every reply&lt;3 it mean alot for me.  


i love u dude, dont do the same that i will do:)"
"I've been having some high anxiety for the past few days after stopping weed after a two week period of smoking it every day. I've read that high dose vitamin C supplementation can help with withdrawals from drugs so I've taken  a relatively high dose of vitamin C in the form of ascorbic acid about 45 minutes ago and now my anxiety seems to have gone away. 

Now, I can't say for sure if it was just coincidence or not and very well could be placebo effect but I'll take it! 

Just passing this along in case it's helpful to others. I've also read that vitamin C can help with depression and anxiety. It's my understanding that high dose vitamin C is relatively safe and you just pee out what your body doesn't use. Probably don't want to take a shit ton of it though just to be safe."
"I talked to my husband and told him how depressed I was feeling and that I'd thought about hurting myself. He was very concerned and asked if he should take me to the hospital to get help. I told him no, not at this point. He asked if I had a plan, I said vaguely I did, same thing I'd do the last time things got bad. I promised him I'd talk to him before doing anything.

I'm 58, I've been fighting these feelings since I was a teenager. I'm friendlessness, my family has drift apart and I can't talk to my siblings. My Dad is to old to burden with this. We've got no money, which is a big part of the problem. Can't afford to see my therapist. Bill collectors are calling. I'm terrified to talk to them.

I'm forcing myself to eat, no appetite. If I don't be careful, the rare disease I suffer from will act up more and make me sicker. I'm so tired of it all. I never thought life would be like this at my age. I'm so lonely, I don't know what to do."
"I‚Äôm scared of dying and I‚Äôve never had any desire to kill myself because of that but it is getting increasingly harder for me to exist every day. 

First off I‚Äôm tired of being endlessly targeted and harassed nonstop for being myself. I‚Äôm unable to post about it or vent on any platforms without my harassers taking screenshots of everything I write and posting it everywhere to laugh at or make fun of. This has been going for about a year now. The reason they do this in the first place is because I have severe emotional issues, both diagnosed and undiagnosed, which makes me easy prey. And they think this is a joke, that I‚Äôm making it up for attention or because I‚Äôm lazy. I can‚Äôt work, so therefore I‚Äôm a fully useless member of society and shouldn‚Äôt be alive according to them. They actively try to get others to brigade against me in any way they can. I can‚Äôt even write this here right now without thinking of the various ways they‚Äôll pick it apart and use it to ridicule me. It‚Äôs a given at this point and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it but resolve myself.

I don‚Äôt have a therapist currently as the last one I had didn‚Äôt take me seriously either. The reason I post everything online in the first place is because I need to get it all off my chest and know that someone is listening even if they can‚Äôt help me. I have no other options really.

I don‚Äôt know if I would describe myself as actually suicidal because as I said in the title, I don‚Äôt truly want to die, but I‚Äôm so desperate and tired of suffering endlessly. Things just never seem to improve and I‚Äôm really questioning why I‚Äôm even alive these days. I don‚Äôt think anything will ever get better for me. I have no purpose. I hit rock bottom and I find a way to keep going lower somehow."
"I need heart surgery, but nothings really going right. Aw well sending cheer"
"2023 has been an incredibly rough year. Over the course of this year I have

- Lost my job
- Been unable to find new work
- Been rapidly depleting my 401k to keep my mortgage floating
- Put down my dog
- And to top it all off my partner of 3 years left and moved out over Christmas at the lowest point in my life.

I haven't mustered the courage to call my parents and let them know the person they thought would become their daughter in law has left.

I'm depressed. I'm angry at the circumstances I find myself in. I want to go I to 2024 full of piss and vinegar and right the ship, but I don't know where to begin with picking up the pieces."
"New years has this expectation and stigma around it. 
It should be a fun night. 
You should be excited about the new year. 
Its a new beginning. 
Etc etc. 

But the truth is that it is just any other day but because of these expectations for some of us the closer we get to the stroke of midnight the more oppressive it feels. 

There's an added pressure to do and be better, and its great if you're in the place to do that but if you're not then please, don't buy into the hype! 

Don't feel compelled to make grand new years resolutions that usually just set you up to fail and feel worse about it. 

Don't feel like you have to have this amazing, fun night surrounded by people and noise. 
I'm in NZ and do you know what I'm doing tonight? Having a gin with my cat on my lap, Ricky Gervais Netflix special on writing this to you good people. 
And in my opinion its a bloody good evening! 

So yes tomorrow is a new week, month, and year. And if you want that to symbolise the start of a new you thats awesome.  But if tomorrow you get up and carry on doing the best you can each day then thats bloody fantastic too! 
And don't let anyone convince you otherwise.

Happy new year you beautiful people, stay strong and remember, it WILL get better, you just have to give it time."
"I feel hopeless and tired all the time that I dont want to get up and get myself to eat throughout the day anymore. I got rejected by many interviewers and think this time it's over for me...I dont feel there's any hope left in me...
I can't get out of this grip of heavy depression, l've lost any motivation to do anything and live life, what can I do...?"
"Sorry, I don‚Äôt know where else to ask. I‚Äôd appreciate it very much if someone would let me dm and listen to my problems. No need to give me proper advice or anything, just give me any sort of response. I just feel so incredibly alone lately. Thank you."
"So yesterday my family found out just how bad my depression is, my family made me book an appointment for the doctors and my brother called my dad.
This feels like relief in a way but I also feel bad as they now feel like they‚Äôve failed me and there was stuff that would hurt them that they now know.
Is there anyway I can help them with knowing about my depression?"
"Looking for advice. I am struggling with the worst bout of depression I have had in years. I'm having significant health issues, trying to juggle the finances of treatment, and dealing with a resurgence in trauma based behaviors that's sabotaging my relationships. On top of all of that I'm in my final semester of graduate school and searching for a job that will employ me by the time I graduate so I can pay of my student loans. The truth is, I'm drowning. I've spent every night for the past week contemplating burning all my existing relationships, distancing myself from family, and quietly committing suicide somewhere where I won't bother anyone with my absence. I'm not okay.

I don't know how to tell people this. I get the feeling that they're annoyed with me because I'm sad and lethargic all the time, because I opt out of plans. I've previously had friends ghost me because I talk too much about my issues, and it's gotten me to a point where I don't even bother telling my closest friends and family the true scope of what I'm feeling anymore. I know that even if I do open up there will be no solutions from them.

The few who have an idea of how bad things are getting ask me what they can do, and I just don't have an answer. To me, there's nothing anyone can do. I've done this so long by myself that all I can say is a 'thanks for listening' and then shut up about it so I won't pester them further. It's miserable. I want help, but I'm stuck in a place where I'm scared to ask for it for fear of pushing others away further, and not even knowing what to ask for.

I want help, but I don't know how to request it, and if I should even request it at all. There's a part of me that just thinks I shouldn't ask anything of anyone, and that I should just let myself rot so I don't bother people. The truth is I feel terrified of my future, scared, and so very alone. How can I ask for help? What do I even ask of the people who love me without asking too much and pushing them away?"
I am depressed during holidays because I don't have a spouse. And my Mother passed away about 3 years ago holidays aren't the same anymore. I am not closer to some of my family and I am going to spend holidays with them. But it is not the same without my mother and my mom and I always didn't get along I wish she was here . I feel very sad because I am alone and lonely and I wish I can have friends or a spouse. And I wish I was closer to my family . I hope I can cheer up soon.
I feel utter despair and so so alone. I‚Äôm on my own no one in my family cares about me or helps me at all. I am alone in the world and I am in agony. I‚Äôm struggling to get through shifts at work because it is all too much and I can‚Äôt make the dark thoughts go away
Hi I have low functioning depression and I isolate. I'm not currently in school because of my ED and life still feels so hard my family has recently called me out for isolating and life has been way harder ever since trying to interact with them

"I am not closer to my family anymore, I don't have any supporting friends or a spouse. My family don't get along with me and others they have they favorites and I am not one of them . I have been alone since my mom passed and we didn't get along either. I try hard to get along with everyone in the world they treat me like crap. I am very nice and shy keep to myself I get along with everyone and I am do what I told to do and I am still get treated like crap by everyone. When I see loving families together I get sad I wish my family all get along instead of holding grudge of what happened 25 years ago and when I lived in a different state. All my family do is scream and yell it got worse after my mom passed. I wish I was someone else and in different family. I wish I was important to people as they are to me. How do I cheer up ?"
"So obviously there must be something left in me since I care to an extent that I'm basically a lazy cunt leeching off my parents who will be retired soon. But generally I feel apathetic. I have no drive or ambition. I spend my days lying in bed mindlessly playing video games and watching videos to kill any kind of active thought that could cross my mind. I managed to graduate highschool a year and a half ago by some miracle of nature even after missing 6 cumulative months of school lol what a joke. I have zero marketable skills apart from minor python knowledge and that's nowhere near enough to get by on. I have literally zero will to lead anything that remotely resembles a life, I have no desire to change. And I truly wish I did but all I feel is anger at my parents for bringing me into this world. Like why should I even bother, not my problem, I didn't bring this on myself and when it gets especially bad ""maybe I'll commit purely out of spite so they'll feel bad for having created me"". And at the same time why should I have to commit and have to go through the pain and force myself to overcome those base survival instincts and experience the guilt of hurting the ppl who care abt me when I didn't ask for this. It's like handing someone a baby and forcing them to either raise it themselves or kill it. Why am I left with the responsibility. I've tried cbt, meds, exercise, art therapy but obviously none of it works because I just don't care. And yeah I just don't know what to do, I'm closer to suicide tonight than I've ever been. Clearly I care to an extent because I'm crying and if I were truly apathetic I wouldn't even be typing this post. But it's not strong enough of a will to translate into any kind of positive change"
"Let's say you're stuck in bed. You'd like to get up but there's a block there. You need to start small; maybe just take one blanket off, hang your leg off the side of the bed, whatever. But lately for me that first, small step is so fucking far away. I don't know what to do about it. 

I'm likely going to end up in voluntary admission at this rate due to suicidal behaviors regardless but I'd like to hear how other people make that first step when they're overwhelmed by depression."
I heard pregabalin is one
"I feel lost. I don't know where i am heading in my life or what to do next. everyday feels the same. I don't want to be around people. I feel like running away from everything. I stopped receiving calls of my friends from past few months and stopped texting everyone as well. Now, they don't even try contacting me. They came to me whenever they had any problems seeking solutions or comfort but no body ever asked from me if i was okay or how's my life was going on. Even if someone asks me i don't feel comfortable enough to trust anyone with my stuff. I enjoy being alone but it feels lonely, idk how do i explain this feeling. I don't want to talk to anyone, i dont know what to talk about. It feels blank. I used to be a good listener but now i feel frustrated if the convo becomes long or if the other person start discussing their issues with me, but still i listen to them and try my best to help. there has not been a single day when i have gone to sleep without crying . I feel hella bad but i don't for what. It feels like my life has been a waste, and I am a failure. I just want to disappear from everywhere online offline from everywhere. somedays i even think if ending my life will solve all these problems and by this i knew it's getting bad. But I don't know how to handle all these. All these self help books and activities are not helping. somedays it feels very tough to wake up from bed but still i have to do it anyhow coz i live with my family. even my family members feel annoying to me now. I know i won't be able to discuss all these even with my bestfriend. I used to tell him everything without a second thought but now i think 100 times about sharing anything to him and ultimately decide to keep everything to myself only. I don't know what to do with this. "
I am 19 female and I have a full time job and I also go to college part time. I am extremely exhausted and I just don‚Äôt have the drive to do anything anymore. I want to be better but I‚Äôm not sure where to start or if I have the time to. I feel like my job is such a dead end one that I think it‚Äôs pointless working.
Been depressed for I would say 4-3 years now. I‚Äôm still a teen and I know it‚Äôs young but I feel like it‚Äôs not gonna get better from here. I wish there was some tutorial to get me out of this whole or some way of chatting with a therapist (for free)
"I feel like I have no motivation to do anything anymore. Everyone around me expects me to be doing well in school, learning to drive, looking for a job maybe. But just existing feels hard and tiring enough. I don't know if I'm just a weak person or what, but I just feel generally apathetic about a lot of things nowadays. I used to love playing video games, I would play them for hours upon hours a day, but i stopped playing them. Even doing things I enjoy or enjoyed doesn't feel fun anymore. Is this just what happens when a person grows up? They feel sick and tired of everything in life. The last time I remember being truly happy was when I was young in elementary school."

"I'm a working single mom (34) of 5 kids. I'm also a workhorse. Today I noticed how depressed I get when I have relax time. Like feeling useless. My kids are at the age where they would rather sit and hangout with each other and not me. I love that about them. But when the quiet sets in for me I start to feel sad and useless. I have lots of different hobbies but I can't seem to get up and do any of them and it makes me even sadder. I try to make self care a priority in these moments but it's just not sufficient sometimes.  Not really sure what to do here. Some advice would be nice. 
Help!"

"I might be having a good day and out of nowhere this feelings will appear. I know it‚Äôs part of depression. I do therapy and take meds. They help me a lot, though this thoughts and feelings are always there. Any advice? "
"The last several years I frequently have discussions with myself about my own future and purpose. I am 58 years old, and in a nutshell I have failed in most ways and it is too late to turn things around. Plus, I no longer have the vigor and hope to do the things that might help myself.

The best argument I can find for living is that I take care of a bunch of stray cats. I also am a companion for my 80 year old mother, and I am a business partner for my brother, but those purposes seem hollow. It is mostly thinking about my duty to open several cans of Friskies in the mornings and evenings for the expectant faces of these stray cats - that is what I cling to in my internal debates about my life.

It seems to me that happiness is about ignoring the meaningless and impermanence of our accomplishments. A successful, high-achiever has no time to ponder the fact that nothing he or she does truly matters, and that person is happy as a result.

Feeling good about myself would help, but that isn't easy when I have failed so badly. I would need to learn to disregard the evaluation that society assigns to my life. A related thing would be goals, and again those goals would probably be things that society doesn't consider worthy goals (because society's worthy goals are not attainable anymore).

It is really difficult to do my work and chores each day when I must repeatedly expend my time and energy staring at the wall and trying to convince myself that I can still do a few good things in my life like opening cans of Friskies for the stray cats. I would wish to die, but I think about the stray cats not being fed and wondering where I am. Yet ultimately I can't feed these cats forever, and the cats can't live forever. There will be new cats, but probably I won't be there to help them.

Still it is better to suffer the shame of my life as a failure and to be able to help these cats in a small way for a temporary time. It is only for a limited time thankfully.

I am sorry for the long rambling post, but I don't think this type of thinking is normal. I have felt this way for years, but sometimes I wonder if I am going to snap. Theoretically it is worthwhile to feed stray cats, and I should overcome my ego-driven/society-driven feelings of shame and failure, but it is a challenge.

EDIT: I think a lot of this is about having social connections where a person feels valued by others.  Seeing the value that others see in you probably helps you feel valuable and meaningful and hopeful about tomorrow. Probably it is also important to have that feeling of value internalized so that is is not entirely dependant on the affirmations of others. A lot of this is probably chemistry in our brains too."
"I‚Äôm so lost and I have no place to call home.

I know this is a common feeling shared among many here in this subreddit, but this feeling has been so overwhelming for me these past few years and I feel like I‚Äôm not working towards any concrete goal in the future. I just want a simple thing- to have a good community of friends that makes a town/city a place to call home and good enough income to support myself with. I‚Äôve worked really hard to earn a spot in a university abroad along with an education grant so I can study my bachelor‚Äôs in a new country. That was my dream when I was younger. But as I am getting older I feel like I have less concrete goals on what I want to work towards in my future. My desires of having people and a place to call home seems very abstract for now. I have made friends in uni but I don‚Äôt even know if we‚Äôd be present in each other‚Äôs lives after our degrees as I don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôll end up- let alone be in the same country. Friendships I had before uni have fizzled out due to all of us going our own ways. And the country I‚Äôm a resident in (not the one where I‚Äôm studying abroad) doesn‚Äôt even feel like home anymore bc of a traumatic incident my ex inflicted on me before I left for uni which left deep emotional scars that won‚Äôt heal over quickly as I‚Äôm away for most times of the year. I also have a strained relationship and deep distrust with my parents who are the only people I return home to. The whole place feels so foreign to me now yet I haven‚Äôt established any roots elsewhere. Moreover, I have no community or other friends waiting for me whenever I return back home to my country. When I graduate I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs best to go back to the place I grew up in now as it feels so foreign to me because of past traumas or venture off to a new country I‚Äôve never been to. And I also know that making lifelong friends feels a lot harder the more we get older. Which is so saddening because deep down that‚Äôs all I want. I want lifelong friends whom I can be present with regularly and be there for each other and give that deeper sense of fulfillment in life. Right now I feel like I‚Äôm floating and I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt even list concrete reasons as to why I should keep going. Nothing feels like home, whenever I come back I remember what my ex did to me and I feel powerless at how he managed to make the place I grew up in feel so foreign but I‚Äôd also feel so lost and scared if I laid down my roots elsewhere. I‚Äôm genuinely at a loss. Let alone I don‚Äôt even think I have any lifelong friends. What‚Äôs all of this even for ?  What am I doing all of this for ?  I worked so hard and yet I don‚Äôt feel any better. I just feel lonelier.  There‚Äôs no place I can call home while I so desperately want one. That‚Äôs all I want. I want community, I want to feel safe, I want to feel loved and give love. I want to experience those simple joys in life with people I love by my side.

I know I‚Äôm not the first person to ever feel this way, and I surely won‚Äôt be the last. But if anyone has any advice or anything at all, please, I‚Äôm all ears. All of this adult stuff is scary, especially now that I feel like the foundation that built me up prior is crumbling down. I‚Äôm floating so helplessly. I‚Äôm so scared. "

"Hello wonderful people,

I have been on lexapro for a good 3 weeks now, and it has definitely helped me a lot. It removed a lot of my suicidal ideation and extreme anxiety, which was once making life unbearable, but yet I still feel a sense of depression. Nothing matters to me and I feel a sense of anhedonia. I don't necessarily want to kill myself but I just want to vanish completely. I don't know what to make of this, but I'm really tired of feeling this way. I have so many responsibilities and I cannot even get myself to do a lot of them because I just feel no motivation and no drive at all. I still feel this unpleasant void in my chest that nothing seems to fill. Considering just ending things but I am not suicidal enough to go through that again. A part of me wishes I never went to the hospital and just followed through like I planned to. Any advice? Please? "

I just wanted to know from any avoidant what their perspective is like.

How does it feel to express your emotions, what stops you?

Why would you rather lose a relationship rather than try to change?

If you‚Äôve been through this experience of being dumped because of it, do you regret how you acted? How long did it take for you to regret this?

I wish I can take my life away I am a waste of space and I have nothing to live for and I have nothing but failure . I thought about jumping in a river and taking 1000 pills . No I don't want attention no way and I don't want to kill myself. I thought about it but no way I won't kill myself.

I just wish I can have a happy life and succeed like some people. I am a very hard worker. I show up on time , I dress well, I bathe daily and I am very friendly with customers and my co workers and I worked at the same job at the movie theater for 10 years. Maybe I shouldn't be alive anymore. "
"So Its not uncommon for me to think about ways I would kill myself, how do have it not affect my family, etc. And then id think like ""lol I would never kill myself."" But the more I think of this the less I think its a joke on myself.

I think ive been in denial so long that I didnt relise that I actually want to leave. Its no secret that im overweight, I lost ten pounds and felt nothing. Granted the weight isnt what bothered me its the way I look. When I lost fat it was mostly from my arms and chest so im still fatass in the waist, stomach and thigh department. Im built like a sac of potatos lol. 

I got off track anywayd yeah so im starting to think maybe Im supposed to do this, i mean if im trying to improve myself and feel nothing maybe I wasnt meant to be anything. Ive never been popular and my height makes me stand out which I hate because of my previous reasons(6'3) . I hate it when people look at me, god I hate it so much i feel bad for everyone thats looked at me, ive probably ruined a couples peoples day jist by being there. 

I take the bus home and nobody ever sits beside me becuse I bleed a little into the next seat. God that's embarrassing. Dont even get me started on love holy crap thinking of that makes me anxious and nervous thats why I dont think of that anymore.. well try to its hard when the urge to yk... Is primal. Anyways took me a sec to put thst in words but it did reason with myself to actually think about suicide legitimately.

See you guys around, maybe lol"
"Is there anyone here who complains about or feels significant physical symptoms due to their mental state? 

My body shakes nonstop, and I can't stop worrying about it. 

It has been going for 8 years now, and I just don't know what to do. My whole body shakes, and now I isolated myself from everyone in order to hide my shaking body. 

I'm currently very socially isolated. And both my social isolation and unexplained tremors wreak havoc on my mental state, and I don't know which causes what. 

I'm living a nightmare, and I'd like some advice. "

any advice on things that can help me manage and maybe slowly improve? "
I always feel so bored. I have no motivation to do anything. Like everyday feels the exact same. I‚Äôm struggling so bad and I tell my fianc√© all the time and I feel bad that I put her through this. I feel empty and numb. I feel like I can not be happy and there‚Äôs no joy. But I don‚Äôt want to end my life. I want to be happy. So badly. 
"Good evening everyone, being depressed and having been under treatment for 9 months now, I still can't feel better.
Well, let's say that I go out a little more, I study, I have a few passions but I don't feel any better. There are days when I'm fine, and days when I'm unable to get up and do anything with my day and I feel guilty. I even break my commitments which reinforces my guilt. 
To be honest I feel like I'll never get out of this, like I have some sort of thing over my head that won't go away. Everyone I have spoken to has told me that I will get through this because I am young and my whole life is still ahead of me but I don't really believe their words. Talking about it makes me feel good, but as I don't know who to confide in, I come here, hoping that people understand me and can perhaps advise me?
Thanks for reading me."
"really just that, everything is so exhausting and ugly and pointless and hopless because i am alone*
and i have no clue how to change that. i also suck at nearly all things."
"It's currently 1:49 am.

I am 21 years old. I passed Highschool with an Adult Diploma by the skin of my teeth. I have never had a job. I only have two friends as of recently, but before then, my relationships have never been good. I am a virgin and have never been in a relationship. I live with my parents. I am not in college.

Eversince I was a child, I've had a hard time paying attention, studying, making friends, being productive, and controlling my emotions. All though my morels have changed over the years from scared Christian, to narcissist nihilist, and from late highschool to now, pessimistic misanthrope, my brain remains the same. I have been diagnosed with autism, adhd, depression, and an anxiety disorder. I suspect that I may also have brain damage. I have no skills in any field. Nor did I have any classes that I had excelled at. Even my hobbies, like games, writing, and art, I have no skills in.

I never practice anything, and when I try, my brain starts to hurt so much that I start crying. I have a mental breakdown from trying to practice tying my shoes, something I can't do properly. One time I tried to start a jigsaw puzzle, and I got under 5% of the way through and started to cry. Same thing with crossword puzzles. It's also hard for me to read books in an intelligent way.

I stay up at night wondering how I am going to improve myself. My mind, my body, everything. The anxiety of my past and future, keeping me awake.

How am I going to become a writer and artist if I can not practice? If I am not good? If I can not improve?

I have no qualifications to join a university. Nor do I have the money for it.

How do I improve my brain and mind to help with my intelligence,mental health, literacy, productivity, paying attention,improving, over stimulation, and controlling my emotions?"
"I lost my brother 8 months ago to cancer. I live in Australia alone, far from my family. Lately, I‚Äôve been living day by day without a purpose. I can‚Äôt find meaning or a sense of direction within myself, and it weighs on me. I have no goals, and I don‚Äôt know where to start again."
"Hello‚Ä¶ I am one week shy of being 25 and‚Ä¶. Let me tell you my story. 

I have 3 dogs, a toddler and a 4 year relationship with a man I love. The only important things I have left in my life. 

I want to end it all‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want help. I don‚Äôt want a number to call or text, just want to die. 

I want this world to suffer, without me. Like I‚Äôve had to do for years. 

I lost my dad around a month after my son was born. I lost my best friend‚Ä¶ my support system‚Ä¶ to alcohol. He drank himself to death.. 

My mother‚Ä¶ well she‚Äôs on the same path to killing herself. She won‚Äôt stop drinking, even though she watched her husband die from it, and forced her then 22 year old.. who had her own kid to take care of‚Ä¶ made her care for her father in the last month of his life. 
While said daughter has, heart failure.. and diabetes. Mother knows this‚Ä¶ and has told the daughter to her face‚Ä¶ ‚Äúif you didn‚Äôt have your kid I wouldn‚Äôt help.‚Äù She never wanted me. She‚Äôs made that clear since I was 11. She made it clear I‚Äôm such a burden to her‚Ä¶ 

We can‚Äôt even afford our bills when working 40-80 hours a week. We can‚Äôt afford living anymore‚Ä¶ I have a fucking toddler who I feel like I‚Äôm failing everyday. 

My 25th is in one week, and I have never felt this depressed before. 
Can‚Äôt afford to go out. My mother asked me even if she could skip my birthday celebration, bc she doesn‚Äôt want to see me. She asked if my son was going to be there, and I said ‚Äúmost likely his dad will be working so I‚Äôll have him‚Äù and she scoffed at me. Said to me over the phone ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt give a fuck about you guys. I wanna see my guy. I want to see my grandson.‚Äù Like ma‚Äôam. I am your daughter‚Ä¶. He wouldn‚Äôt be here if it wasn‚Äôt for me. 

I don‚Äôt feel okay anymore. I don‚Äôt want to live anymore. I don‚Äôt want my baby to ever feel this pain‚Ä¶ so what do I do? How do I cope? How do I‚Ä¶ make my mother love me again and stop drinking? 

Killing my self. Ending it all‚Ä¶ would solve 99.9% of my problems.


Why can‚Äôt I commit to it? Why can‚Äôt I just fucking get my head out my ass and do it? 

What am I scared of? I‚Äôll be dead any way. 
Maybe‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the thought of failing my son? Maybe it‚Äôs.. something else. 

I did get into consoling about 2-3 years ago when my dad passed to help.. it doesn‚Äôt help now. It doesn‚Äôt do anything for me. 

How do I feel okay again? How do‚Ä¶. I make myself not sad? Not depressed? How am I supposed to live, if I can‚Äôt even wake up and feel okay? 


So what is the point of living? What is the point of trying to continue my life, when we won‚Äôt succeed. We won‚Äôt make our rent next month, we won‚Äôt make anything next month. 
We won‚Äôt survive. My son is better off with someone else. My life is better off dead. "
I've been in a really dark area with my depression lately. I don't feel like I have any energy to do anything and talking with people has become harder. I am in therapy but things are just going slow. What are some ways to get out of this slump?
"My depression has been resurfacing recently.  I‚Äôm trying SO hard to combat it, but it‚Äôs tricky when I can‚Äôt seem to get out of bed until 1 or 2 pm.  This has been happening for a couple weeks. 

I want to leave this post as the last thing on my phone before going to bed.  And I‚Äôm hoping in the morning, that there will be comments encouraging me to get started on my day.  To go to class for the first time in weeks. Please I don‚Äôt know what else to do right now."
I've been in therapy for 2.5 years weekly. I'm currently on my 3rd antidepressant in that time frame. It isn't working either. What do I do?
"The dream wasn't even that great, still pretty realistic, just better in a couple important ways. Doctors were actually listening to me and I'd met a girl who I was spending time with, but then I wake up in real life where I have nothing or nobody going on and totally stuck in terms of treatment options"
"I'm so tired. I hear how bad, fucked up and useless i am all the time. I already made peace with the fact that I don't do anything and will never do any good for this world, but I can't stand being the target of laughs and gossip. I can't talk honestly to anyone, i have no one by my side. I'm always alone and have to deal with stuff all by myself.

I really want to run away somewhere and end it already. There's no point in waiting, every other day is much worse. I don't care if it's selfish or bad time, i want to rest. Needed to get it off my chest, i want to let someone know that I'm so sad and tired, not lazy. I wish someone would look at me and finally notice I'm not okay. I can't think of anything but dying. I really don't think i can take it much longer, my head really hurts."
"i physically cannot stop crying i just have this constant feeling of sadness, it only really stops when I‚Äôm my boyfriend but its even began to happen when I‚Äôm with him, which is scary because he was my only happy space. but o just cannot stop feeling sad it‚Äôs become my default emotion and i just cant feel better no matter what i try can someone please give me some real advice asap i really need it."
"So I‚Äôm 17 (F) and I‚Äôve been going to a new school and I‚Äôve been sh for a few months now and sometimes it‚Äôs better but at the same time it just gets worse. I‚Äôve got one male teacher which is really nice, and I feel like I could open up to him, but at the same time I feel bad because he organises pretty much stuff like IT work and our year-level. 

I‚Äôve been going to this school since august and I‚Äôve found some friends but I‚Äôm not comfortable talking to them about this stuff, neither my parents. Besides that I‚Äôm scared that if I would tell that teacher about my problems, that he would inform my parents about it."
"I‚Äôm a 24 yo man, I‚Äôm currently in a relationship and she‚Äôs the best thing to ever happen to me. My depression is making things hard on us. Tho I have this beautiful woman standing with me I feel so alone, I constantly feel low and I‚Äôm so embarrassed to be who I am. I hate the person I look at in the mirror. I ask myself why I feel like this, why I hate myself so much and I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm always fighting off suicidal thoughts and I‚Äôm just really tired of feeling like this. I just want to read some positive stuff, read some stories of people dealing with similar things and finding happiness. I‚Äôve been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember and I‚Äôm reaching my limit. I just want to feel happy"

"I‚Äôm just 19 years old, and I haven‚Äôt eaten normal food for a while. I‚Äôm so tired. I just want to disappear. It feels like the world is crashing down on me.

I can‚Äôt pay the rent, and I‚Äôm starving.

I used to have so much faith. I prayed to Allah, begging Him to take me away, to end this pain. Every morning, I wake up wishing I hadn‚Äôt. The weight of my debts is crushing me. I went to the masjid, hoping for help, but it was like I was a ghost. I feel like I‚Äôm already dead. I don‚Äôt deserve anything. My thoughts are racing, and I‚Äôve even prayed to Allah to give my good deeds to my mother. She doesn‚Äôt deserve to suffer because of me. I‚Äôm watching my life fall apart, and I can‚Äôt do anything to stop it.

I‚Äôve brought shame on my family. They can‚Äôt even look at me anymore. I don‚Äôt have a home. My parents used to take care of me, but now, my father has told me to leave. The rent is overdue, and I know the landlord is coming, but I don‚Äôt have the courage to face him. So I hide here in the masjid, praying for death, praying for peace.

I wish I never existed if anyone is willing to support please I would appreciate it pray for me"
"For context, I ended my spring semester of college early because of depression and anxiety related problems. My parents thought it would be a good idea to go back to school this fall at a community college. I hated it, I hate talking and interacting with people, and I stopped going to classes and doing the work. They didn't suspect anything until an official looking letter came in the mail last week, and I lied and said it was about event tickets. Another letter came and my mom opened it and now she knows. She's royally pissed, and keeps saying that she's a bad mom even though it's me that is the problem here. my dad is on his way home from work and I have no idea what is going to go down, because just yesterday I lied and told him I've been getting all my work done.

"Can you resist a depressive episode?

About one or two weeks ago, i started feeling much better, feeling hopeful, motivated, i got really active, had a pretty good sleep schedule. I‚Äôve had small periods where things got better before but i don‚Äôt remeber feeling so joyous and hopeful, I don‚Äôt know how, it just‚Ä¶ happened, on its own, like something had switched in my brain, and i genuinely thought things were starting to take a big turn for me, for a week i felt like a healthy person. 
About 3 days ago i caught a cold which sort of broke my momentum. I thought ""i‚Äôm proud of the week i just had, i‚Äôll just rest for 2-3 days, until the sickness goes away and then pick up where i left"" I was still feeling motivated to keep going as soon as my cold went away but today, it‚Äôs like i woke up fine and my state deteriorated through the day and i‚Äôm about to go to bed feeling like i have for the past 4-5 years. Really melancholic, moody, tired, i can feel that weird empty feeling in my chest and the weight of the rumination in my head.

I‚Äôm scared that this was all just another false hope, i‚Äôm scared of losing this power i had over my life, of losing motivation and hope of not being able to act on them, of having to wait another how many months for another chance. 

Be honest. 
Is there anything i can do to resist an episode if it is coming? Or do i just have to be patient and let it pass and hope it will be shorter this time ?"
"I am a loser. I always self sabotage my self. I am weak in many areas that are very important for my future and my growth. I am a college graduated, I do not have a job. I am not good in anything. I do not have a good body. I do not have good communication skill.

I want to become something in my life, other people are dependent on me. But I am a failure. I have this inner voice that say I will do something in my life, I will become something in my future. Due to this voice I take action sometime, but I never remain consistent for more than a week, and then I come back to point 0. It has become a loop now. I do not know what is happening. How can I come out for this. I do not how can I achieve something in my life."
"I 26f have been dealing with self harm and treatment resistant depression since 10 years old. I also have CPTSD and OCD.

Treatments that I've tried:
-12 years of therapy
-EMDR
-Hypnosis 
-Somatic therapies
-Group therapy
-Inpatient Treatments
-Intensive Outpatient Treatments
-Partial Hospitalization Programs
-20+ psychiatric medications (I had genesight testing done. Only 3 medications were compatible and I've tried them too.)
-Telemagnetic Stimulation Therapy (TMS) Neurostar
-Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) Bilateral for 1+ years. Probably between 60-70 treatments 
-Mushrooms (carefully picked strains) microdosed 0.1-0.5g every 2-3 days and trips 1.5-5g 

I have a hx of one suicide attempt in May of this year.

I also suffer from a multitude of chronic illnesses. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia (IST), Endometriosis, Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, Asthma, Factor IV Lieden (blood clotting disorder inactive only have 1st allele), and Interstitial Cystitis (IC).

I get terrible symptoms daily not only chronic pain but also presyncope, syncope, and adrenaline dumps. Plus a multitude of other random but somehow connected symptoms.

I spend my days just managing symptoms mental and physical. 

The only thing that ever gave me mental health relief was ECT. It took my depression from an 11 to a 0. Unfortunately I had to stop after a year due to insurance and increasingly alarming side effects. I now have terrible short term memory loss, I can't retain information I try to learn, brain fog, loss of concentration, and for lack of a better description a loss of my common sense. I am still experiencing these symptoms a year after stopping treatments.

I am at a loss for what to do next. I have considered ketamine infusions, nasal spray, or oral microdosing but I am worried about the cardiac effects. I am currently still microdosing mushrooms but if I do a full trip I have to be very careful to monitor my vitals and keep myself stable.

At this point I have looked into assisted death/suicide. 

Most doctors have deemed me a lost cause. My last therapist of 3-4 years dumped me bc she felt like she was taking my money without providing progress. My psychiatrist got increasingly annoyed and agitated over the years that I had not made progress and my PHQ-9 and GAD-7 have stayed consistently the same pretty much my whole life other than during the year of ECT. 

I implemented all the tools and coping skills and even tracked my use and how I felt they worked for my doctors.

I am on the hunt for a new psychiatrist and second opinion (more like 5th). Until then I'm hoping someone can share something I haven't tried or heard of.

If you stuck around to read to the end, thank you. I appreciate you."

"I'm 30 years old . I dont have guts and I'm afraid to speak my mind.  It's been like this for so long, but it wasn't always. The nail in the coffin was getting a massive and extremely visible tattoo that I don't even like because I was afraid of looking like an idiot (which makes no fucking sense).. I even remember thinking before getting the tattoo that I've got to speak up, I'm going to feel this way forever, but I just ignored it and now I can't get over this tattoo and I'm spiraling.

The tattoo is 2 months old and I'm seriously thinking of getting laser. It was such a dumb time to get a tattoo and I genuinely feel like I'll never bounce back again and I'm so afraid.

I've always struggled with self compassion but this time it's really fucking me up. People are even saying they can see a visible change in the way I look, I'm smoking almost a pack a day, like what the actual fuck.

"I'm 23 and always had some level of depression. I honestly can't even think of a time when I wasn't, including when I was very young. When I was younger I used to have this voice in my head. It would tell me ""no need to worry about the future because you will die before you become an adult"". It honestly gave me much comfort knowing all the pain I was going through will be over one day but the problem is. I never planned anything. I've lied to the adults in my life so they wouldn't know how depressed I was. Like saying I would go to college, I would become a photographer, own a studio one day. Stuff like that. Now I did go to college and graduated with my Bachelors in Applied Arts. But while in college that voice disappeared and ive always felt uneasy by it. 

I moved across the country (Canada. West to the East). I needed to get out of my home town and away from my family. But I also had to leave the only support system I had. My few friends who are great people and i do still talk to them. I don't regret moving and will never move back out West but I have no one here. Here physicallyto help and support me. Im trying to makes friends but its so much harder then i thought it would be. I'm completely on my own and learning how to survive. This is actually my second year being here and it has gotten better. I had to move about 4 times last here but finally in a good spot. I also had to switch jobs a few times to for multiple of reasons. I've had the one I'm with for just over a year but I hate it there. It's retail and I wasn't even given a chance to get a promotion after talking to my manager about it. My manager told me they were excited for me to apply for it but hired someone outside the company before I even gave my resume. I've been applying to new jobs. Especially ones that are related to the field I went to school for but it's so difficult. I can't seem to really get in. I want to try going on my own and following with my photography and I've tried in the past to learn about business but. Idk I just can't do it. I keep having thoughts of ""what is the point"" ""nothing is going to work out"" "" you don't have any real plans and you suck at figuring those things out"". I know I have to fight these thoughts but I have no idea how. I feel so helpless. I want to succeed but I don't know what the first step really is. I know there are so many videos that talk about that and I've watched a few of them but I just can't seem to apply it to my own. Idk what to do. It all seems pointless to me. I just want to make a good life for my cat and maybe me but it seems impossible. "

"i‚Äôm on 20 mg Lexapro. I have been in a bad headspace lately and cannot for the life of me remember if I have taken my meds. Is it worse to take a double dose accidentally or to take a lesser dose accidentally. I‚Äôm very desperate for help, thank you in advance.

"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my son. But sometimes I just miss my freedom and being able to get up and go without begging someone to watch him for me. I am a teen mother got pregnant at 16 had him at 17 and now 19. Never had support from his father, wasn‚Äôt even there when I had to have a c section to have him. He told me he hopes I get graped and I haven‚Äôt talked to him since.

When I found out I was pregnant I was terrified to tell anyone I hid it for 19 weeks. I wanted an abortion because I knew I wasn‚Äôt ready for a baby and knew he wasn‚Äôt gonna be a good father. But by that time it was way too far along for the pill. But they gave me the option of medical abortion but then showed me an ultrasound and I couldn‚Äôt do it! He already had a spine formed and I felt my family was going to disown me if I did have an abortion. I told my grandma not to tell anyone cause I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do yet and of course‚Ä¶ she told EVERYBODY.

I‚Äôm just so tired of being alone and want to leave in the most peaceful way possible but I‚Äôm going to feel so selfish. I never had neither of my parents growing up. Never knew my dads side of the family and barely know my moms side and always felt it was my fault. I don‚Äôt want my son feeling how I did. My mother passed due to domestic violence and my father has been in prison and I‚Äôve been living with my grandma since I was 13months old. I just feel so selfish that I brought an innocent child in this world knowing I wasn‚Äôt ready. I‚Äôm just so scared of raising a little boy for the rest of my life ALONE and don‚Äôt know what to do but I can‚Äôt take it anymore."
It‚Äôs not fair that I have to live in this world when I don‚Äôt want to. All I want is to leave the party early. I‚Äôve done tons of research on how to do it but it all seems so violent and I‚Äôm scared to suffer. Im so sick of living as a peasant on this planet. I‚Äôm here to work and that‚Äôs it. Can‚Äôt afford a family. To ugly for a SO. Buried in debt. Just please take me in my sleep. Make it easy for me. 
"I have an appt with my psychiatrist in a couple weeks to discuss going back on lexapro or hopefully a different medication that won't impact my restless legs.

I feel practically catatonic and it's been this way for several weeks. What are some practical things I could do every day to help me just get through the day, particularly the mornings? Even walking my block in the mornings feels very difficult. Thanks for any and all advice. For anyone experiencing something similar to me, you are not alone and I know we can get through this. "

"Recently my girlfriend broke up with me and I was absolutely destroyed, we were supposed to be together forever, we were perfect and best friends together. She broke up with me because of my problems so I took a week off of school to get my mind right...I went to a party after that week and was getting over things fine and accepted what had happened with a hope of maybe we could be together again. I got so drunk last night and I saw her with a guy at the party and being drunk I lashed out my pain and flipped her off and was being so disrespectful to her and even took a picture of her. I don't know what I was thinking and ruined any chance of her regretting what she did. I wanted to show her that I was fine and happy and have a good time but I did the fucking opposite and now she probably hates me and all of our mutual friends definitely do. That's not how I feel at all yet it came out. After that I got so fucking depressed and missed her even more I had to leave school. That night I lost my girlfriend forever, friends, and my semester at school with my friends. I'm now home thinking of her out having fun with other guys and how I ruined any chance of being with her it was cruel embarrassing. Being home thinking of this is the darkest place I have ever been and feel like killing myself is the only way I can escape this pain. I feel like I ruined my life and there is no point anymore. The only thing holding me back is how destroyed my parents would be. I thought we were gonna be together forever and I ruined any chance of that. I have never been so close to killing myself in my life. I just can't do this anymore. Everyone says it will get better but I feel like I don't even deserve that. I want to die and can't enjoy anything anymore. Should I do it?"

"hi, this is my first time posting, but i really am a bit stuck :)

I‚Äôve had depression since i was in 7th grade, and even though i do have a few close friends and a family who TRY to be supportive, it‚Äôs always been extremely difficult for me to talk about without bursting into tears or feeling stupid. so i try to keep it on the low.

i recently began a solo traveling journey supposed to last 4 weeks. just an experiment, and also, in my eyes, kind of more or less something to keep me from being in one place any longer, because the feeling of everything being the same is what starts drawing me to suicide ideation. 

anyway, i‚Äôve been traveling for a month now. hostels have been hard for me, because there‚Äôll be a few people i really enjoy being around, and then they‚Äôll leave and there‚Äôll be a period where i don‚Äôt like the people, or i just wanna be alone or with my real friends, or ill feel left out‚Ä¶. just anything. i‚Äôm now at a farm stay with a nice couple and their 2 young kids. and for some reason i really can‚Äôt help but constantly be on the verge of tears. you know, the usual what the fuck am i doing with my life, money anxiety, crippling loneliness, the feeling like im doing pointless things and running out of time, the feeling that i cant get close to anybody, that the cold here is isolating (im in the alps, and im from LA).

to make it worse i barely have wifi, and can‚Äôt really talk or family and friends. and i feel so ungrateful. i chose to do this and i don‚Äôt know why i thought this would be a magical solution. i didn‚Äôt, i just hoped it would be. i was bored when i was wandering around alone, i was annoyed when people from the hostel would wanna constantly be doing something, i was miserable in the heat in italy and now im miserable in the cold of the mountains. i don‚Äôt know what i want. i want someone who loves me to materialize and hold me forever, idk. i don‚Äôt wanna say i wanna go home but i do. for a day, and then come back. i can‚Äôt actually do that of course. and i‚Äôve never said this in my life but i want my mom and dad.

"I‚Äôm 23 now,and I feel real behind with things.Stuff like not being able to drive,having no close friend groups,and having a job.

I‚Äôve just been focusing on mental,and health stuff for the most part.Stuff like therapy,therapy groups,medications,and insurance help.I was volunteering for work experience,and starting to see a job counselor but put that stuff on the back burner.To get into intensive therapy right now because I never really saw one for trauma like I should have been.

How do you guys motivate yourself to get back into these big life skills too though?

I'm at the end of my rope. I can't get anything right. I can't make any lasting changes to fix myself. I don't get to see my son much because his mom took him out of state and doesn't talk to me. My other one is falling into depression because I am failing to be a positive figure for him. 

I screwed up every opportunity I had. I failed in the air force. Just 14 years of bullshit. Seeing things nobody should see, putting up with endless demeaning nonsense from leadership. Passed for opportunities, passed for promotion, just for doing my best and asking for help. 

I get VA benefits, and I thought it would be some relief because I can't hold a job as a civilian, but all it does is make people jealous and cause conflict in my relationship. Nobody understands why I am struggling to find work. Nobody cares. I don't get to relax and take time to breath and figure myself out. I'm just a lazy unmotivated piece of trash. I am here to be used as a punching bag. I can't bottle up my feelings but I can't let them out either because I'm feeling things wrong. I have to communicate more but I can't because I don't do it right. Everything I do is a failure. No body wants me to be happy. Nobody wants me around. Nobody wants me. I'm just done. Fuck all of this. 

The only thing keeping me alive is my kids. I want them to at least have a father, even if I'm only barely a human. "

"This is a genuine question. I don't mean to offend anyone with it. So, I apologise in advance if it does.

I've been depressed for so many years and I'm familiar with what self harm is, but I've never considered recurring to that (nor I will nor encourage doing so). I've slept for long periods of time, starved myself, isolated myself, etc, which could be considered self harm in a way, but I've never thought about causing myself physical direct harm with pointy or sharp objects.
I think the closest I've gotten to that is picking and pulling out my finger's skin and sometimes pulling out the whole toenail from my pinky finger when I am sad or overwhelmed of how shitty things are. I've been doing that for many years now, between other stuff.

I had a friend who used to self harm leaving lots of scars in her arms. This was before I've met her. After that, she never did it again.
It left me thinking, though, on how to help someone who does it.
I still don't understand why people do that kind  of self harm. Not that I judge. I just genuinely don't know nor can imagine why, and I want to know in order to empathise with someone who may need support.

Any help on understanding the subject will be dearly appreciated."
"I'm honestly in a state where I don't even know if life would ever turn good for me. I got physically and mentally abused by my own mom for two years straight, causing me to suffer with several issues growing up. My dad is abusive as well, a womanizer, and a total deadbeat. I feel unsafe in my own home due to the fact that he gets increasingly aggressive when he's drunk. I'm scared of him not only because of that but because he also has a mistress who's in her early twenties, I'm also the one who discovered his affair by seeing a message that he sent to his friend which he said, ""I prefer them younger, cause liking them makes me feel young again."" I'm horrified, and I never told my mom about that message's existence but I did tell her about him having an affair. 

My mental health is so messed up. My trust issues is so bad to the point that I made another account on every social media to act like I have a friend there and talk to them, knowing that I'm literally just having a conversation with myself, its because I feel like I can't trust anyone but myself, its because I feel like I only have myself. My abandonment issues too, I'm super scared of being left alone that I'd literally beg a toxic person to stay in my life. Daddy issues so bad that I started seeking comfort from older men online, though I know the dangers and consequences that comes with it. Please help me, I don't know what to do. 

Because of my mental health, my academic performance isn't doing so well. I'm literally failing. I'm super sensitive these days to the point that every little problem that adds to my stress, I'd think about harming myself and I don't wanna do that because I'm scared of hurting people around me. I told many teachers about my problems but all they ever said was, ‚ÄúIts a small problem, you'd get through it. ‚Äù 

I had started to think that its normal to think of unaliving yourself from time to time, but as I grow older, I just realize that I'm just mentally unstable. I thought it was normal to at least have more than 5 attempts in your early teenage years,but turns out it isn't. I'm also suffering physically because of how many times I've tried overdosing on pills. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm scared that I might actually end up dying, I'm too young to die. I'm only 14yrs. I just want all of my problems to go away. "

"Hello, I wanted to say the progress I had. 

A few days ago I posted here asking about how to improve personal hygiene during a very strong relapse. 

Yesterday I was finally able to detangle all my hair, it took me like 3 hours [and it hurt at times], but I could, It no longer looks like the hair of a stray dog. 

 I also took a shower and made a dentist appointment today [it will be Friday at 7pm, a little late, but a friend offered to accompany me]. My hair is somewhat damaged from the time it was neglected [nothing too serious], but it does make me a little sad, since my hair was very pretty. For this reason I plan to cut it, not much, just enough to start taking care of it again and to make its maintenance more manageable. 

Despite this, I am happy and today I have felt more cheerful and with a little more energy, perhaps at the end of the day I will tidy up my room a little. 

Thanks to the people who gave me advice and good wishes in my post and for dms"
"Does anyone else just get bored with life and obviously no enjoyment because of depression and you sleep to skip the time. Like sleeping will make the time go faster. I don‚Äôt really know how to get out of this. 

I‚Äôll be honest I have an antidepressant prescription next to me just waiting for me to take them I‚Äôve been off them for about a year now and thought it was time to try them again but I just want to prove to myself that I can do it myself. 

I just don‚Äôt know how. 
I have hobbies but I struggle to start them and if I do start them I get bored of them quickly. 

I keep thinking if I sleep enough it will just clean my brain and skip to a time where I will enjoy more things. Like I feel tired but no sleep is working.

"I've had depression, bad, since I was a kid. I was on lexapro for maybe 6 mo in 2013 or so and experienced happiness I didn't even know was possible. Problems seemed solvable. I had energy. I could sleep. I remember saying to my normie-brained friends ""if this is what not being depressed feels like why aren't ALL you motherfuckers the president??"" Like every single one of you should be president right now.""

Had to get off Lex for side effect reasons and current meds have stopped me from feeling like being born was a curse I never asked for but I've never been able to access that joy again. 

I just got through the worst of my first austistic burnout and another depressive episode is showing up right on its heels. I couldn't even string together a week of mental wellness. And I just thought, even if I make it through this, all that's waiting for me is *another* breakdown  and then another one after that.

I am usually good at knowing when my brain is lying to me during these episodes but... that just seems like a shitty, not worth living life.

I'm not going to do anything about it, but it sucks and I want to talk to the manager."
"Hello,
So suicide is pretty high in my family especially on the paternal grandfathers side. My grandfather recently committed suicide. We believe a big contributing reason. Is that he struggled to cope with the way the world is now. The world and society as a whole has changed so drastically since the world he grew up in and we all think he had a very difficult time coping with the way things are now, and the way things are evolving. 

Thing is I can relate to him. I don‚Äôt like the way the world is, I don‚Äôt like the way society is, I don‚Äôt like how advanced technology has become and how dependent everyone has become on it. I don‚Äôt like the political division. I don‚Äôt like how mean everyone is to one another. I was born in the ‚Äò90s and even I barely recognize the world. And obviously a lot less has changed in my 30 years than my grandpas 80. 

So I guess I‚Äôm worried that if I‚Äôm already feeling that way, how will that affect my mental health in the long term? I struggle with anxiety and a little bit of depression but up to this point have never really been suicidal. I‚Äôm just nervous cause if I feel this way already at 30."
"You all know how depression is. I am desperate to find the energy to exist and enjoy existing. In the past, working out has helped me find energy and feel better (even if briefly). I want to try to get back into that again to see if it helps, but it‚Äôs been so hard to find the motivation and energy to even begin. Every time I start trying to get myself to go to the gym, I get so filled with self hatred for letting this habit go and being so out of shape, and then it just makes it so much harder. It also doesn‚Äôt help that I despise working out, I just have always done it for the benefits but I hate every moment until it‚Äôs over, so it‚Äôs never something I actually WANT to do. 

For those who this might relate to, how do you find the motivation to do something that you don‚Äôt like just so that you can reap the benefits? How do you push through the chronic exhaustion to move around? How do you explore exercise to find something that you enjoy? It doesn‚Äôt help that I also have horrible social anxiety LOL so I only stick with what I know, which is the elliptical at the gym. How do you not let that self hatred override your motivation? It doesn‚Äôt fuel me, which I wish it does.

Maybe I just look at it wrong and it doesn‚Äôt mean anything but I really thought I was well liked at work and now I don‚Äôt think I am and they don‚Äôt care about me that much (as much as I care about them) and I‚Äôm just really upset that I started this day happy and proud that I got so far in life and ended up being sad and disappointed and crying at the end of the day. Sorry for the long rant but I hope someone understands. I‚Äôm really trying to be a good person, good colleague and good friend all the time and I just feel like no one feels the same towards me. Sorry again and thank you if you read this far. Also I‚Äôm from Germany so not a native speaker but I hope it all makes sense. "
"Hello, Reddit.
I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but I feel like I might have it to some extent. I've decided to follow my psychologist's advice and start exercising. He said that sports should help me feel better. The problem is, I'm not seeing any results - I'm not feeling better mentally, and I'm not seeing any changes in my body either. I just feel... nothing.
What am I doing wrong? (I'm exercising at home, not at a gym, if that matters.)"
"I broke up with him 3 months ago, but yesterday I saw him at a festival while I was with my friend. but after my friend left to go home cause he was drunk asf, I just walked around and just started crying at some bench cause I just remember I all again. 

So at the latter start of our relationship we tried sex while I was asleep to see if it was hot yk but like he just did it sometimes all thought the relationship and I was okay with it cause I hope he will stop sending girl dp‚Äôs and asking them for nudes. But he didn‚Äôt and I found out he just used me as a freaking pocket passy while he got nudes form random girls so I made it clear he freaking needs to stop touching my body while I‚Äôm sleeping BUT the night after I woke up to him doing it and I just wrapped me in two blanket and fall asleep again cause I was too tried and next day I packed my things but he got violated and took my phone, card and keys and locked himself up in his neighbor apartment. But at last I got all my stuff and left but Mby 1 week later I woke up to the same thing again and tried to move away like I was asleep still cause I didn‚Äôt wanted the same thing as last to happen to me but he just held me tight so I gave up and just tried to sleep through it. 
And every time I tried to text with him about it he will be mean asf or make fun of me. One time he said I probably like begin graped cause what I like doing sex???? 
This feeling hurts I was sooo happy in there‚Äôs 2-3 months after I broke up with him
What do I do???"
"Does anyone else feel like it‚Äôs so exhausting always trying to make yourself feel better/happier? I really feel like I‚Äôm at the point where I just want it all to stop, I feel like I‚Äôm losing the battle against depression and it‚Äôs consuming me. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore."
"I‚Äôm in a really bad place - health issues, my husband asked for separation to figure out what he wants (he‚Äôs not in a great place), not doing great at work and constantly worrying about the world around me. I‚Äôm devastated and I miss my spouse. I can‚Äôt eat and I can‚Äôt sleep. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm really struggling. I wake up and cry about my marriage, I randomly cry throughout the day and at night. I just want my old life back and for things to be better. Most importantly I want my spouse to decide to be with me as I‚Äôve made it clear that I‚Äôm committed to him. 

I am trying to lean on my friends and family but I feel like I‚Äôm burden to them. Things feel like they‚Äôll never get better. Please help me get through the day to day.

"I think im a bad person. A boring person. And a delusional person. I‚Äôve tried to start many interests and never make anything of it. I used to sing and be in a small band I used to always be creating art but now I‚Äôm just a husk. I‚Äôm in college(im21 üòû) and I don‚Äôt even really know what I‚Äôm doing, my gpa is lower than anyone else I know there and my professors just keep passing me for whatever reason. I don‚Äôt work to be where I am, It was given to me. Sure, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to work but I had opportunities and blew them. I never learned how to drive because I was too scared of being yelled at or that I would want to kill myself with the car or that I would just embarrass myself too much. That. I‚Äôm too embarrassed to do anything and don‚Äôt do it but everyone around me keeps tugging me along and I don‚Äôt know really what to do because I legitimately can‚Äôt stand talking to anybody because I‚Äôm ashamed of myself. Many people approach me because I dress ‚Äúcool‚Äù or seem cool and get told all these nice things I feel this gut wrenching feeling that I‚Äôve tricked this person into liking me. I avoid any meetups with potential friends because I don‚Äôt want to disappoint them, I don‚Äôt talk to family because of it, but in turn I just disappoint them more and I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so hard for me to do literally anything. But I have gone on dates, online dates, I hate that about myself. I‚Äôm so embarrassed but I still look for someone and I‚Äôve met the coolest people and had the weirdest dates that I thought was because of them but then I realized I had nothing, I was embarrassing myself by even thinking I had anything to offer this other person, and they probably picked up already on the unspoken queues. I‚Äôm obsessed with living in my own world but at the same time obsessing over every wrong thing I‚Äôve done in my life and not doing anything about it (things that take extended effort that involve active doing especially if there‚Äôs some way I can embarrass myself, I do try to fix immorality and the way I act) I feel like I care but sometimes I question if I really do. I feel like a poser and a fake, like I‚Äôm trying to be something I‚Äôm not even tho when I try to think of who I really am I can‚Äôt think of anything else besides a disgusting person who in actuality shouldn‚Äôt be wearing all this clothes and all this makeup , my room and music taste shouldn‚Äôt be what it is. I‚Äôm scared to die especially when I think the real implication of how it must feelbut I just wish I was never born. Even when I do build the courage and start doing things with my life any little mishap will throw me down a spiral. I feel like this is more of a rant, and I don‚Äôt expect anybody to respond because I know I‚Äôve said a lot but I was wondering if anybody had advice or any opinion about all of this. I used to be really good at comforting people with my same issues of depression but I feel like I don‚Äôt even understand what to do anymore, but I‚Äôm willing to be of mutual support."
"i am sorry we are here in this moment in time, and I wish I could make you feel better, just like I wish I did too, but I did felt companionship as sick as that thought is, thank you for being here and I'm sorry. please use your energy to companion people, don't say much maybe an upvote. i hope you have some relief tonite."
"I help manage my own depression/lack of motivation, and help others, by focusing on small daily achievements. 

For example, yesterday I had 3 items on my to-do list but I just felt like laying motionless on my couch. To help me get up and moving, I broke one of my tasks (personal hygiene routine) into a smaller piece by telling myself all I had to do was brush my teeth. 

This helped me get off the couch and into the flow of being productive. I quickly brushed my teeth and while I was standing in the bathroom, I decided to take off my clothes and get in the shower. 

  
It's the small daily accomplishments that help me manage my depression, reduce stress, and feel better about myself. I hope this can help others as well. "
"I just need to vent because I‚Äôm feeling really low right now.... sorry. Dating and y self esteem hace always been tough for me, but lately, it feels like it's getting even worse. I‚Äôve always been self-conscious about my height, but I try to stay positive and keep putting myself out there. But I'm just so tired of dating apps.  
 And then just now,  just now some guy felt the need to say I can't be a real woman and must be trans. I don't think there's nothing wrong with trans people but I know he means I don't look feminine because I'm tall.... I'm tired of hearing that ever since I went through puberty it has been the same............................. I hate it.

"Hey, if you‚Äôre here, thanks for reading. 

I‚Äôve been through some shit and I think it‚Äôs catching up to me. I don‚Äôt know how to cope or how to come out of it this time. 

No one cares for the full backstory, so the gist is this-
My dad died in 2013 when I was 18. My mom died when I was 21. And this year (28) my last close family member (maternal grandma) passed. 

I‚Äôve been battling depression since 2013 and gained 90lbs (eating is my coping mechanism). I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis last year at the age of 28. I took short term disability to help with the medication process, but ended up leaving the job I was at for 8 years. The job was very stressful and my boss was extremely toxic and demeaning. I should be happy I left, but I feel another sense of my identity gone. 

I was a daughter. I was a granddaughter. I was petite and healthy. I was a hard worker. 

Now I don‚Äôt know what I am. 

I live with my fianc√© and stepson (part time). I love them deeply and want to enjoy my world with them. But I am overcome with so much sadness or numbness often. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do to integrate back into society or how to handle feeling so isolated. Nobody my age understands hardly any of what I‚Äôm enduring and it‚Äôs extremely lonely. I try to get new jobs and new hobbies, but I quit them because I always end up back in the same despair. 

I am also (unofficially) autistic and get very stressed in new environments, overstimulated, and have various of those types of issues on top of everything. 

I almost just feel like there‚Äôs so much against me that there‚Äôs not any point fighting it anymore. "
I don't like people much but I don't wanna be alone either but I'd make a fool of myself if I tried to meet new people . I'm autistic and adhd and even with all the people on the internet coming out with thier relatable experiences I feel lonelier than ever . No one is hitting my phone  and it's fourth of July.  Noones asking me if I wanna come hang or anything.  I'm not a terrible person . I'm a happy bubbly person even so I barley have anyone to call my friends and even those people don't hang out with me unless it's convenient for them to do so . I'm 27 I have a kid . I want something or someone . I have no family I really am alone.  I feel very isolated .

"I have no body else to tell this to so I thought Reddit might be a good place to vent my embarrassment.
I'm embarrassed to even say I have no money to eat, I have no family, and my boyfriend passed 6 months ago, we have a young girl. I have no idea what I'm going to do for the rest of the month, I've been hand washing clothes to save money, I even had to sell his car and it's still not enough. I'm making my daughter random meals with what we have left in the house, ill have her leftover, this isn't how she should be growing up. I stole some pasta the other day and it feels like l've hit a new low. It is what it is, I feel so guilty wishing to be with him when I know she needs me but I don't know how much more I can keep up with this, the debt letters are piling up and l'm alone working part time to be able to look after her."
"I've been silently dealing with my own depression for awhile now. there were times where I wanted to end it all. I don't know how to reach out, I don't know how to talk about it. I've always made light of my situation since I understand that I'm better off than others. What convinced me to not end it all is looking forward to stupid little things that helps me get going. ""I can't die today, there's a new figurine coming out"" or ""It's a waste to end it today since I just cleaned my room."" My method of getting me to live through the week recently is anime. ""can't die yet, the next episode is on sunday"" things like that. I understand that it doesn't help my situation out. I'm still depressed and obsessively anxious. but it helps stave me off ending it all. you might ask what happens when you've completed what you're looking forward to? I find something else to obsess over and hang on. I think its best to keep doing what I'm doing until I'm ready to reach out. until then, I'll be holding on"
"I had a friend with whom I ended the friendship badly. I was in a bad mental place, and she said that I could always come to her, which I took literally. From one day to the next, she started ignoring me. At the time, I didn't know why. I tried to approach her face-to-face and ask if she could talk, to which she shouted ""NO"" in my face. I later found out it was because I was leaning on her too much, and it made her uncomfortable. I can see that now; I just wish she could have said it. We were at a folk high school together and had classes together, so it wasn‚Äôt like we didn‚Äôt see each other. I struggle a lot with anxiety, self-hatred, and depression, and this situation made it hard for me to open up to others, afraid they wouldn't tell me if it became too much or something.

A few weeks ago, I saw her in a TV series and had a panic attack. I did what I shouldn't have done. I wrote to her and asked if she harbors any hatred toward me, etc., and that I can't move on from this situation; I would like to put it behind me. I didn‚Äôt write this, but I'm just afraid she would start talking badly about me, and I can‚Äôt defend myself since I‚Äôm not a public person. I want to move on, but every time I see her, I get a panic attack, and the memories come back. The more famous she becomes, the more I will see her. What can I do? I'm in a dark hole with my thoughts."

TW: suicidal ideation (passive)

My mental health has somehow deteriorated even more. I'm miserable all the time.  I have no energy to even get out of bed,  nor do I have the desire.  I got blackout drunk on Monday because it was easier to not know who I was than to try and pretend that I was okay. I've been smoking more and more to escape and I just... don't see a point anymore.  I don't know why I'm even alive. 


I don't want to die,  or to kill myself,  but I also don't wanna exist either.  I'm just...  empty and numb. I hate it.

I was on meds for diagnosed bipolar II, but they stopped working and the therapist I was seeing just... disappeared(?) 

They said they'd call to schedule my next appointment,  never did,  and when I called back said they couldn't get me in for at least 3 months.   I'm looking for a new one, but the earliest I've been able to find is September."

"I don't like to share about my depression to those around me because I don't want to cause them depression.

40 y/o wife and mom of 3. I've always suffered from feeling down, maybe not full blown depression. Things have seemed to get worse after we bought our new house and I couldn't be home with my kids anymore. 

Now I have to work full time and I feel chronically tired and like I'm missing out on my family. I get up at 4, and work till 4, try to go to bed by 7:30, but I toss and turn. My job is pretty physical. A lot of days it's OK as long as I can zone out. But if I think about it too much I want to cry.

I crave down time, but then I get bored and don't know what to do. I nap a ton, but then don't want to wake up and face life. I don't want to do anything, but it makes it worse.

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, ptsd, and depression. I am on lamotrigine, latuda, and now ambien. My Dr just increased my latuda and said I should feel better in a week or two.

I feel like I just want to sleep or die.

I want to quit my job so badly, it's so hard to not walk off the job. I know I can cut down to part time somewhere, but we need to pay off debt first. 

We have 3 vehicles, 2 became non drive able within like 3 weeks of each other, so now we are borrowing a truck from a friend, we can't drive our car because it was declared totalled, (its drive-able but we arent allowed tl drive it) so we need to pay the rest of it off that insurance didnt pay. 

 Our ac unit went out and we had to buy a whole new one for 9 grand, so we are paying on that. 

We owe the irs 7,000 dollars. It's just 1 thing after another. I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I feel bad for unloading all of this. But I'm terrified because I had a very strong urge to off myself, and I don't want to do it. This was so exhausting to write and I'm sure it might get rejected because a lot of my posts on reddit do. 

I just wanted to vent. I go back to work tomorrow after the weekend. 

How can I feel better?? I need some help and advice. "

"Does anyone know a good way to explain to others 

certain things that happen in life: a loss of a loved one, breakup, family problem can cause a great amount of sadness and have you feeling extremely down , out of it, and sorrowful. 

This is not the same as depression. Can these events lead to depression? It‚Äôs very possible. However these situational circumstances bring those sad feelings which are valid pertaining to the situation. 

Depression isn‚Äôt the same as feeling sad over something in your life. For example I went through a breakup and I‚Äôm very heart broken and sad. But those feelings have nothing to do with my depression. It‚Äôs a whole seperate feeling that is not related to my situational sadness. It‚Äôs when days are great and I‚Äôm around my favorite things and favorite people and I still can not enjoy it. My mind is racing about not feeling myself, I want to lay in bed and just do nothing but what‚Äôs the point. Life feels purposeless in a way, although I know there is purpose - depression overpowers all of my normal feelings. Im on edge all day and go through the motions to get through it. Depression comes out of nowhere and. Even if everything in my life is GREAT, i feel so disconnected and bleh. "

These have made me question reality. ive been to a psychiatric inpatient hospital several times already. ive gone to therapy before though i cant get it to work pit for me. im seeking therapy still but my feelings are low. ive become the mosr unmotivated ive been i in my time. although ive reached out to those closest to me yet i go unheard or misunderstood due to my past self. i cant get myself to do anythng becsudr it a wastr. even writing this out is meaningless.  i cant get myself  to do more. 
"I have been struggling with low mood for quite a while now and I am starting to second guess my own emotions. My therapist said that I have previously shown symptoms of depression and self-harm, but don't know if I still have depression or if I am making it up in my head, my head just feels so clouded.

My first real suicidal thought was around 2013 when I was under exam stress and I have been having waves of it ever since. I have always had extremely low self-esteem and often compare myself to my friends, so much so that recently I have started to remove myself from their company because their happiness makes me feel worse about myself (it doesn't help that I have an unhealthy relationship to food and feel much heavier than them). I am happy that they are happy, but I feel resentment towards them because I don't know what that feels like. I have told one friend about how I am feeling but have only shared a little because I don't want to burden them with my feelings - they are going through their own issues. I tend to shut myself out from the world. I am an awful texter, days turn into weeks and I feel guilty for not responding, which leads to me avoiding messaging altogether and sometimes going months without a response. When I finally reply and share that I've been struggling, my friends are understanding, but I always think that they are just saying that and don't believe me. When I meet my friends, I am always bubbly and my 'usual' self.

I tend to joke around because I have grown up trying to make people laugh (an ex-people pleaser) so I fall into that mold whenever I am around them and other people. I get on well with my colleagues and am known to hide my stress. There are days where I have had breakdowns and no one would have known because I 'don't show it' and 'hide my stress well'. I joke around at work, am pleasant with everyone I meet and can sometimes forget how sad I really am. As soon as I get home the thoughts come back and I feel exhausted, depressed and alone. I go numb and question my importance. Where some can look up in the sky and be amazed at how vast space is, I look at it and remember how insignificant I actually am. I don't really want to be here anymore, but I feel that I can't leave my family. I have slowly started sharing things with my parents but cannot go into detail because I can see the pain in their eyes when I talk about it.

I have days where I am happy and things are going well. It can last sometimes for only an hour or for a few days up to a week. When my happiness lasts longer than expected I then second guess myself and question whether I really have depression, or if I have just made it up. But when I have a bad day or something 'small' goes wrong, I want to end it all. The things that used to make me happy don't. The songs I listen to just remind me of how much happier I used to be when I first heard them.

I just don't know anymore. Am I being dramatic or is something seriously wrong?"

I want my family back but deep down I know I‚Äôll never have that again. I don‚Äôt need much out of this life except for love, gratitude and respect in which I have none. They say know your worth but lately I‚Äôve been made to feel worthless. If you‚Äôre reading this please say a prayer for me. I don‚Äôt know how much more my heart can take üòî"
"My brother wants to move out with me, but for that to happen, i need to find work, so we both pay our share, i've tried looking and everything seems so terrifying, i've never really worked, i know that i need to take that leap if i want to change things. 
Im scared that i wont be able to handle it, that i'll just relapse more, it happened before. I tried to look for more at home work, but even that i can't, i end up losing the motivation before i can even get any skills for it. 
I dont even know how i'll explain the gaps all throughout my life in my resume
I really do want to work and be able to live, it'll really be great, i just, idk, sometime i wonder if im really trying my best or im just being lazy.

I‚Äôm very new to my battle with depression so there‚Äôs a lot I truly don‚Äôt know how to deal with. One of these things is my frequent loss of motivation and always thinking the worst in every scenario. I get motivated sometimes to try my hardest to stay motivated and positive but I feel any inconvenience even the smallest one I spiral. I know not every day can be a very positive one and there‚Äôs ups and downs but lately I feel most if not all days are negative and getting worse. For people who have had success with reframing your mindset and becoming motivated again in life what did you do?
"Hey guys, i noticed my mood is much better when suns out and felt like my depression was resolving. but lately its been approaching autumn/winter and my mood has been plummeting as of recently. What should i do? i get sick really easily from cold weather."
"I'm in the US military - Navy. I live on a ship and I loathe spending any more time there than necessary for work. 2023 was the worst year of my life; A couple serious suicide ideations and actual self harm. I was hospitalized twice for this, talked to a couple chaplains, two different DRCs, two psychologists attached to my ship and one not, and two healthcare workers. I've tried 3 antidepressants to no effect. I really don't want to be in the military anymore and I'm not scared of the effects of cutting ties early. However, seemingly, **they want to keep me in at all costs**...

I've made up my mind. I don't want to try more medications, I don't want to talk to more therapists who shove CBT down my throat, and I'm convinced I won't make any progress towards pulling me out of this metal coffin of a life I live until I get out of the military. I'll retry all of that when I'm out of the military if I can afford it, but I've lost hope in this situation.

So what the fuck am I supposed to do, quit? I can't! My contract says I have two more *hooyah* years! Yay! 

I'm afraid I'll give in to the intrusive thoughts and grip the throttle for the last time in my life, or drink myself into doing something else. Every day I just get off from work, sit in my truck death-scrolling, nap, and eat food until I have I go back to the ship and sleep. I don't want to go for a walk, I don't want to journal, I don't want to volunteer, I don't enjoy my hobbies anymore, and I'm starting to get tired of watching movies, videos, and browsing websites too.

I'm losing money every month, I'm losing my health, I'm losing time, and I'm losing hope. Please - what do I have to do so I can get the hell out of dodge?"
If anyone replies I will know someone cares. Please. 
"I am running into a problem that I‚Äôm hoping for some insight into. 

I‚Äôve seen therapists on and off for many years. I was unusual as a teen and began therapy then. 

But I felt after some time I wasn‚Äôt sitting in the presence of someone who could understand my dilemma. Mainly because I‚Äôm in the process of working it out. And so how can I really expect the therapist to assist me. 

While I recognise that therapy can serve many roles. I‚Äôve always been seeking it out to help me with very specific anxieties that I‚Äôve had trouble confronting. Things around socialising etc. 
but time and again I‚Äôve found that therapists have sought to box in my idea into their own framework rather than aiming to hear what my issue is. 
I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs probably me. I can be unclear in verbally explaining myself and get tongue tied. 
Now to be honest, I feel quite adamant that quitting therapy was the right thing to do. So I am not asking if I should go back to therapy. I might be not right away. 

What I am wondering is this. Could my depressive thinking be impacting my ability to express the troubles of my condition in therapy?

And if it is impacting my ability to express my challenges, how can I get help for my condition. 
By this I simply mean, depression tends to dull everything. I‚Äôve been living in it so long, it‚Äôs pervasive. And it‚Äôs only when I‚Äôm around other people that I can get excited or at least see them get excited. Notice contrast. Not just dull, anxiety, dull. "

I consider myself to be a person with greatly above average intelligence. I‚Äôve had pretty much nothing all my life, and spent the vast majority of my childhood locked in my room with nothing to to but think. I escaped into fantastical worlds, and became incredibly passionate about all forms of art. In fact, I even intend to make movies some day that I truly believe have what it takes to reach audiences worldwide. 

I underwent some of the worst trauma imaginable throughout my childhood. I mean no exaggeration when I say this- the circumstances I suffered were the type that you would hear about spawning serial killers and the like. But in my propensity towards philosophical thinking, I‚Äôve managed to tame my negative thoughts throughout the years. I understand what is necessary in most situations regarding emotional turmoil, and have centered a great deal of my adulthood around self-betterment. But for the first time, I have been confronted with my deepest wound that has remained suffocated by my other woes. As I‚Äôve worked past my other pains, this wound seemed to tear open when I was most vulnerable.

This is not a pain I can think my way out of. I am utterly lonely. I have never in my life known the love of a woman. Not from my mother or sister, not from a lover, not from anyone. I want to hold a woman and be held, and above all to be understood, but dating apps don‚Äôt seem to work for me, and I honestly have a fear of the outside. I was bullied all my life, and got used to being locked in a room, so of course I‚Äôm comofrtable indoors. And besides, there are things I want to do with my own time, I enjoy absorbing media that poses unique ideas for fantasy and writing, and drawing inspiration from them for my writing. I see no value in going outside, except that I might find any sort of love.

I can and will never find love just sitting in my room all day, and my heart aches worse and worse every single day. Just tonight I went for a walk around my city in the incredibly slim hope that I might have an immense stroke of luck and find someone who could love me.

All of my passion for art and desire for fame is being utterly drowned in the despairing sorrow of absolute loneliness. 

I feel truly hopeless, I can not find anyone. I dont think I can endure this loneliness any longer.

The hardest part is lnowing that no matter how much I talk about it, I will start tomorrow feeling the same way.

I genuinely feel like I‚Äôm dying."
"This doesn't happen often, but it did last night and I'd like to know why or if anyone has experience with it. Long story short I was friends with someone since child hood. 11 years old (I'm 26 now.) Her and I were inseparable. We tried dating at one point but agreed that we were better off as friends because dating felt weird. We were very close up until about 4 years ago, when she meet a guy and they got engaged blah blah blah. People get busy with life and I don't hold that against her. I'm engaged as well, and don't have much time. I invited her and her fiance to multiple events at our home, outings with friends, even just dinner, etc. They always had a reason they couldn't make it. I'm a firm believer in trying 4 or 5 times to be friends, but I just 100 percent give up after that. If I reach out and you don't put in any effort I let it and you go. I accepted that she wasn't a part of my life anymore a long time ago and basically never think about it. I dreamt about her last night and in my dream i looked at her and thought ""shes so pretty in my head."" she looked into my eyes and what felt like my soul and said thank you even though I didn't say it aloud. Then she said I looked sad. I woke up feeling incredibly depressed. Like at any moment I could lose it. I haven't cried in years. Not since my best friend was killed and I don't understand where this depression is coming from. Sorry for the book btw, but I was hoping someone could give some insight."
"I feel ashamed of being depressed. Yes my life is tough. The cost of living crisis (rent is increasing by 100 euro a month in June) and raising young children with no village, but why can I just not be depressed? I developed IBS due to the excessive stress and fatigue last November as well and the symptoms keep coming back because life is just too stressful."
"Hey friends,

I am writing this, because life has been so incredibly hard lately. I used to be someone that was SO optimistic, motivated, groovy, I knew what I wanted in life, and I have achieved so god damn much. Recently, about 6 months ago, something happened (I won't go in to detail because I don't have the energy), but since then, I have fallen into what has taken me a long time to label as depression. I never, ever, in my entirety of existence thought I'd be sitting here right now writing this, I always had the mindset: ""that will never happen to me."" And guess what, it did. I am stuck in this place where I do not think of self harm, and I have zero suicidal ideation, however, I also feel I quite often do not have any will to live. Life feels exhausting, and sometimes I just wish I could disappear without loved ones knowing, as I am surrounded by so many loving people and I'd do nothing to myself that would cause them hurt. 

I am basically in a state of constant anxiety due to the thought of a skin illness relapsing again, and the constant underlying depression of what that would look like living with this if it were to become significant again and/or progress, and how it would affect my life. (I'm not talking acne, even though this can also be debilitating). 

I guess I am just posting this to get my words out. Some key terms I can label of how I feel with all of this right now are: Depressed, hopeless, exhausted, frustrated, ""done"", discouraged, and lost in life. I have been debating calling my doctor and asking to try a low dose of **Wellbutrin/Bupropion**. I have heard good things about it, and that it has minimal side effects. Has anyone here tried it? If so, what was/is your experience like? It just feels like I can't move on, as I still have minor symptoms of what I went through originally, and it's like the disease is trying to fuck with my mind saying ""I'll always be here waiting for my moment."" I know that sounds stupid, but it's fucked me up emotionally. Badly. 

All thoughts, or just words of support are appreciated. &lt;3

I've given up on everything my life has been nothing but a string of failures the one thing I succeeded in doing was surviving cancer but other than that shit sucks I make mistake after mistake I'm a disappointment my parents ask why don't I go to them for help they make it impossible to ask wither they watch a show and if we interrupt they yell if their on their phones on Facebook they yell I can't fucking take it anymore and to top it off I've given up on school I was supposed to graduate in 2023 but instead I'm barley not going to now and if I fail they kick me out so what's the damn point I'm just boit ready to end it I don't care anymore my best friend won't answer his texts my brothers are busy my cousin I don't think cares if no ones here for me why should I still be here I think im gonna end it I'm tired

Do anybody have any idea what to do i am closer to losing it I just want advice  on what to do that's all . I am very sad I wish someone care. Thanks "
"Just as that says. I'm a dad, a husband, yet can't get anything right, can't have a career that is worth while for them. And any options for me cut me out of my child's life and leaving them disappointed. I'm seeing now that suicide might be best. At least that way it could leave them with money from insurance to grt situated. If at the very least open them up to have something or someone better come into their lives and give them what I can't. I just am seeing less and less a downside for all of it. "
My best friend basically ghosting me past few months. She only cares  about her new friends now. she said I have too much drama but when she  had no one else I was there. I guess she never was really my friend we  just known each other for so long. I'm hurt and I wish I didn't care cuz  shes shown she a shit person anyways.    
"This post goes to everyone that's struggling to keep everything clean at home - whether you live alone or with other people. I saw a post from someone here and, I honestly hope that it helps you too! 


**GIVE YOURSELF A WEEK** 


Divide your apartment or house into rooms or groups of rooms, depending on the size. Start with the room you want to clean the most first (that you're more motivated to clean) and then move on to the next ones as the days go by. At the end of a week, everything must be finished. 


Also, do this every month. If you clean regularly it will be easier and more pleasant to clean. 


If you can get some people to help you, it will be great for you all! Take the opportunity to chat. 
And give them a hand when they need help with cleaning too. They'll appreciate it a lot! 


**MINIMALIST** 


Become a minimalist and let go of everything that you don't need. Donate or sell and you'll find solutions to your current problems either way. If it is spiritual, you'll know that the people who got those items are making good use of it and you'll feel at peace; if it is financial, you can sell these items and pay off debts, or have money to pay for bills, or make an emergency fund. 


**PLAYLIST** 


Put some upbeat or relaxing songs to play. This will make the experience of cleaning interesting. You can dance around, pretend you're a singer or that you're singing with your favorite singers. Just have have through the process and you won't feel as overwhelmed anymore.

"I‚Äôve been having a mostly good day today. Took my bike out for the first time this year and rode 10 miles, went to one of my favorite breweries after, and made it home to cook dinner.
All seems great, but for some reason my mind is COMPLETELY clouded. I feel completely distracted and unable to put any focus or joy into anything. At all. Can‚Äôt seem to look up from my phone because it feels like a safe haven, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that isn‚Äôt helping either. 
I‚Äôm not miserable, but just completly down. Im sure it‚Äôll turn around eventually, but for now it‚Äôs a mess up there."
"I truly don't know what to do. Lately all I've been doing is hurting people with my actions. I feel like the worst person on earth and I truly might be. 

I never intended to - bad people never do of course. But I value kindness and the people in my life so much and I truly try to show my love in the best ways I know how. Yet I am harbinger of misery to everyone around me.

I've lost someone I thought was forever. I almost got fired - massively demoted for now, as their compensation. I am hated by many, including myself. I never wanted to be like this and I don't know what to do now."
"Would really love and appreciate your thoughts &amp; insights please üôè...

I feel like I suffer from Depression (MDD) and suicidality. It's been 10+ years like this with ebbs and flows here and there but it's gotten worse imo the past 5+ months. 

I feel deep down that I don't have it in me to get better üò¢ like, I don't feel deep down that I have the strength physically, emotionally and mentally.

For the past few months I think I tried to take solace in the idea and thought that hopefully therapy will help. At least hope for it. But then recently I really started having thoughts &amp; feelings of...what's the point? üíî no matter what or who you go to...it seems like at the end of the day it's really up to you to make that difference. But I don't feel like I have it in me to get better. And, that's made me feel more depressed imo. Like, as sad as it sounds I had this thought of that...it's cheaper to just...not be, instead of suffering through it and trying to get out of abuse for example. 

I was lucky enough to recieve a therapy call session recently and the although the lady therapist was really sharp &amp; professional and lovely - she was also imo really blunt with me and stated very bluntly that ""you have to fight for your life"". But again...what if I don't have it in me anymore? Again I am very grateful for the call session but feel sad deep down about all this.

Whatever it is that's missing feels deeper than just drive and motivation. I don't know what it is though but everyone seems to have it and I don't feel it in me anymore...

It doesn't help that I live in an abusive situation that I cannot get out of. 

I sincerely don't know what to do üò¢.."
"Hi

For context, I am a 21 year old guy. I'm pretty introverted and mostly like to keep to myself, both due to it simply being an aspect of my personality as well as a fairly significant bit of trauma.

I used to have such big dreams of becoming a scientist and making the world a better place. My interest was in physics and I went to college for a while before I just totally crashed. A fairly significant aspect of my trauma is related to homophobia - being queer in the Deep South is brutal as hell. Everything just kinda got to me over the span of a couple of months and I totally lost my drive. That, and the sheer expense of college was absolutely absurd. I wasn't willing to go into that kind of debt, even if everyone else was.

I went back home to my parents, and I've been here for almost two years now. I dont have the energy to keep a job, and I mostly just try to live for what little moments of happiness I happen to stumble upon. I have very few friends, mostly for logistical reasons (leaving college and... well people being who they are around here). My trauma is still very much present despite my life being more devoid of external stressors than it ever has been, albeit I am much more relaxed and comfortable.

I guess more than anything I'm just lonely. I dont really get along with my family and rarely see them even though we live together. We dont exactly hold... compatible views... I didnt really keep any of my friends from high school either, as I realized they weren't the best of people as I matured.

I've tried therapy a few times before but it didnt really help, likely due to the nature of folks around here. I was once in a conversation with someone who supposedly came highly recommended around here, and I happened to touch on my OCD. I told her that I had really awful intrusive thoughts regarding the nature of my morality and desires (something like that) and she responded with ""are you afraid you're a homosexual?"" Fuck man.

Sometimes I simply wish I could just fade into nothingness. I dont feel like anyone really cares about me, but at the same point I realize me uh... 'exiting the game' would really hurt people and I dont want to do that. I dont really know what I'm expecting by posting this here, I guess I hope for some kind of help but more than anything I guess I just kind of wanted to express the magnitude of my loneliness and anguish.

But yeah I guess thats about it... thanks for reading. I know its not likely but I hope you got something from this, whatever that may be."
"I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I am seeking help for severe anxiety and so far it‚Äôs been working quite well. But it feels like now that my anxiety is under control, my depression symptoms are getting bad again. And I‚Äôm jealous of everyone around me and it just makes me more depressed. I am 23 and have been struggling with getting a job. My older sibling is working on their career and it makes me wish I had stayed in school even though I know I wouldn‚Äôt have survived. But my younger sibling didn‚Äôt go to school and I get scared every time they leave the house with friends or to go to a job interview. I don‚Äôt have friends anymore and I don‚Äôt want my younger sibling to get a job before I do because I will just feel like the biggest failure ever and I already feel like that every day. But I want the best for my siblings at the same time. I also got my drivers license and no one in my household is willing to help me start learning to drive but I can‚Äôt afford driving school without a job. It just feels like an overwhelming cycle and every time I think about it I get so upset I just give up. I‚Äôve tried so hard to get better but I still feel like I‚Äôm so far behind and my goals will never be achievable. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore "
"I‚Äôve struggled with depression since middle school, and waking up in the morning has been a struggle since then. I hate it, it is by far the hardest and worst part of my day.

I feel rushed and exhausted every mornin. On the weekends I sleep until noon because of how tired I am. I usually go to bed early too, before 10:30 pm and I leave for work by 7am, so I think I get enough sleep most of the time. I‚Äôm not sure what is wrong with me or why I can‚Äôt get up.

"Hi, 33 M of South Asian Decent. I‚Äôll try to keep it short. I come from an immigrant, low income family. I was born in India, and I was there with my mom and 2 brothers until the age of 5. My father had moved to the US for a better opportunities and escape oppression. 

My parents are not educated, and so they really empathized to me that I need to be educated and set an example for the rest of the family and the future generations. When I was 7, one of my brothers committed suicide in India. I was always told that this was a car accident, but as I got older &amp; visited India I eventually figured it out. My surviving brother ended up moving to the US, but since he did not get a proper education in India the pressure was put on me even more to succeed and to take care of my family. I struggled through the years, worked jobs since I was a teenager to support myself through school. When I got to college I was diagnosed with depression. I took different medications and went to therapy for years and years. But nothing has really helped. 

I am now a dentist and working. I make good enough money to support myself and my family. But my career and patients often stress me out. I don‚Äôt feel fulfilled and I feel like I have lost my willpower to advance further in my career. It is a tough job and all I hear most of the time is complaining from patients and how much they hate seeing the dentist.

My family have a lot of issues between each other and I am asked to help them but they don‚Äôt even listen to me. It‚Äôs more just them complaining to me, asking for advice and then not taking it. 

I feel like I have gone through so much of my life to set myself up for happiness and success but I have not been experiencing it. 

My depression and anxiety weighs on me so much. I have been trying to exercise, meditate/pray, go to group/individual therapy, &amp; keep busy as well as rest/relax. I have lost joy of doing the things I used to enjoy. Time is just passing by. I don‚Äôt remember what being happy feels like.

Has anyone experienced depression that was medication resistant? 

Any ideas on what else I can do? "
"Hey.  


Me M(30+) have big issue with depression and controlling my emotions.   
I told about my feelings (love) towards my friend over 10 years and we both agreed that we never will be anything.  This made me ofc feel sad, but glad that we talked about it and we can now move forward as friends. 

We have some history together, but we tried get past it. 

I asked for some time to kill my feelings towards her and it was settled...  
As you might guess it weren't. I had my other closest friend coming to visit me and well... they hooked up and did some kissing and being close each other next to me (Tried to hide it but lol... Drunk peole ain't quiet when they try kiss). 

It hurt me... ALOT. Both knew my feelings towards the friend and I were hosting them at my apartment. I had to go away from them and went for other place to sleep night over. 

Wanted break from both of the friends and asked them leave spare keys to me. As seeing them felt really bad and I was angry towards myself and feeling really disappointed towards both of my friends.  


What i should do?   
I want them to be happy if they are happy together, but it feels like they had 0% respect of my feelings or towards me at all. 

They are pretty much my only friends as Im introvert and really shy around people. I don't want to lose either of my friends, but I cant look them to the eyes currently.   


I have medication for ADD and depression already."
"I've never made a reddit post about, this stuff before so I'm sorry if it's shitty. I'm venting here because I don't know what else to do anymore. I've vented to some people, my boyfriend mostly because he understands me most but I don't want to keep burdening him. He says I'm not but, I feel like I am, for so many reasons. But anyways. For shitty context, my dad passed away 2 years ago. I had a big exam at school that was on the deaths anniversary and it worried me because the date always, brings back the memories yk? Anyways, I tried dealing with it, and ended up getting a 94 on said exam. I felt, good. Things were going well. I was making it to school everyday. I was talking with friends. I was doing hobbies and self care and yk. And then it got, bad? Really bad. I feel, really bad. I struggle to regulate emotions and, I was doing well but, it got so bad. I get so angry or sad or just overwhelmed in general now. I currently haven't been to school in a week. And the one time I did go it was a random Wednesday, I missed the days prior and following. I havent been going, I haven't been doing work, I haven't wanted to do any hobbies, I can't text back anyone, only my boyfriend and even then I'm dry as fuck when like this. I don't know what to do, I know I struggle with depression, I know it gets bad sometimes but it's so bad and I don't know why. I was getting better. And now I cry and have anxiety attacks and feel so bad that I'm worried I'm gonna hurt or, end myself. I had an attempt in November, and I'm worried I'm gonna try again and I cant say this to anyone because I'll worry them. My body physically hurts, just existing is painful now. My brain feels like it's burning, I'm dissocating alot or having derealization whichever one makes you zone out and nothing feels real. I either feel so shitty and miserable or I feel empty and numb and like there's no reason for me to live anymore. I'm exhausted. I want it to stop. I need it to stop. I don't know how to make it stop. I'm writing this in a dentist office while my mom has her appointment. I feel pathetic. None of this feels real. This office doesn't feel real. I don't even know why I'm typing this. Please help. At this point I'd do anything to make this stop, I don't care what anymore "
"I wake up and no one's messaged me first. During the day no one engages in conversation with me unless I do. All the people I care about just wait for me to come to them. I could dissappear rn and they wouldn't notice for days. I ask to spend time with them and theres always some excuse. I try to make myself useful in peoples lives but they still dont really care if theyre without me. I wish it didn't matter so much to me, but I want to be seen and chosen and noticed so so much. I want to be the first thing on someone's mind. I feel like not existing anymore to avoid this pain and loneliness. Idk why I'm so insignificant "
"About three years ago I tried to kill myself by overdosing on antidepressants and various other medications such as painkillers, antibiotics, analgesics, and pretty much everything I could find. I was rushed to the hospital and was about five minutes away from death. Instead, I ended up in a coma. When I woke up, I couldn't remember what had happened. I was told what happened that night, but I can't remember it myself. After I was discharged from the hospital, I was sent to a psychiatric hospital because my family didn't know how to deal with me. I stayed there for three months, and there's a lot that I can't remember about that either. Most people tell me that it's normal and that I should ""move on"", but I can't. Something about not being able to remember makes me anxious and it's eating me up. I have the same issue with most part of my childhood, and it took a long time to come to terms with that. But this, I just know there's something I need to remember, and I can't stop thinking about it. But if I don't, I can't move on and heal, and that hurts. Sucks to be an overthinker."
"Hello everyone, I will try to keep it quick.
I am soon to be 29 years old, male and I have a auto immune sickness that attacks by now both my knees, my left shoulder and partially my spine. My left arm can't lift heavy things, I walk with a limp and on bad days I have a hunch.
I never had a girlfriend, my professional carreer is on a dead end after I burnt myself out with high stress work I did for prestige because I felt worthless.


I have gotten to the point were I don't leave my bed when I have a day off, there is literally nothing left that really brings me joy.

-Love: Done, almost 30 years old with no relationship experience, ugly and disabled. What woman in their right mind wants this??

-Hobbies/Interests: I do my best to enjoy things, but things are rarely fun to me anymore. And I don't see any reason in living just for the sake of ""I need to see this movie/play this game that comes out next year.""


I won't go and kill myself now, but I really don't see a point in me existing. I am a joke of a human, I worry some of us are just born to lose and die. I often think about nature, the disabled animals get killed first by predators. Maybe that would have been my fate, on bad days I regret not drowning as a kid when I almost did.


Thank you for reading my stupid rant."
"I‚Äôm waking up everyday trying to find a reason to live. It‚Äôs not easy being lonely, sad and having everyone turn their backs on you. Some that I‚Äôve helped, most I‚Äôve done no wrong to. In my time of need there‚Äôs no one I can count on. Everyone is ignoring me when I ask for help‚Ä¶but I was there and went out of my way to help them. I took care of some of them when no one showed up for them. What is wrong with me? Why do people keep hating me and ghosting me? 

I can‚Äôt find a job and I spend most of my energy doing that. What sort of bad luck do I carry? Where‚Äôs God in all of this? I‚Äôm tired of trying. I‚Äôm really tired. At this point I‚Äôm just using all my strength to try live to next hour but it‚Äôs hard. What am I living for? Honestly no one would care if I died. No one would look for me if my life ended today. They‚Äôd probably smell my body then want to breakdown the door. I‚Äôm struggling. I really am. Mentally, financially, emotionally and spiritually. Why me? "
"I have been depressed 2 decades, but only last 5 I have been loosing my ability to exercise in the gym or walk longer distancies. I don't get feel good hormones, I get ache during and after, ans my mood crashes for several days.

I have gained weight due to this, so changing it is even harder. I used to go to the gym but it seems impossible now. I walk my dogs but only small walks.

I have been moderately depressed due CPTSD, but went to serious last year and got hospitalized. During this time my body went from bad to worse, there is this stiffnes. I was on ketamine, didn't help.

Any experiences?"
I get really depressed sometimes and just give up and eat candy or things like that. I need help with what to eat while depressed. Sometimes I just have no energy to make meals either. 
"I suffer from rapid depressions resulting from trauma, rarely lasting a few months. Today I was fine, but now I feel like I've reached the end of my life. Depression has an unmistakable symptom: I feel like a boulder on my stomach and lungs, as if I'm on the ground with it on me."
"There's nobody left for me to talk to. There never really was. There's people that would miss me but they refuse to talk to me.

I can't handle this anymore. I haven't had a real conversation in months I've hungout with someone once since 2022 and they didn't even give me a chance to talk about myself they just vented the whole time and I'm there for them I know they needed it but so did I.

I was an unsocialized autistic kid I didn't start socializing till highschool and by then it was too late. I ruined almost all my friendships while learning how to socialize. I don't blame them I was hard to deal with. I don't know if I've changed because I haven't been close enough with someone since to find out. I think I'm finally the person they needed me to be. But everyone is already gone.

I've been wanting to share songs I've found and talk about them for years, it's my biggest desire and I haven't been able to do it.

I don't want to be rich

I don't want hella friends

I don't want to date anyone

I just want a single conversation but that's too much to ask for too.

What's even the point of doing anything when you return to an empty home everyday, I have nobody to share my joys with, nobody to bear my sorrows with me. 

I've felt hollow all my life. If I do find a friend will there even be anything left of me.

I've never known what it's like to walk into a room and have someone look happy that I was there

I never went to any school dances I've hardly ever hung out with anyone I didn't go to prom I couldn't afford a letterman jacket for all my sports patches, I didn't have anything everyone else had. 

There's one single person who seems to care that I exist but they have everything that I don't and it's hard to not be envious, they don't even really talk to me they just talk about themselves and go about their day. 

I've never truly felt loved my parents treated me like I was a punishment because I was diagnosed with ADHD and I've never had a best friend. 

These connections that I've never had are what makes us human, no amount of therapy replaces friendship, I've tried so hard but it's all for the nothing I've always had. I have nothing left to give I don't know how much longer I can go on like this

I tried to make friends in school and I try to make friends online but nothing has worked

I just want to talk about music, but that would require having someone to talk to

I don't know what it feels like to be loved, and I don't think I ever will. "
"i literally can't function normally. i wake up, i'm usually shaky, i hate eating, eating makes me feel sick, i hate talking to people, and the ones i do like talking to won't talk to me or are bad people, i don't have real hobbies, and i'm bad at the one thing i do ‚Äì playing videogames. i waste all my money on them too to feel something.

is it really fine for me to keep living like this?? i have no purpose, i have no motivation and my brain is rotting or something. i can't believe some people just wake up everyday and feel delight"
"Objectively I know I have it good. Job, flat, a few great friends, the works.
Yes, life's been especially shit lately - been through a shitty breakup,  lost a parent, ... 
 But I recently realised I think it's been a while since I actually *wanted* to live, even before all that. 
The idea of needing to continue to exist seems incredibly exhausting. And I can't seem to find reasons to want to work on things getting better, except for the fact that I know that me being here matters to others. Which is reason enough to me. I just think it would be easier if I wanted things to get better for myself. Do more than just exist? 
So, if anyone's got some insight on finding your will to live I'll (happily) take them, I guess."
"To keep it brief my anxiety and depression lead to dental hygiene neglect, I have not had a dentist since I was a young child. I really want to improve myself and go to a dentist but the idea of finding a dentist is overwhelming, I don't know what kind of information they need, if a dental history I have no clue where to get it. And I'm pretty confident I'll be lectured and scolded for the current state of my teeth, I've no doubt cavities will be the least of my worries.  But can anyone help walk me through how to get started?  Would I be requesting an exam or would a cleaning be good enough and they'll bring up problems as they see them? Bonus points if the process can be handled in part online.  But just peeking at some of the websites for local dentists it doesn't look it. Thanks in advance."
"I think that‚Äôs the word.
I‚Äôm 24 now and I‚Äôve never amounted to anything.
I finished school and went to uni.
I dropped out twice and wasted years.
I then became something like an intern or an apprentice and just recently got fired from my apprenticeship.
I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to tell the people in my life that I‚Äôve been fired, that I‚Äôve failed yet again.

Recently i went out to a bar for drinks that i couldn‚Äôt afford with some friends.
Along came a female friend of mine that I‚Äôve known for years.
I‚Äôve had a crush on her for over two years now but never told her because i was afraid of losing her as a friend.
I loved her, and maybe still do but it‚Äôs hard to tell these days as my emotions got really dull these last few months.
As the night went on the group started talking about our futures and how far we‚Äôve come.
I always hate that topic, i get anxious and try to change it.
While talking the female friend said to me: ‚ÄûYou know i always thought you were a bit of a loser but I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre working hard now‚Äú.
She was laughing and i think that maybe she meant it somewhat jokingly.
I tried to force a smile but man that was rough, she didn‚Äôt even know that i got fired and if she did she‚Äôd think of me as a loser.
The girl i like called me a loser basically.
I made up an excuse soon after and left.
When home i couldn‚Äôt even cry, i decided to abuse some drugs and alcohol and i passed out at some point.

These last few months were pretty rough. 
I can‚Äôt sleep at all. I skip some nights and only sleep a few hours in others.
I lie awake in my bed for hours staring at the ceiling. Yesterday i woke up after a single hour and couldn‚Äôt get back to sleep.
I‚Äôm having nightmares.
Im tossing and turning and i can‚Äôt sleep.
I stopped eating too.
I eat maybe a fifth of what i would eat normally.
I‚Äôm extremely anxious and panic quickly.
Whenever I‚Äôm alone with my thoughts i think about suicide.
I‚Äôm contemplating suicide heavily recently.
I‚Äôm broke too because I‚Äôm jobless.
Life is crumbling around me and it‚Äôs all because of me.
My self-sabotaging is finally showing results.
I‚Äôm tired and i don‚Äôt want to try anymore.
I‚Äôm not sure if I ever really tried anyway.
Not sure if i ever wanted to succeed.

My time is up, this is it. What a pathetic end.
You reap what you sow i guess.

Sorry if this is incoherent. I never was good at writing longer texts and english isn‚Äôt my first language."
"I‚Äôve been in a severe depressive state since 2019. I‚Äôve been hospitalized and I‚Äôve done a partial hospitalization program as well as three intensive outpatient programs. I‚Äôve tried dozens of different meds and I even did transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. Nothing is working.

A big source of misery was my job so I found a new one which I actually really like. I‚Äôm happier about that, but I still feel so depressed. 

I was with someone for 7.5 years and we got engaged but she left me a month later and I think my depression was the biggest part of that. I just never want to do anything.

I‚Äôm tired of wasting my life. I‚Äôm either working, sleeping, or laying on the couch. I can get myself to watch TV but that‚Äôs pretty much it. On the weekends, I just lay around. I need to clean and do errands but I find it nearly impossible so I‚Äôm always living in a messy apartment and eating poorly- I know neither help. 

I‚Äôm tired of living this way. I need to do better and I need to feel better but I have no desire, motivation, or energy. 

I know I need to just force myself to do things but it feels impossible. I get the same advice all the time‚Ä¶ go for walks, exercise, journal, do yoga. I just can‚Äôt and I‚Äôm giving up."
Just because things are not working out the way you want them to or because you feel like you are not doing anything productive does not mean that you don‚Äôt have value. You have value and you just are not utilizing your potential yet.
"i (16F) opened up to my mother in november about my suicidal thoughts and my self harming tendencies, and asked to speak with a professional about my symptoms and try to get a diagnosis and treatment. this backfired massively, she yelled and degraded me for hours, confiscated my phone, and forbid me from leaving the living room that night. i ended up in the emergency room the next day. i was there for a long time, i spoke to a psychiatrist over the phone and explained the specific thoughts i was having, how often, how severe, every detail imaginable.

i was discharged not to long after the end of that call. i was not given any information about anything discussed nor how the situation would be handled. my father told me a few days later that they were trying to get the insurance to approve me for counseling. i was relieved to hear it, i thought i was finally getting help. things were going to get better, i wasn‚Äôt doomed.

the psychiatrist spoke to my mother. i was not present for the conversation. i can only assume she was asked about my mental health from her point of view (which would not be an accurate account, as she hadn‚Äôt noticed anything in the year leading up to coming clean to her), and afterwards i was getting notifications that i was being signed up for a mail-in prescription company. i was confused, i hadn‚Äôt spoken to anyone since the emergency room. 

they prescribed me birth control. to treat my depression. i did not get counseling. i was prescribed tri-lo estarylla, which has if anything made my depression worse while also causing physical side effects that screw with my daily life. 

my mental state has severely declined since starting this birth control. just a few nights ago i called my boyfriend crying and begging him to stay on call with me until i calmed down. i did not mention to him that it was because i had planned to kill myself but decided to back out and wanted to be kept from doing anything stupid. 

i do not believe that i am being taken seriously. i think my mother has convinced everyone that i am just a hormonal teenager who is mentally sound and just dramatic.

i still have to complete another month of birth control before mom will let me come off of it and consider something else. i do not think that help is waiting for me when the month ends. 

is it standard practice to have a ‚Äútrial period‚Äù of birth control to see if your hormones are the issue? or am i not being treated correctly and should have been getting some other form of treatment? 

tldr; i suspect i have depression and am being disregarded. wondering if it‚Äôs normal to be treated with birth control initially."
"i‚Äôve been tremendously struggling with my depression recently and have been thinking about my suicide plan for days.

i‚Äôve gotten admitted to the hospital and had to stay overnight but there wasn‚Äôt really any advice or tips on how to deal with what‚Äôs going on in my head.

i would so greatly appreciate any tips or advice in dealing with debilitating depression and suicidal thoughts ü©∑"
"Hi, everyone I like to share a small childhood incident. I remember I was around 10-12 years I moved to New place and there I became friends with everyone like girls and boys gang. One day morning I was playing badminton with building boys they were age of 13 or 14 years old (. All of them were good and we use to get together we'll even our parents known each other.). On that day my father left for office and he knew I had went down to play, still he scolded me to go up home and stop playing, when I reached home my mother hit me with badminton racket, asked me to stop playing. I was an average in studies (though my parents. knew about this still they never supported for any extra curricular activities).

After this incidents I started hiding things and it became a bad habit of mine. During school day I used to talk to guy who were older than me, my class teacher use to complaint about this behaviour to my parents during PTA and honestly I was beaten by cooking utensils. One time I had called a guy friend over at house when my parents were not at home and I tried to hide him and got caught. I was severely punished. After years I was locked up at home and didn't had any freedom to roam or mingle with others.

Since then I have trauma of mingle with people. This is only because of that one incident, I became executive introvert and less motivated in life.

Now I want to be transparent and accept my flaws I want to be open up with my expression just like now I don't want to feel guilty and regret.

Today I have a good job and loving person my boyfriend I want to introduce him to my parents and start a fresh life with him.

I'm sharing this please don't hate me for my foolish Ness, I want your suggestion to remove away this toxic bad habit of hiding things from others. I want to change my life. Thankyou."
Does anyone else indulge in self harming activities just to take them 'closer' towards achieving a certain goal? In my final year of uni I deliberately decided not to study and fail in hopes that the feeling of failure would give me enough motivation to kill myself. I also didn't apply to any masters or any jobs deliberately so I could feel so hopeless that I would want to end it. I deleted all my contacts and stopped socializing with anyone just locked myself up in my house hoping that the social isolation would give me enough motivation to kill myself. I stopped caring about my health like not going go physiotherapy despite having constant back pains in hoping that the pain would eventually get so overwhelming that killing myself would be easier. Silly question but is this kind of behaviour normal or common? Am I just an idiot? Should I kill myself already and save everyone the trouble? P.S. I have actually tried to kill myself many times before but have never been successful - maybe I'm making it harder than it seems but I'm finding it not to easy to kms.
" It's sad how there are people who need advice, help, or anything- but their posts never reach the light of day.

"I have been severly depressed for 11 years since I was 12 years old. I was bullied and socially rejected/excluded in school which completely destroyed me. I am a shell of a human being I am a zombie. I tried college but it didn't go well. I have tried various therapists and medications but nothing has helped my psychoatrist says I have ""treatment-resistant depression"" (and anxiety). I have no will to fight. The therapists I have seen have recommended coping strategies like breathing, stretching, thinking positive thoughts, challenging negative thoughts, exercise, changing diet, going for walking doing something I enjoy to distract myself and  there is probably more that I can't think of at the moment. I told one therapist about the bullying and she just told me to get over it since the bullies have moved on and they arent thinking about me...I try everyday to move on and be have and have strength but nothing is working/helping. (I suspect that I have autism) I have reached out to some people for support but they just say things like make sure you get a good meal and go for a walk and my dad says ""don't worry you will be fine"" I feel like they dont understand how serious my situation is. I'm at a loss, I am at the end of my rope and at this point I can't think of any solution other than killing myself. Can anyone share something specific that can actually help me? Has anyone gone through a similar situation and actually healed?"
"My worse fear about seeking help has always been being locked up in a mental institution. 

Welp, 2024 I decided I could no longer live under a rock and decided to reach out to a Psychiatrist (I had a referral from my PCP to see one). 

Well, tell me why the first thing the Psychiatrist did was ask me ¬´¬†Do you have thought about killing yourself?¬†¬ª I replied ¬´¬†Yes, sometimes but my medication helps a bit with it and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm seeing you. I need to change my medication to help.¬†¬ª and he replies ¬´¬†Let me ask you again because if you answer yes, I‚Äôm sending you to the hospital right now. Do you have thought of killing yourself?!¬†¬ª I lied and said ¬´¬†No I don‚Äôt¬†¬ª and then he proceeds to talk about medications without asking much more information. 

Ohh and thought the entire time, he kept eating a cookie and an energy drink and shaking his right leg. Gave me anxiety the entire time. Oh on top of that, he wants to see me again in two weeks. No thanks, never again. 

I‚Äôll just live under a rock."
"For me it‚Äôs: grandparents passing, school being over, not being able to get spark back I used to have, fianc√© laying out his terms, dad having depression, feeling useless overall"
"I've just lived on the knowledge that I'll kill myself within the next year or two (for 7 years) so I've dug myself into this hole where I haven't dealt with anything (medical, job, ambition, saving money). I'm so stupid. I still live with my mum even though I'm 19, turning 20 this year. I'm such a burden on everyone, I'd rather kill myself than become a pathetic disgrace. All my friends are back where I used to live, I have no one here. I'm so lonely all the time. I hate myself more and more each day. I hate what I feel myself becoming. I can't do this to the people I love anymore, I can't keep leeching off my mum. I tried to kill my self last week but was too much of a coward to actually do it. So worthless. Don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I don't have a place in this world, but I'm too fucking frightened to actually end it."
"I‚Äôve been on anti depressants and medication for my BPD for a year and I don‚Äôt see a lot of progress. I am just a little bit more calm but I still get intense waves of sadness and impulsive moments that I do.

My fam is also one of the causes of my anger and depression so I can‚Äôt talk to them about it. If anything they make it worse. My mom just denies I have it and my fathers comments make it worse. He‚Äôs told my sibling he worries about my future and calling me a failure just because I failed one class at university last year. I don‚Äôt have any significant connections in my life either, never had a boyfriend or a real first kiss and my first sexual experience was traumatic.

"I‚Äôm 16f and I since i‚Äôm not old enough to buy my drinks I usually drink my parents alcohol or friends etc. I have hella anxiety and my depression has gone to shit since my religious mum took away my antidepressants (said they make me not believe in god and stop praying üíÄ). 

Whenever I drink alcohol (idk how much is considered not much or too much but like‚Äî say 3 shots of vodka or so) I finally feel like i‚Äôm able to walk around and be less stressed, more focused and less jittery, not so heavy and able to actually do the things I enjoy and talk to people with more confidence (not much but definitely better). I do feel like it‚Äôs a shit way to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù myself get ‚Äúbetter‚Äù but my god is it a relief when i‚Äôve got some in my system. I still feel like I‚Äôm a bad person for thinking this way though, so someone help me out."
"I find that energy drinks temporarily lift my mood and give me the energy and focus I need to do things (for example jobs around the house, tasks in my job). Coffee also tends to help me, but usually the stronger coffee you get from cafes. 

Without these, my mood is just so flat and I struggle to function. The truth is that I didn't really function well before I started drinking them as a teenager. In a way they're maybe a sticking plaster over whatever is causing me to struggle to function.

Of course, one issue with caffeine is that it can lead to increased anxiety."
You are welcome.

I need to search for jobs but I have been delaying it for quite a while now. I haven‚Äôt even made my resume yet. I feel very sleepy and tired all the time. I literally just want to wait and let things get worse, so that I can end my life. I‚Äôm constantly having thoughts of ending my life to be more specific I have thoughts of burning my own body or pouring Acid all over me. Most times I find it very difficult to control myself to not act upon these thoughts. I‚Äôm exhausted every single day.

"I've been considering suicide for a few years now. Slowly over the last decade I've lost friends, family and relationships. Yes I've made some honest mistakes, I left my last serious girlfriend cause I 'thought I was doing her a favor - I didn't love her, and she was pushing a boulder up a hill if you know what I mean. She was one of the most thoughtful peoople I've ever been with and my family and friends thought it was one of my biggest mistakes ever. I was never passionate about her so, I'm not in agreement, obviously. But quality relationships are so important.

I've slowly been pulling back from people for years now due to depression (I think), the Covid pandemic seems to have sealed the deal. I have less than a handful of friends who still reach out to me, a few work professionals from my last long term job (laid off from due to covid and the company needing to 'optimize' their financials prior to IPO). I've worked for almost a year in the interim for another company that didn't work out (micromanagement is a fucking nightmare). I don't know how to get back to my 'normal' life.

Normal was cycling, skiing and mountain biking (health issues killed back in 2017) going out to club nights, camping, wheeling, hanging with your peeps, dating...all that.

I don't know how to save my life. I have chronic pain, combining with pretty heavy depression that I can't manage with working out any more makes daily life difficult or impossible some days. I'm not yonng anymore. I feel like I could give good advice to someone else about different ideas and ways to solve this but I don't know how to get the 'train' moving in the right direction again for myself.

I'm fast losing hope again, frankly suicide seems like a way better way to end my life than poor on the streets. I've got a place now but the bank isn't going to give a shit when I run out of money. I'm starting to spend time thinking I have to hurry up, get my shit together enough so I can effectively plan and execute my suicide and get it over with successfully before I can't do it in a mostly painless way. I don't have any dependants so no responsibilities there.

I don't know what to do....all the years and shit I've used to make it through in the past (therapy, medication, church, self-help courses and classes, exercise, self-medication) don't help or aren't available to me any longer. I feel like the world would be better off without me. I don't want to bother anyone with my problems, we all have our own."

I want to give up and stop trying, but people keep telling me I‚Äôm strong and to keep going. I don‚Äôt have the strength. 

I don‚Äôt have plans to hurt myself. All I want to do is lay in bed and hope I go in my sleep."

"My mom got cheated on by her boyfriend of 16 years. He didn‚Äôt even bother breaking up with her, he just went and married someone else without even bothering to let her know. Ever since she found out she‚Äôs been depressed, aggressive, and obsessive. Everyday all day and night she sits on the couch and watches tv. And she just checks his ex‚Äôs and his wife‚Äôs social media constantly. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs living their life vicariously through their social media‚Ä¶ She doesn‚Äôt work anymore. She doesn‚Äôt even clean the house. She cooks sometimes if she forces herself. She showers maybe once or twice a week. She sits in dirty clothes until it‚Äôs time to shower. When I tell her she gotta shake this off and start doing something she starts yelling and crying. And I can‚Äôt get her to see a therapist. Even the word of it makes her start pulling her hair. It‚Äôs been almost a year like this. Please help me help her. I don‚Äôt know what to do."
"‚ö†Ô∏èPSA:‚ö†Ô∏è
There‚Äôs no such thing as being behind in life or being behind in society‚Ä¶the only things along those lines that are real are social constructs, societal bias and comformity, generational trauma, closed-mindedness, desperation for validation from other people, the illusion of superiority in the form of unnecessary, unwanted, and unasked for judgement, the fear the government specifically designs to control the people to get more money and power, peer pressure, and unhealthy perfectionism. Don‚Äôt be a sheep, allow yourself to be a unique, beautifully imperfect human‚Ä¶life has no set schedule or manual, so stop comparing yourself to others. Don‚Äôt be afraid to be different or go against the societal/social norm. Learn to be okay with being controversial, and unlearn society‚Äôs unrealistic standards. You‚Äôre uniquely you. It‚Äôs not your job to keep everyone else happy. However it is your job to keep your peace and to do what‚Äôs best for your life, your plans, and your mental health‚Ä¶even if it upsets people. You‚Äôre worth it. Stop caring about what other people think of you and other people‚Äôs opinions‚Ä¶they‚Äôre just that, opinions. It‚Äôs time to stop fearing other people, they‚Äôre only human, just like you, with their own flaws and challenges and personal hells to go through. If something doesn‚Äôt affect you, just shut up about it and don‚Äôt butt into other people‚Äôs business. It‚Äôs not your life, it‚Äôs theirs, and you‚Äôre not them. And to incorrectly assume you know exactly what someone might be going through or what it‚Äôll take to cut them into one of society‚Äôs boring, sheep, conformist cookies, is just so wrong and sad and pathetic on so many levels. Again, you‚Äôre not them, you‚Äôre not in their mind, you‚Äôre not in their situation, so shut up about things you know nothing about, doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre friends or family. It‚Äôll just make things worse if you judge and assume. And things you say literally have the ability to stick with people and rewire their brains and change their brain chemistry, so don‚Äôt be the reason people start thinking that they‚Äôre not enough or even the reason they start considering unaliving themself. Be the opposite. Perfection doesn‚Äôt and will never exist, no matter what society says. Fuck society and their unrealistic, engineered standards. Don‚Äôt add to society‚Äôs toxicity, half of them don‚Äôt deserve the time of day. Your imperfections are beautiful.

"2-3 years ago I fell into a deep depression, didn‚Äôt have any friends tried to kms a few times but I didn‚Äôt have the balls to do it.  About a year later old friend hits me up tell him about how it‚Äôs going and he helps me with my depression. To make it short made lots of friends became pretty popular and have a nice physique, that was everything what I wanted 3 years ago. I thought that my depression would be gone by now but it‚Äôs not and I really have no idea what to do and where to go because those were really my only goals, and a few months ago I felt really deep into my depression again. Please help me"

"I'm bipolar and have been in a depressive episode for the past 4 years, which is by far the longest episode in my life. I take meds but I don't do anything beside that because I don't see any sense in it. Meds help get rid of the negative feelings, but my biggest issue is anhedonia. I have absolutely no desire to do anything and I find nothing interesting, so I do nothing all day. 

Is anhedonia treatable? If so, how?"
"I am a very depressed person and no one knows. It is really odd, like I‚Äôm living in another world when I‚Äôm by myself and that I am living two different lives. I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore.

A little background, I have a good job in finance and on the outset, you can never tell I am depressed. I work, get stuff done, and am able to support my family. Come nighttime, I drink excessively. At the moment, I am working from home so I am frequently alone. I‚Äôm not kidding when I say I barely get up from the bed. I work from my bed. I order takeout and eat on my bed. I clean up enough that my husband does not complain. What really took me out is the fact that I have only taken one shower a week, on average. My hair has become matted and dirty. I feel so disgusting. I do to therapy, I think it helps, and I take Wellbutrin. That one definitely helped. However I still feel like I‚Äôm so unwell. I stopped caring for my hygiene. I don‚Äôt care if the house is dirty. The only motivation I have for tidying up are my kids. 

Don‚Äôt even get me start on parenting. I feel like my kids could do so much better. Yes, I take care of them, feed them, I show them love, but I feel like I am not engaging enough. I have become so dependent on the tv to keep them entertained, I buy many toys so they have something else to do and don‚Äôt pester me. I lay down most of the time when my kids are home. It‚Äôs embarassing. I am afraid that they will grow up and find that I am a fraud.

I don‚Äôt know why I posted this, except that I feel so alone. Once my kids are adults and move out, what now? It just feels so hopeless."
My mom is really really depressed right now and could use a distraction. I noticed she typically enjoys games on her tablet and I was thinking maybe she would use my switch. I was wondering if there are any games proven to help distract and take your mind off things. Anything anyone can suggest?
"hi there. making this post mostly to make a check-in. back before thanksgiving it became very difficult for me to get in touch with my prescriber. i would call and call but they never picked up. i left messages, but they did not call me back. for more than a month it seemed like they had just closed up shop and didn't notify anyone. 

i ran out of my meds, couldn't get a refill. it's been more than a month now. i have an appointment in early january with a new provider. by then it will have been almost two months since i ran out. 

i'm doing okay. i've been eating fairly well, better than normal, to be honest. i've got some exercise in. haven't had too many 'blue' days or been super irritable like i sometimes get. 

part of me hopes that the new dr. will want to leave me off the meds and see how it goes. guess i'll have to wait and see.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, the onset and progression of depression often have a lot to do with my current situation. It might stem from worries or be a result of those worries not being resolved.

So, I'm going to ask a pretty clich√© question: Do you guys think money can improve your depressive state? If so, how much would it take?

I'm thinking, if the answer is ""YES,"" does that mean it's a viable goal? At least for a while, treating myself like a robot, just studying and working, might help soothe the broken pieces of my real self.

Or, if money can improve things, does that mean we're not completely lost in real life?

If the answer is ""NO,"" do you know what you're actually lacking in your life? Is it that you have everything you need? Or have you become an empty shell? (Right?)"
"and Is it really possible? it seems so fucking hard to not have some sort of mind altering substance/experience. 

So. I label myself as mainly an alcoholic though i‚Äôm a polydrug user (legal highs, illegal, anything i can get my hands on to feel different). I want to believe alcohol is my problem drug and can still have fun. proved myself wrong with benzos. but i still have a special place for stims. i feel like they actually actively improve my life and make me productive and happy with minimal side effects. i can handle taking therapeutic doses of stims consistently and not going overboard. should i seek a pharma script to use responsibly which ive proven i can do. or am i delusional? why do i need to do anything to feel different. is it possible to do completely sober because it seems so hopeless unless i have stims or somthing to make me happy productive, content. make life bearable. but i hear over and over complete abstinence is the only way for someone like me to remain a productive member of society. any ideas, suggestions support or inspiration would be so appreciated. feeling hopeless. thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è"
" I feel like my greatest talent in life is to constantly fail at everything. Sometimes I just ruin things that are otherwise perfect. I want to stop but I don't know how. Here are just a few screw ups of mine listed below:

1. Failed to submit graduate thesis on time (6 months overdue now) and will likely get kicked out if I can't convince the faculty to reinstate me on grounds of my mental health.
2. I always procrastinate and hate myself for not starting work sooner. I sighed up for a certification course and exam and had one year from when I signed up to write the exam. I am now writing that exam at the end of this year and a few days before my eligibility period expires. This month I finally decided to start studying....but I only started studying last week and wasted so much time for nothing when I could have been practicing instead of cramming now.
3. I think I have a drinking problem because whenever I'm at a party there is a 50-50 chance I will end up passed out. It happened at my birthday a year back (which traumatized my partner as she had never taken care of a drunk person vomiting all over himself before), my friend's baby shower last month, and again during a Christmas party where I had her parents meet my extended family. And this time I completely vomited in their car and according to my partner, seeing me in this state made her parents cry (I think they felt helpless to help me)

With regards to the last one, I can't stop thinking about what my partner said, that no matter what opportunities come my way, I will sabotage it and that I'm completely self destructive in my life. She isn't wrong. I tried therapy but after a while it felt like we were going in circles and it didn't help (maybe she wasn't a good fit for me). I started taking antidepressants but I'm realizing that doesn't magically make things better. I'm still the same and still screwing up all the time. I have a psychiatrist appointment set up in February 2024 but I don't know what to do in the meantime. How do I fix my life. Can I even fix it? Part of me feels like this is what I deserve and since I feel like I have no value, I don't deserve to be happy (I think this is related to my neglect and abuse as a child from my parents). But I really don't want to be this way. I'm sitting in my office trying not to cry b/c I feel so pathetic right now. I think the part that hurt the worst is when my partner told me all the good work I was doing to make up for vomiting at my bday was undone in that moment and she can't picture having a family with me (b/c of my problems). It really hit home that if I continue on this downward trajectory, one day I will be left alone with nothing.

Anyways Idk if anyone has any helpful words but it means a lot if anyone just responds at all."
"19F I'm so very tired. I feel like nothing will ever go right for me and I'm just ready to give up at this point. Been homeless since the beginning of summer. Nothing's changed. Couldn't go to college, can't find a job, can't find housing. I tried so hard to get assistance, to get help. Medicaid expires on the 31st, so I can't even get help with my mental or physical health anymore. There's literally nothing I can do. I'm done. I'm so done with this life. I kept asking for advice trying to get help. I don't want to give up but it feels like I have to. I guess this rant is honestly my last cry for help. Any and all advice is appreciated!"
"I've been coping with treatment-resistant depression for a long time now.

I used to rely on my hobbies to get through depression but I am unable to enjoy my hobbies anymore. My depression got worse.

I don't know what to do.

I'm working with my psychiatrist and therapist about this but I am very impatient.

I'm tired of being depressed."
"The sad truth

The sad truth is, nobody is efter going to know the real me and the truth behind why I am the way I am and act.
I once felt like I meant something to the world. 
Like people were there for me and cared.

I was happy, but it didn't last long.
Nights of overthinking, mind drowning in thoughts wondering why everything switched
What did I do wrong that caused all of this never ending loop of pain?

Am I worthless?
Nothing?
Non-existent?
Just an option for people when they have nobody?

I think to myself.
am I the problem?
What if I was just gone?
Would anybody care?

I am tired.
But if I where to disappear, I would be selfish.
I won't be able to check up on people, see how they're doing.
Even though things aren't going well for me.
That's just who I am.

I want to feel loved.
cared for.
And just like I mean something.
Is that to much to ask for?"
"I'm also experiencing depression today because I believe I already lose in life, I have a broken family, other relatives don't care about me, and everytime I look in the mirror I wanna cry because life is unfair, why ugly people like me don't deserve to be loved? And I'm not a bad person, I don't do drugs, liquor's, smoke, I'm generous, humble , but sometimes I question myself what's good anyway for being a good person? When I was suffering my whole life .
I've read something about this religion ""Buddhism"" that they practice of removing emotions, self desire and suffering by achieving nirvana,. Like the shaolin monks they are all free from human and material attachments. And by it I want to be one of them too that doesn't care anything about looks, other people , and no desire at all, just meditating in a temple at peace. I want to be free of this suffering!!!"
"I'm 28 and I'm so depressed about my life not being how I want it. I'm stuck in a dead end job doing hospitality work because I feel like I can't get a job doing anything else. I have no education because my family didn't support me in getting any when they wanted me to take over the family business instead. I also don't know what I want to do with my life so I ended up doing nothing for years helping family out and I only been working in the last 2 years. I waste my money on things I don't even need because I'm fed up with my life and spending money is the only thing that cheers me up, I have no hobbies because I feel like what's the point if I never get anything out of them.

I have no friends and I can't make friends either.
I can't meet anyone that I can't get a boyfriend too, I feel like no one likes me and no one wants me in their life. I tried dating apps but the guys on the apps are always what I wasn't expecting of them when I met up with them. I don't know where to meet people either but when I do, nothing works out for me with whoever I meet.

I only have my parents and my brother and I can't ever have anyone else in my life as it feels like me and my family are the only people in the world.

I live in spain and it feels like there's even no opportunities unlike back in England to meet people and there's only jobs in hospitality in spain for the English, even though I speak Spanish. 

I've been taking anti depressants to keep me sane trying to put me in a better mindset to sort my life out and I'd be positive trying and trying and when I keep failing I now feel negative and I don't want to try anymore when I feel like I'm getting nowhere with my life. I always feel too depressed to do literally anything and when I feel like something finally good happens, it goes the next day and I'm back to having nothing going on for me.

People my age have children, getting married or have travelled the world and I'm so jealous of them. I feel like I won't have children if I don't meet anyone ever and the thought kills me and I'm crying about my life, it hurts because I'm a pretty woman too."
"Please, no judgment myself and my mom have that department covered. I am going through a very nasty rough patch. I have a special needs child is in no programs and not on any medication and I am doing EVERYTHING on my own. I can't even work anymore because being his mom is too demanding and employers do not understand or care.

Since my son was aged out of the program he was in, my life has been a spiral. I cannot deal with his behavior issues and I can't turn to anyone for help because in my state there are no available programs he can get into (age/school hours/staffing) so I am doing even more work than ever before. 

And the place it hit the worst, is my cleaning my apartment. My mom has OCD so you'd think I'd be just as bad. No it's the exact opposite I'm close to hoarder like disgusting. No moldy food but I got that way a few months back. My kitchen sink smells like mold and I have gnats. My kitchen is littered with playdoh pieces, toys, other bits of clutter that can be trash. He has toys everywhere. Soda bottles, some empty most not are all over, dirty clothes all over. Clean clothes never get hung up. Bedroom is no better save for the bed. Even my tvs are gross. My son got into some makeup and smeared it on my dresser and TV. His bedroom is way worse. Cat litter rarely gets scooped but I change it twice a month.

Even my car is no better. Fast food trash everywhere.

I don't cook anymore. Couldn't safely navigate my kitchen if I tried though.

My mom is coming to inspect my home on the 22nd and I will never get my place picked up enough in time and it's keeping me up at night.

I've tried everything. I'm on meds. My therapist is no help, just tries to medicate problems away. Never let's me unload or try to discuss solutions...

I'm broken at this point and my son deserves better. But I'm at my wits end..."
"Background- I had what I'll call ID (implosion day) back March '23, but looking back I'd been struggling since at least the previous September '22. In May '23 my partner got a dream job offer across the world and I knew I couldn't return to my workplace (a key cause), so she took the job and we moved. I was hoping the move would give me more purpose/motivation/inspiration but it's probably made me struggle more- I have no close friends here (not any friends back home I feel comfortable talking about mental health with, nor do I fell they'd be much help), I haven't found my way into any of my hobbies here yet, don't speak the language, and it's grey and rainy all the time (I come from a very sunny location).  We're down to one income, so I feel guilty spending any money on more than just essentials.

I don't want to be a burden on anyone that is dealing with their own issues.

My partner is battling with navigating health issues in a new healthcare system and having struggles finding her way at a new job, my parents are losing their home, my brother is a know it all, I only speak to my sister a handful of times a year.

I was always the independent do-er/fixer type, and now I can't even pick a psychologist to make an appointment. Taking the dog for a walk can be a struggle. I have so much free time but achieve nothing with it.

I absolutely dread the question
""What did you get up to today?""/""What have you been doing with your time?"" It just make me feel so guilty and ashamed, but the next day I still can't initiate doing anything significant.

Another question that I struggle with is ""Are the meds helping?"" Some days I feel like they mess with my cognitive abilities (or is that just the depression?) other days I can be a little better, so are they helping then, or am I just having a less severe day?

I just want to be a normal, functioning, adult again, but here I am just feeling worthless. How do I turn the corner?"
"I've been unemployed for a while. Got an interview, one after hundreds of applications and didn't hear back. I finished a long personal project, my friends didn't really care. I tried talking to some people, they didn't reply. Most friends I made recently weren't friends at all. A random woman shouted at me on the street for no reason. Now I might be crying myself to sleep. Idk. I thought I had this shit under control with the meds, but I guess not. Feels like I wasted years of my life and there's nothing I can do."
"The fact that I don't feel like doing anything is making me feel so guilty and sad. I'm bored but I don't want to do anything, just sleep, but if I sleep all day then I don't sleep at night. 

I know objectively what I should do to feel better but I just don't want to? Should I give in to this feeling or force myself to keep living life."
"I used to be very eloquent and a lot of my friends knew me as a person who'd often create interesting and funny metaphors in conversation. I've been severely depressed and unmedicated for it, since about the start of Covid. My main friend group fragmented a few months prior to that, so the pandemic felt doubly isolating for me.

Over the past 6 months or so I've started putting my life back together, and have managed to make a small handful of new and awesome friends. And a month ago I finally started Wellbutrin, which has taken my anxiety and depression from a 10 to a 5, and made life so much wholly more manageable.

In the course of things, though, I've noticed how severely my language skills have degraded. I'm both concerned and saddened by this. I feel I trip over my words and phrasing in conversation, or constantly struggle to recall words I'd previously use regularly. It's embarrassing, too, like I'm unable to express my thoughts cleanly or concisely.

Has anyone else encountered anything like this, and were you able to do anything to make progress in recovering? It's so incredibly frustrating, it's as if the knowledge and ability is almost there but I'm consistently unable to access it."
I just got out of the hospital 3 weeks ago (my 3rd time). I have been functional but craving smoking weed even though I have been sober almost 2 months now(hoping to improve my mental health). I have been feeling extremely depressed the past few days when normally functionally depressed and it makes me feel so bad for my partner because I was getting help 18 days and I feel almost the same as when I went just less suicidal. He is there for me and that takes a toll on him. I can see it. I have BPD and bipolar along with major depressive disorder and with a seasoning of PTSD and anxiety.  I get help I take my meds every dose every day. IM DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT! I‚Äôm still stuck in that trench just trying to climb out. I‚Äôm starting to feel like I can‚Äôt do it. I can‚Äôt keep just climbing a little way up and the dirt crumbling under me. I know it‚Äôs gonna pass. It‚Äôs always going to come back. It‚Äôs a cycle. I know it. I see it. I don‚Äôt think it gets better I think your brain just gets used to it. Either it gets better for you and you manage it better or you just get used to the constant pain and suffer with it instead of because of it. I feel like I‚Äôll be suffering knowing what it is and the symptoms of it I have and just accept this pain until I die one day or it kills me. I have always been a silent sufferer of my illness and should have gotten a lot more help a lot sooner. I feel like if I got the proper help sooner in life it would have been better off but now my brain has strict habits of misfiring and the chemistry of my brain is so set I am so fucked. I have the constant feeling of shame and guilt along with the constant voice in my head I‚Äôm not good enough and it‚Äôs going bananas with it right now. My go to way of describing my reality is that my brain has 40 monologues and 30 sometimes more sometimes less are trying to kill me. My brain is completely different to my heart and soul. I know I wanna get better. I have aspirations and hopes and dreams. Those are held in my heart but my brain just can‚Äôt process them into making them a reality. It fucking sucks. I don‚Äôt want to feel this way anymore but I know it will never truly go away. I‚Äôll just get used to it and suffer with it. And one day in my life I‚Äôll either die from it or learn to just live with the pain. But for my boyfriend and my small family I love sake I just learn the way I have to live with it.  Idk anyways here‚Äôs a pic of my cats.

Hear me out please. I love helping my friends when they need it most. I feel like I am a good support system for those around me. The problem is I don‚Äôt feel safe having them as a support system for me for my deepest and darkest feelings/thoughts.

I have so many people coming to me for help (which is sweet and a comforting thought) but I can‚Äôt get my own thoughts together when I‚Äôm helping several people out all at one time. I can‚Äôt handle myself and 5 others that consistently ask for help and need my attention. Am I selfish for wanting to stop? Should I stop? Should I just keep going and wait until it ends? Am I selfish for feeling this way?
" Hi!I need to open myself here, because I really don't know what to do!   


I am not getting any professional help until late December, because there are no free therapists near me! I've went to an emergency-counseling at a hospital some days ago, but all they did was give me adresses to psychatrists that are fully booked and have free places next year or late december!   


My backstory: I (m35) worked through a Mt Everest of shit to be where I am / was now / a few months ago. 

I've lost my parents due to sickness and suicide, my siblings got severe mental health problems and are living in a psych-ward. 

But despite of this, after years of therapy I've managed to get a nice home and a permanent-employement-contract at a nice workplace (well, it was nice the last years) 

My friends now are so occupied with their own problems, that I barely see them and I started to befriend my coworkers. 

But since a months I've been battling severe Burnout-syndrome and one of the worst depressions I had for at least 10 years!! 

I have medication that SHOULD help, but it doesn't. I had techniques to battle my depression (like meeting positive people, go out, have some kind of process to stop the negative thoughts), but due to an enourmous workload and some problems in my social-circle nothing worked. 

I've started to get panic-attacks, sudden uncontrollable 

 waves of sadness at work and all my energy and motivation went down the gutter. 

I feel lifeless and totally burned out! I could cry the whole day, but I can't. I can't concentrate anymore and I've lost all my humour and wit! 

I used to get my coworkers to laugh all the time, I used to get shit done at work, but since we started to be understaffed for many months now, all my Energy and motivation went away. 

A very good coworker and... maybe a Friend tried to hook me up with another co-worker and we met some time and it was very nice. 

But since my Depression has flared up again, she stopped replying to my texts and turned ice-cold when I meet her at work. 

Made my depression even worse. I feel alone and ... lifeless and like I can't do anything to stop all my achievements to slip away. It's absolutely horrible! My boss was very understanding (for now), but I know that my pay will be reduced because my sick-days! 

I feel like a Zombie and I am totally terrified how I relapsed so fast and made my achievements mean nothing! 

I don't know what to do and how I can even survive until my appointments! To make things even worse, we had so many people on sick-leave recently, that we few remaining had to work even more. I am now on sick-leave too, but I can't relax! 

I can't stop my mind thinking about my coworkers and the Date that ghosted me. I feel like such a failure again! 

I feel like I'm missing the human warmth around me and see only hate everywhere. I even tried hooking up, just to cuddle (!!), but Tinder &amp; Co just made me even more depressive. 

I felt used and robbed. Like a loser who was swindled into paying for a ""dating-app""!   


I don't know what to do. I feel lost! "
"I'm on meds. And it definitely made me feel better and have enough motivation to clean out my depression room. I've been doing it a few days but I'm just tired and wanna give up. I was really sore the previous day. There's still soreness now but it's better but I don't feel like continuing at all. I wanna take a break from cleaning and decluttering but feel like that is a bad idea and counter productive to what I'm trying to achieve (a clean room). 

Yeah I know this post is kinda dumb. But what would you do?"
"

I don't think I have an eating disorder so I hope this okay here but I've been a new issue pop due to depression. 

Tbh I've always grown up with junk food due to bad parenting.

Thanks to covid and food delivery well the problem kinda just got worse. Sure I was able to stop it sometimes.

....but since ive struggled to eat anything I've been relying on junk food.

Again it dosent help I don't know how to cook for myself I'm also intellectual impairment and have an irrational fear of the oven. 

But I've been actively skipping meals more then I normally do.

The only other person I know that has it is my sister and my family had a history of both abuse, neglect and so forth.

I just food shouldn't be this hard to handle so I don't know what's going on...I know my dad has told me I need to loose weight before that gets out of control.

I just idk"
"I'm so tired of life. My friends don't really talk to me anymore, I can't talk to anyone, I'm just made fun of for being suicidal. I didn't ask to be alive or to be like this, I'm just sick of humanity, Im not supported, even on some of these subreddits similar to these, I'm just ignored. I'm tired of fighting, at this point it's so much easier to just be gone. I'm to stupid to actually have a future, I know that I'm 14 and that I have time, but I just don't have the energy or motivation to keep up with everything. I'm not loved and I won't ever find anyone that loves me. This is just a vent post, I don't expect any responses at this point."
"Hi, I (23f) was diagnosed with a rare condition a couple months back. The entire situation has been incredibly challenging to deal with. From the doctors admitting their lack of experience with the condition to the painful side effects I‚Äôm dealing with every day, I just feel so lost and sad from everything. 

I was completely healthy one day and all of a sudden I‚Äôm sick and now my everyday decisions are based on how my body feels. I hate feeling like I had to pause my entire life. I can‚Äôt do anything by myself anymore and the lack of independence is making me feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. When I look in the mirror, I feel like I don‚Äôt even recognize myself, I feel like my reflection is someone else entirely. I‚Äôm trying so hard to stay positive and take it day by day but it‚Äôs been so hard. On top of the pain, my medication has been causing auditory hallucinations, and they‚Äôre disturbing at times. When I‚Äôm alone, I start uncontrollably crying. I try to distract myself when I‚Äôm alone but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the right thing to do anymore. 

I miss being healthy. I miss my life before I got sick. I have no idea how to cope with this anymore. I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist and taking medication but I just feel so powerless throughout all of this. If anyone has been through something similar, or knows someone who has, I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice on what helped them."
I've been so suicidally depressed recently and don't have anyone to help me. I just want to know what the process of calling it is like. Will they send police to my house?
"Ill start by saying sorry if this isn't the right place. I tried r/relationshipadvice but the bot said it looked like I was asking for who's right who's wrong, which I'm not. So I don't know where else to turn. I don't know where to go from here. I'm backed into a corner. I'm currently living with my ex. We just completely ended things 3 days ago and we were together for nearly 3 years. It's been some of the worst years of my life. She is one of the angriest unapologetic least understanding people I've ever met. I'll admit I've stepped over the line throughout the course of the relationship. But after dealing with this everyday Im bound to snap at some point. Never put hands on her, never cheated. Just snapping by yelling and saying things I shouldn't have out of anger. But, ive never been as angry as she is. It's 24/7. She openly admitted through text today of her being the angry one and me being the calm one. I've tried being there for her in so many ways, but she always tells me she's not taking advice from me. She constantly interrupts everything I say and doesn't even try to understand my side when I'm actively acknowledging and validating how she feels. When I try to see eye to eye and come at the problems with a level head I'm only met with being degraded and being told the reason she's angry and being a complete jerk is justified for reason x,y,z. She does these things and the next day will make me food and buy me snacks, but will never apologize. Then it happens again, and it's been this cycle. The entire relationship the main focus has been me doing something she doesn't like or not doing something she wants me to do. So for 3 years most of my thoughts have been consumed by ""am I doing this right"" ""should I be doing that"" ""what could I be doing better"". Any time I try to bring up something she's doing that's bothering me or something like her leaving clothes on the floor in the bathroom after a shower, that's when the fights happen. The problem is I can't just up and leave, we split the rent and I go to college 5 minutes away. I'd have to go back to my mom's and that's far(I only have an ebike) to still be able to go to school. My mom and stepdad are also alcoholics and my mom only talks to me when she's drunk. She eventually turns it into a debate of some sort and when I have a different opinion she starts degrading me and invalidating my point of view. My dad is addicted to pills and pretty much just hates me. So I have nowhere to go. Since me and my ex broke up I don't get a text from a single person. My parents have never called me to see how I'm doing or ask to see me. I don't have a single friend to talk to. It's killing me. I haven't been sleeping. My heart rate stays around 95-100 when it's normally 72 BPM. My blood pressure is always elevated and I'm 24. It really feels like I'm just waiting to die. This is not the life I want. I'm stuck and can't really do anything to change it soon enough. There's so much more but I don't want to continue to burden anyone who may read this. I'm alone. I'm stuck. I'm hurt. I'm scared. Not a soul wants me in their life. Now, I don't want to be in mine."
Legit question - I have been depressed for about 3 months. I feel like I just cannot think ever since becoming depressed. Like I can't do my job. I'm not motivated. And don't even think properly like I used to. How did these factors change for you?
You ever just know someone's talking to you cause they wanna fuck but like you just don't care because you are so deprived from affection that any attention is good attention to you even though it's inherently bad?
"For my birthday, I went to a local Korean spa.

I spent about four hours in a variety of saunas and hot or warm baths to help me relax.

For about two weeks after, my dysthymia was... gone. It is no cure, but it gave me some relief.

My experience is just another anecdote, not data, but there seems to be some help from heat therapy: 'https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/heat-therapy-sauna-better-outcomes-treating-depression-cold-exposure

"Have you ever met people who actually feel happy? For my depressive brain it sounds like some kind of prank when a person says ""Yes, I live a perfect life. I love my life, my job and the people around me."" For me, being happy with life = impossible, it's like saying ""sugar is actually black"". I just don't understand how you can seriously be happy with this life, this world, etc."

"Hi everyone. For years I (F32) have had no energy as a general rule. I could sleep for most of the day and now lack any sort of motivation to do basic tasks. 
Any advice on how to get to a point of not being sleepy or to feel energetic would be appreciated!

"Just what the title says.

I'm in college for Digital Gaming/Interactive Media, I make games, make 3D models, code, it's cool, buy not passionate about it, **I love my personal work that I made from the skills I have learned, but my assignments/projects, I can not to do them, it's like my body is physically repulsed from doing it...**

**-**

I'm not sure if this helps but I've seen some people add this- I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety when I was 13, and I'm on the spectrum, just got diagnosed recently, just turned 20. 

\-

But it feels so good when I complete one piece of work, but I hate getting started and my brain is like- not letting me? I don't know how to explain, I really want to get caught up, but with a job and attending classes, I don't have time outside besides for sleep.

**I guess I make time for sleep, how do I make time outside of my already busy schedule for my projects that literally take hours to complete.**

Do I just wake up at the ass crack of dawn?  
Do I pull all nighters for a few nights and get ""locked in"" as some people say-

I just need help, how do I keep track of my progress even though I'm behind, I want to feel accomplished but know I won't because I'm already behind.

I appreciate your time, thank you."
"I've been in a state of... Something, lately. I get really irritated by every little tiny thing. I have a breakdown when my dog pooped a balloon the other day. My stomach is never full, spent 150 on door dash in October. Haven't gotten exercise since early April... I just need to know, is this depression? It doesn't help that my dad blames me for everything that goes wrong. Why even bother at this point? I just... Need SOMETHING, anything to make me feel better... "
"Not quite sure how to explain this feeling I‚Äôve always had, but I‚Äôll try.
Whenever I get mental health help, I obviously want to get better, but I‚Äôm also sort of afraid to?

Again, it‚Äôs really hard to put into words. But I sort of feel guilty. And like if I get better, I was actually faking it all along. Which I know is irrational but idk why I feel that way.
I also get scared as I improve people will assume I‚Äôm normal again and no longer be there to support me.

Not long ago, my therapist said I seemed to doing a lot better on my new meds, and that I may not have to see him anymore soon. That really scared me, because I was NOT okay yet. I did explain this to him and I‚Äôm still seeing him. I only get one appointment a month, though üá∫üá∏ü¶Ö

"don‚Äôt feel like you need to read this post. i just need a rant and a cry and hopefully posting something will help.

i have genuinely reached rock bottom. for the last 10 years of my life i‚Äôve experienced several situations which caused trauma and negative experiences that have genuinely altered my mental state.

i was assaulted numerous times as a teenager by the same customer from the pub i worked at. i still to this day have to live in my parents home which overlooks his. specifically the room where it happened. 
this threw me off education and i locked myself in the house for a year unable to face the idea of coming into contact with him. looking out my living room and seeing his house makes me feel sick to the deepest part of my stomach. but my only way out of this house is when my boyfriend finds one to buy. but i don‚Äôt want to feel like a burden to live with. 

this year i‚Äôve been sacked twice in the space of 8 months. i genuinely loved both jobs and gave them my all. however i mentally couldn‚Äôt cope. i‚Äôm now stuck in a position where i have got no money, can‚Äôt find another job that i would mentally be able to cope with and no idea what to do next. 

at the time of posting i have got exactly ¬£1.53 in my purse. no way of making money and no idea where i‚Äôm meant to go from here.

i‚Äôve spent nearly my whole life trying to recover from childhood trauma, my SA etc. and it has honest to god gotten to the point where i genuinely don‚Äôt think i can keep doing this. i know people say it‚Äôs selfish, but i truly thing im depriving myself from finally being free from this shit show of a life that i‚Äôve been thrown into. i couldn‚Äôt care less how my family would feel. i only worry for my boyfriend. i truly love him and pray to any god who will listen that he understands why i‚Äôve done what i plan to do. he‚Äôs the only person i want to forgive me. 

i hope my sisters can learn from my mistakes in life. i wouldn‚Äôt wish this pain i feel on my worst enemy. 

im sorry if you have ever felt the pain that i feel now. and im sorry for wasting your time if you read all this."
"I think where I live has a lot to blame for my circumstances, people say I‚Äôm a really beautiful woman, but yet, I really struggle to get a boyfriend, there‚Äôs literally no young men where I live as I live in a holiday town where everyone comes and goes and there‚Äôs loads of old people here. 

People say oh I‚Äôve got it so good living where the sunshine is but yet, it‚Äôs okay to have no opportunities.. nobody actually finds love here, but the people that are with someone here moved from somewhere else to be here together.

I‚Äôm 29 and I know you‚Äôre gonna say that I‚Äôm young and I have time, but it‚Äôs not about that. It‚Äôs about how I feel. I just want to be loved but unfortunately I am so picky because people always say I can do better about every guy I went out with. 

It‚Äôs as if people make me feel like I‚Äôm too good for everyone that I feel like there‚Äôs no one out there for me or at least in the country and town that I live in. 

It hurts to realise that the love of my life is positively back in my home country but my family insisted that we live abroad so I am purposely away from any chances of meeting anyone back because there‚Äôs nobody in this country for me and I‚Äôm limited to the young people that live here even if we are not compatible.

Even so, i‚Äôm coming to the point that I don‚Äôt even now how to meet men anymore but I don‚Äôt know how to make it work either because I‚Äôve been forced to be single my whole life that I don‚Äôt know how relationships work, every time I meet any men, they are temporary and they don‚Äôt stay, whether it‚Äôs because of the country and where I live or it‚Äôs really me that‚Äôs the problem or I am just and truly in the wrong place for love right for me. 

I‚Äôve come to the point that I have no more time of my life to waste around waiting for something that probably won‚Äôt even happen even tho Im making an effort to put myself out there, but it seems that I am destine to be forever single and never settle down and not have kids as love isn‚Äôt in my cards.
It is that I realise I just have to get on with life and then eventually I will come to a point where I don‚Äôt want to live anymore from loneliness.

It seems that you can only get love if you are not bothered about it when people say it comes when we don‚Äôt expect it, but it doesn‚Äôt help how I feel and it doesn‚Äôt work for me like that. Every guy I met unexpectedly, I turned them away because I didn‚Äôt want anyone at the time. But yet now I want someone nothing happens. It seems you have to not want someone to have someone. I don‚Äôt get it."
"I'm 40 years old, single and living with parents. I messed up my life for 15 years (20-35) due to a gambling problem. This destroyed my confidence, self esteem, and finances. I have also developed an anxiety condition. I can't seem to find myself again and feel like I need a partner to help me rediscover how to be happy again. Finding a partner in my current situation seems impossible due to my circumstances. What woman would be interested in a 40 year old who lives with parents, is anxious and has no confidences or self esteem? I feel so sad and lonely. I don't know how to get out of this rut. Everyone at work has dismissed me as some kind of hopeless loser and won't even attempt to talk to me. I feel so depressed. I have found myself becoming desperate and having obsessive thoughts about a colleague even though we're not suited. It's simply because I feel so lonely and sad with no one to talk to. I can't get her out of my head and it doesn't even make sense because like I said, we're not suited. She sees me as a loser like everyone else does anyway! Apart from my parents everyone has given up on me and I've lost all my friends. I'm sitting here crying and feeling desperate! And I'm not a bloke who cries so I must be depressed!"
"Hey everyone,

my girlfriend has recently come clean about having a depressive phase or possible depression, including thoughts of self harm. She has cut herself a few times already, and although I know that I cannot solve it for her, I want to do as much as I can without pushing her or being an ass.

We have been in a long distance relationship for 2 years now, and plan to move together next year. She has already started therapy.

I know there aren't any universal actions a partner can take in this case. It really depends on the situation and the person, but I wanted to know if someone has some tips or ideas for me on how I could help her best or what to avoid. Maybe someone experienced can share some knowledge on how to handle this.

I have asked her what I can do already, but she says she doesn't know. As I understand it, she is confused herself and struggles even to help herself. But since I don't want to do nothing at all, I thought maybe I could do some little things that take weight off of her.

What things should I avoid doing, that maybe seem too pushing or overwhelming, and what are some common things I can do?"

I can‚Äôt pay off my debt if I don‚Äôt have work, I can‚Äôt afford to socialize if I don‚Äôt have money from a job.  

I just want to give up today .  I‚Äôm tired of how people treat me.  I hate living in a country where I can‚Äôt understand people from jack fucking squat.  I just want to go home for Christmas and die in peace"
I got severely bullied from 8 to 18 years old to the point of multiple suicide attempts when I was younger. This past led to me having rather poor mental health and constantly falling in and out of deppressions till arouns 25 years old for 2 years I didn't fall back. I'm 28 now I fell back hard and I'm scared I will break. I feel like I can't continue living for others.
"I have no one in my life I can talk to about my feelings or anything else really personal. I am living abroad and want someone to talk to me actually i have so many people to talk but i feel they just hear it nd reply whatever comes in mind without understanding situation.

Last Friday he said he was feeling absolutely shit and his work/life situation is beyond fucked. I immediately replied with ‚ÄòWhat do you mean?‚Äô but there was no response so I called him last Saturday (I‚Äôm well aware some people don‚Äôt want to talk on the phone when they are depressed, but I had to try), but as I‚Äôd expected he didn‚Äôt answer.

"Day after day. I wake up early, go to the gym, go to school, go to work, do chores, study, eat. This year I changed my life around to this schedule, compared to previous years where I was a bum and almost kicked out of uni. Yet I am still depressed. I try day after day just to live, hoping that today I will finally win, but it seems that I just keep losing.

Today l asked my only dorm friend and crush for some flash cards, she responded hours later with a call that I missed. I called back 10 minutes later and she told me she had them, but I should come later as she is about to go to the gym. I told her I was downstairs and just needed to take the elevator upstairs and then hung up. Me and this guy take the elevator up at the same time and we both walk to her door. I knock and she answers with a smile, then lowers it when she noticed it was me. She says hi and I say hi, the other guy walks beside me and goes inside and closes the door behind him. I didn't even get the fucking flash cards. Why the fuck is it always me... why can the universe or god or whatever not give me one singular win. I swear to god my life fucking hurts 24/7 it's not even worth living.
Like my soul feels like it is getting crushed constantly, I don't even know what tf to do anymore with my life. It's either I don't try and just live, not being clean, eating junk, wasting time not going class or study, and I am depressed. Or I try my hardest to go to the gym, eat health, get good grades, and still I am depressed. Sometimes I don't grades, and still I am depressed. Sometimes I don't even feel down anymore, I just laugh at how ironic my fucking life is.

"Apologies for using a meme word, but I mean it.

I have depression and anxiety. I have also been deeply entrenched in election news for the past couple months. When I get anxious, I try to do research to alleviate that anxiety, but the current political/media landscape is built so much on gaining clicks that everything has been ramped up to apocalyptic hyperbole and it's impossible to get a measured answer.

I'm trying to remain optimistic that Harris will win despite the polls (presidential polls have been wrong debatable all the way back to 2012), but I still want a pragmatic answer of what to expect in the event of a worst case scenario.

I don't believe that Trump will become an autocrat (as much as he wants to be); I find it highly unlikely that an incompetent, lazy man pushing 80 could undo nearly 250 years of democracy in 4 years. But I am worried about the sliding scale, and things he could realistically achieve in the short term. I want to have faith in state-level governments (especially with more and more republicans turning on him), the judicial branch, and organizations such as ACLU.

I live in Tennessee (not by choice) and just up and moving to a blue state is not feasible with my current financial situation. Most of my family are republicans, I don't discuss this with them. Nearly all of my friends are somewhere on the LGBT spectrum (I suspect I might be too) and spread out across the country, and I don't want to see them get hurt by people who don't give a shit about them.

The election is *always* in the back of my mind. I can lose hours of the day just doomscrolling in an attempt to find something concrete and reassuring. I've lost pleasure in hobbies. Lately, it's been difficult to find any joy or enthusiasm for anything when it feels like there's a 50/50 chance the world could end in two weeks (I know that's not literally what will happen, but it sure feels like it). I have medication, but I don't have a therapist, and it's not like I can get one soon anyway. I have no idea what to do.

Thank you."
"Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling really heavy and waking up much later because of lack of desire to actually get out the bed and do stuff. I‚Äôve been noticing this pattern increase over the past two years, especially on rainier/overcast days like today (I live in Washington) and am wondering if it‚Äôs possibly seasonal depression. 

I hoping to get some insight on what others may feel or how their seasonal affective depression affects them. Does it feel like your body is heavy all day and it‚Äôs really hard to just do anything (especially mentally)?

Thank you for any advice or examples you can offer üíõ"

"The title. I spiralled really bad. It's been a week and I barely interact with my family. I have been sleeping all day. I wake up in the evening, sometimes at night. Yesterday or today I took a really long shower at 4 am after 4 or 5 days, I don't remember. The plan was to nap for a bit and hit the gym. It's 5pm now. I didn't follow through with the plan. I am also searching for a good job. I am supposed to but the last application was a week ago. I also volunteer for mediation activities and it's seems I have too much on my plate with them. I haven't gotten back to them since 3 days. I don't feel like. I don't even feel like meditating. I know I should but I can't. I don't know what's the step 1 out of all this. I need a job, my savings are drying. And I can't seem to get out of my existential crisis. What am I still doing here, broke and educated, without creating any good. What's my use then. 

I am writing here to be directed to the next steps. Thank you, I hope you can make sense of what I wrote.

"So I'm 16 and earlier this year l I had two back to back suicide attempts - basically I attempted, went to E.D then the next night ended up back again. I wasn't even close to dying, I got stitches the second time but that was it but now I'm left with huge keloid scars. My mum wants me to hide them, every time I wear a t-shirt out she tells me to cover up and is always staring at them, my sister makes fun of them and I'm just so insecure about them. I might get a tattoo when I'm 18 or some sort of cover up because it's such an inconvenience to wear long sleeves all the time, like, it's summer and I'm hot.

"Hello I'm 29 year old trans woman, I'm diagnosed with depression, cptsd, and adhd. I've been without medication, hormones or therapy for over a year now (insurance problem) however my depressed tendencies are getting really out of hand. 

My usual tendencies are taking non-negative words or actions in negative ways, catastrophizing (like having large negative reactions to basic communication about issues), mental and emotional self harm (dragging myself down, repeating phrases/events I KNOW make me hurt, or accepting bad things because I think I deserve it), projecting my abusers (when things turn negative I sometimes get verbally hurtful, or manipulative, or victimize myself), and self sabotaging (if I'm ambiently upset/depressed but not like ""at myself"" I will then act out or do something wrong and then all that negativity can be redirected inward and turned into more self hatred).

As you can imagine this makes talking with me sometimes a little nerve wracking as even necessary communication about how my actions have made my wife feel can cause me to go into a full blown spiral which can make her feel like she's just trying to interact with her wife and can't without hurting her. Also because I react to things she's doing with these depressed negative assumptions about her feelings or actions I paint this evil bitchy perception of her when that's now how she thinks or acts (this is partially abuser projection; I begin to act like I'm arguing with my mother). I feel like part of the problem is impulse control, the thoughts appear and race through my mind before I can stop them... I can't think of a way to stop these things but I don't want to keep hurting my wife"

"Will try to keep it brief;

Am 32M, UK. I've got a decent job (near ¬£30k), I rent, I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and have a decent diet, as well as participating in other hobbies. I've joined ""Meet-Up"" groups and suchlike.

Despite being outgoing in nature, I've never had a girlfriend, the chief reason given to me is ""ugly"". That's not my personal opinion, that's just what's given to me. It is not a lack of confidence or opportunity to meet people. I had a few of one-night stands in my early to mid 20s, but that seems like a lifetime ago now.

I'm at a point where all of my friends are partnered up, married and mostly having children. Whereas 10 years ago I'd be invited out to something most weekends, that's all gone away now. My friends are all lovely people and I do believe they enjoy my company, but now if I don't chase them to organise something, they will not come to me to sort out a meet-up or suchlike. Individually they would all say they're just busy and got a lot of things on, and that's true, but collectively it creates a world where it feels like I have to keep chasing people otherwise I'll spend most of my time alone. It would feel nice for someone to come to me for once.

What this has led to, combined with being unwanted by women, is a feeling that I really don't have a place in this world. I go to work, I go to the gym, maybe see a few friends, but that's it. Whereas they all go home to their partners and families, I wake up and go to bed in a world where I have no-one. I didn't feel like this at 20, or 25, but the older I'm getting the feeling is now setting in and it's not going away. It seems foolish just to keep on living in order to go to work, and on the off-chance that a friend might occasionally want something."
I hate myself so much because of how weak I am and how I make such bad decisions and mistakes. I am trying very hard to hold on because it is making me extremely depressed and hard to hold on.

I just feel sick and awful and wonder what to do with myself I am trying my best to calm down I just needed to talk about it

I have never seen this man before in my life and am seeking help. I tried contacting law enforcement who didnt even see the videos i had but because im frantic in my explanation he asked if i was using drugs again and said youre not being watched or followed youll be fine again not even looking at the videos. Im not crazy im not imagining this shit i have videos of them and their license plate however its a little blurry. Not sure how much help I can get but PSA I am not wanting to harm myself nor do I want to kill myself I have no intention of running away.

"Husband (38) is severely depressed and has expressed that he's losing hope that things will turn around. He's been diagnosed, as of September, with Bipolar II and has PTSD. We are also expecting our first child in January 2025.

It's hard to know where to start to explain this journey, but will do a bulleted list to try to be concise( if possible)

* Had worked at a ""dream job"" for 2 years but his contract ended Sept '23 (not due to performance, but because they only budgeted for a 2 year contract -- which he knew when taking the job) which was the first blow to his happiness. 
* His best friend passed away from cancer and he no longer has a best friend that is ""his mirror"". 
* Got Lasik eye surgery in January 2024 and has major complications since (pain, poor/unstable vision, major halos/double vision, poor night vision). No glasses or contacts will solve these issues. He had really bad vision before (-9.5) and thought this would take something off his plate, make his life easier and allow him to get up at night and care for a kid.
   * This has caused him to blame himself for not seeing red flags, for doing something ""risky"", and feels like he's sabotaging himself. 
   * **This is a big root of his current depression, anxiety and the PTSD. The deep regret that this has cause has really dug such a deep hole.**
   * **A big problem is he draws a direct line between happiness and his vision, and his vision will never go back to how it was so he has determined there's no reason to try/live.**
* He's currently seeing a psychiatrist and is on a ""cocktail"" of medications that were doing pretty well to stabilize his mood enough to not have extreme breakdowns but still will have crying spells or unable to get out of bed. *However, this week he's been having a spell multiple times a day, every day.*
* Tried a PHP program but found it to be too basic and not focused enough on how to help him specifically. 
* Has a talk therapist, and is trying a new PTSD focused person. And is also interested in trying EMDR or ART therapy. 
* Has admitted that he doesnt know how to help himself and not sure if he wants to help himself.
* Will sit and cry on the couch or in bed for hours unable to control his mood, *severe melancholy.* 

  
I have some feelings of my own about everything -- i think he is waiting for a cure all, magic something that will take away all of the pain or bring back his vision. He gets caught up trying to ""prove"" to people that he's so sad, or so unable to get better and often saying ""no one understands"" like he's waiting for their approval to give up. 

  
I guess, all of this is to ask for **help from a concerned and sad spouse.** It's getting increasingly hard for me to know what to do for him, or how to help him. I'm finding myself to be sad and having depressing moments more often, but *i will make it clear that i'm not going to leave him*. I am willing to try any and everything to keep him on this earth and to find him relief. I'm also starting to lose hope, which i think is the scariest part for me.

**If anyone has suggestions, things that have worked for them or a loved one, if there's positive stories of people who have come out of an almost 1-year rut of depression.** "

"I'm 30, I still don't have a job, not even a low category job like McDonnald's althought I've tried and apply everywhere, corrected my CV applying the key words of each offer, created different motivation letters, good language and all the points to pass the filter. I've finished my studies years ago but they were all for nothing, there's no work in that so I keep searching in other things, even the smallest just to have an income but it isn't working. I'm tired. I feel frustrated and I don't have anyone to blame than myself. I could say the economy in my country is going worse and everything is shit but everyone I know has been working since their 20s, I don't know if it's luck, knowing the right people from inside or if I'm just good for nothing. I constantly feel like the third option is the real one. Maybe I've taken the wrong path or bad decisions that put me in this situation, I don't know what to think, why I'm just getting rejected everywhere.

To sum up, I don't want to keep living anymore and keep feeling like a parasyte living at the expense of others, I hate it. I'm a failure to my family and I've perceived it in their looks, they are clearly dissappointed about my situation but I understand them, I also feel the same. I'm tired of being depressed, tired of trying to get my life together, tired of being a burden to the few people I love. 

I just want to end it peacefully. But I'm no longer a teen and recently I become afraid to really die, like, for real, death is the end. I have no energy left to keep living neither to kill myself, so I'm just in a limbo of emptiness."
"It's.... bad.

I'm in a hording situation due to my over a years hard depression. Honestly thinking about it, I've always lived the way I do. Trash and laundry on the floor with a rather distinctive odor in the air. But it's not been this bad. 

My partner deals with chronic pain that prevents them from bending or lifting much at all. So I'm the one who needs to figure this out. There's trash from the floor to the ceiling and every room of the house needs work. 

To top it all off it's time sensitive too. 

I don't have insurance or an active ID (been about 10 years since I could bring myself to make an apointment to renew it.)

I'm in deep and could use anything to get me through. I do want to change and I hate living like this. If I could wayve a wand or pay someone to take care of this problem properly, I would. 


So any advice for sitting at the bottom of the well?"
"Was I sexually assaulted 

Hi I‚Äôm 14 F, so I know I‚Äôm a little young to me on here but I can‚Äôt sleep because this is really bothering me I really need help. So this happened a few years ago i was 5 or 6 and in pre-school. So what happened is we where watching ‚Äúbrave‚Äù in class then the teacher started pulling kids into the hallway where there was no one and they all came out looking weird, so then it was my turn the teacher took me into the hallway and pulled down my pants and started touching my butt at one point I remember she had spread open my cheeks ( I‚Äôm not to sure it was a few years ago) and then she walked me back outside to the other kids and I just remember crying. Then my mom picked me up and took me home and I remember crying to her saying I didn‚Äôt want to go back to school, she asked me why and I told her but I don‚Äôt the she believed me. But anyways I don‚Äôt think I went to school for two days because I was so scared. Then eventually my mom said I had to go back and that she talked to the teacher and she said she was going to say sorry but she never did. Ever since then I had forgotten about it was recently I‚Äôve been getting flashbacks and I get really uncomfortable and feel like I have to cover my butt with something. So I really don‚Äôt know if what happened was sexual assault or just a normal thing teachers do so please help me and tell me if it is SA."

"I‚Äôm 33 F single mom of two boys. I have them 100%. I‚Äôm currently going through the worst emotional/mental/financial state I‚Äôve ever been in. I‚Äôm at a loss of how to feel better. Financially I‚Äôve struggled for over 2 years since a long relationship ended. I‚Äôd kept the house since my ex‚Äôs name wasn‚Äôt on it. I‚Äôd had a room mate at first, but now I‚Äôm on my own. I‚Äôve been just keeping my nose above water with debt. But mentally and emotional I was really ok. 6 months ago, met a guy and even though we never took steps to bring family in to it, I really fell hard for him. I wasn‚Äôt aware of how emotionally invested I was until we had one issue and he refused to work together to fix it. Instead we‚Äôve since agreed to step it back to physical only until we figure out if we want to reconcile. At first I was for it. But that was two weeks ago, he has cancelled any plans we‚Äôve had. Last minute. I was holding out hope thinking a short time of distance would help. But he only shows desire when he wants to and that‚Äôs very limited. So emotionally, I‚Äôm devastated. I want him to work on this with me. But I also am painfully aware of how he is making me feel disposable right now. I feel stupid because he is all I can think about. Like cannot do anything to keep me busy enough that he isn‚Äôt the main thought. I hate this. On top of the financial situation, I just feel like I‚Äôm failing. Idk how. But I need help. I need connection. "
I thought I had a support system for when I feel like this but I went to my closest friends house and he was kind enough to try to distract me for a bit but I needed his help to actually make a reasonable decision or at least talk it out and he wasn‚Äôt helpful at all. I remembered that he actually hates when people cry in front of him and I was being more of a burden than I‚Äôm worth at this point so I left. Called my best friend multiple times but she‚Äôs asleep and won‚Äôt pick up. I just want to end it all and I just want to have someone who can help me make a pro-con list and talk out the actual consequences. Clearly I‚Äôm at a point where I just need something to tip the scales and not having anyone to talk to is not helping. Currently sitting in a gas station parking lot wondering what I could use to kill myself efficiently.

I just can't deal with this anymore, I feel like shit and just can't deal with it. I have considered suicide."

"I started meds for my depression 3 years ago when my depression got so bad that I was spending entire days in bed.

Over the months I tried minor changes to my meds depending on my needs at the time. And now I'm in the worst slump since I first started them.

I wouldn't describe myself as 'depressed' , more 'bored'. I feel so bored but have no energy to do anything about it because I know the boredom won't go away because I know no happy chemicals will be released if I do the thing.

I've tried many things to stop myself from getting bored: work, exercise, cooking, writing, gardening, video games, hanging out with people, volunteering, upskilling.

I still do those things, just in smaller amounts than I used to. I've also stopped mostly going to events and places by myself. However, 'hanging out with people' is one that I've severely reduced. This is because I realised that no matter how much I force myself into hangouts and social spaces, I never actually make real friends. So I just stopped doing it, it's not worth my energy. In addition, it's also caused my social skills to rot as now I can't make friends even if I wanted to because I never know what to say. Which could be because again, my life is boring.

So why don't I just do more of the things I mentioned? As I already said, I just have no reason or energy to do them, because I don't feel much different when doing them. There's no real satisfaction in them.

And the worst is that I'm starting to blame myself for it. Where does the average person get motivation to do all the things they do? Do they feel satisfied and feel happy chemicals just for doing stuff  ?

I've pondered going to therapy. But my guess is that they'll recommend a philosophical/Gestalt kind of therapy that focuses on meditation and 'living in the moment', when I've tried that before and it failed, and because maybe what I really need is better meds."
"I think it‚Äôs time to go. I can‚Äôt be here anymore I am sick and tired of living in fear. 

Why do I have to be the one who stays up at night and wait for my father to come home drunk and cry to me. I am tired of having to anxiously wait for him to make sure HE gets home safe. Why am I that one taking care of HIM. When he is MY father and HE should be there for me. I‚Äôm tired of seeing him so sad and beat. I love my father so much. I want him to get better I want him to realize what he‚Äôs telling me when he‚Äôs drunk. Having to hear your father tell you that he wants to die breaks my heart and My sister whom I care for deeply is constantly in and out of the hospital she‚Äôs always trying to leave me. Now my brother took his life and I was never close with him but why, WHY is that the last resort. 

I physically feel my heart ripping it physically hurts. And I can‚Äôt understand why. 

Maybe it‚Äôs my turn too‚Ä¶"
"I‚Äôve been so lonely to the point that the people that are around me well the few of them that I meet I know they‚Äôre using me even when it comes to sexual encounters. There‚Äôs a few guys that I hook up with at the end of the day they are using me or I always get lied and I‚Äôm very aware of that but my confidence and loneliness is killing me, I have drifted away from my friends that I used to work with Then. I‚Äôm not working as much as I used I‚Äôm really tired of this loneliness all my life I always had my ups and downs more disappointment than achievements. I know that I am aware of my depression when I was in my teens and I succeeded to live myself that was the most closest that I‚Äôve ever done but now I feel like I‚Äôm coward because I don‚Äôt even find the strength of the courage to do so. People look at me or even on my social media and would think that I live beautiful life. That‚Äôs all I disguise myself as something that is not because being real is so hard my social media looks like I‚Äôm always involved in things, but at the end of the day, I am very secluded unless if I have to be an activist for social justice that‚Äôs for my action shines that my has never been the best. I‚Äôm 40 years old and I feel as though that I have not changed emotionally nothing I‚Äôm lonely and I‚Äôm tired of being lonely. I‚Äôm close with my family members and I guess that helped me but other than that I feel empty"
"I hurt my bestfriend. Multiple times. I had these like episodes where I would annoy him. It‚Äôs like a compolsive need to do it or something would go wrong. During these episodes I would say really bad shit to him or physically scratch him or dig my nails into him. Now he hates me although he‚Äôll deny it and I have no one anymore. I also would break his things. Just geanuinly be an ass. I still do the emotional stuff to him sometimes whenever he pisses me off. It feels like I can‚Äôt control it sometimes and I don‚Äôt know what to do. He‚Äôs also the only thing that keeps me happy, And he dosent hang out with me anymore. Then he‚Äôll randomly decide he‚Äôll like me and we will be chill for a bit until I either make him not like me or he decides he dosent wanna. 

What do I do man"
It all seems meaningless. I have the feeling this life is just a stream of disappointment and pain. I never really tried suicide but I have this feeling that just not being in existence would be much more pleasant. I just wanted to share because I don't really have anyonevI feel comfortable to tell this. I would love to hear some of your thoughts and experiences.
"I genuinely feel like life wasn't meant for me (24M)

I don't usually like venting on the internet but it would be nice to get some advice because the people around me don't really want to be honest with me.

Since quite a young age I have been depressed and socially anxious. It all really hit me the hardest in college because I am on the Autistic spectrum and came from a special needs school before going there.

It was a completely different world by comparison and I got a lot of unwanted attention, people tell me that you wouldn't know I'm autistic unless I tell them but I think that's just a lie people tell everyone like me.

I was for the most part an outcast and always alone and very anxious of my surroundings/ people around me. The worst people were girls that would randomly come up to me (different ones every time) and just give me a hard time for no apparent reason.

I can't meet up with people half the time because I just ruine everything, like for example my friend likes going out on the town to nightclubs. I went with him a few times but it's just too overwhelming for me and of course it's full of people who I have no business being around because I don't belong in social settings so I just cut it short and went home.

Relationships with women are simply out of the question aswell for me, I can't meet people out and about because like I said above I can't be social with people because it's just too scary for me and given my past experiences I am clearly just a joke to the opposite gender as a whole and dating apps have never worked for me so I will inevitably be alone once my parents are gone.

Pretty much I don't think that life has ever been for me and I don't see things getting any better but I'm too much of a pussy to end it so for about the next 50-60 years I have no choice but to simply be miserable day in day out.

If you read this far then I appreciate it! Any advice would be appreciated."
"I'm 27 years old, I'm morbidly obese, I have high functioning autism, Asperger's syndrome, ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Trying to force myself to do even the most mundane of things is a battle at every turn, like trying to bite off my own finger. Anytime I try to get even to the prospect of being employed again I get so unbelievably upset that it can even bring me to tears sometimes. And it's unbelievably hard for me to change any habits, or adopt new better ones. I am unbelievably lonely, my heart's been broken by somebody that I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with, and now just as I start healing when I try to get my toes back into it I end up not only becoming involved with somebody I've known for a while that loves me and I care deeply about but believe that there are too many differences for us to work, but, and almost Shakespearean twist of cruel fate, have found somebody that I've truly come to fall in love with but that does not love me back at least not in that way. My mother is fairly severely disabled and I still live with her. Trying to force myself to do anything as I said it's just unbelievably hard. I need help I need something, anything. I've talked to a doctor I'm trying to go see a new therapist I don't know how that's going to work I doubt that it's going to do anything for me to be honest. I don't even know if it's worth trying anymore. What the hell am I supposed to do? "
"For years, I've had really bad teeth. As a Child, my abusive father forbade me from brushing my teeth for years on end which made my teeth go worse over the years. As of recently, due to depression and just, generally feeling like not getting up, I've been neglecting brushing my teeth, resulting in a lot of pain and even a cracked tooth.

  
My problem now Is, that I know I need to go to a dentist and get my stuff fixed but, the thought of it alone just fills me with dread and I keep putting It off.

  
Is there any way that could help ease my anxieties with this?"
"It's not going to get better. I'm 40, I have health issues despite healthy living, I have a son who has no real family or friends, I have no family, my son's dad (ex husband) just moved in for financial and childcare reasons but he is a sedentary diabetic with zero ambition. He doesn't play with our son and usually just falls asleep. 

I have so much to do on a daily basis it's destroying me. I can't take care of myself and I'm struggling to take care of my son. 

Nothing is going to change. I have tried desperately. I have had positivity and taken my son on great adventures and given him experience and knowledge, but he still seems to just be irritated by life. I cook healthy meals and keep up the home but I also have cancer, vein disease and fibromyalgia. I give every last drop of myself every day and have lucid nightmares all night. 

I don't want to die, but there's no way out of this. It just keeps getting worse. I won't give up but I feel like I'm going to run myself into the ground until my son has no one. And I can't give to/teach him properly when I'm struggling this much.

I hate my life. I love living. I love my son and I love the potential we have but I just can't get there on my own. It's the worst feeling and it gets stronger every day. 

My parents passed away when he was born, so I've never had any advice or help.

I'm so tired."
"I hate my life, I‚Äôve never truly been happy and almost everyone always leaves. I‚Äôm a 35 year old female and my kids are preteen/teen. Dating for me has been pretty non existent, I‚Äôm not interested in the guys I can get, and the ones I am into, aren‚Äôt interested back. I have been feeling pretty hopeless my entire life, I have had a hard time making connections with people and keeping them. All of the people I‚Äôve been close with always leave. My best friend lives in another state and we rarely talk, she gave me up for her husband. It really hurts that people are just that willing to give me up and leave me. I have no relationship with either of my parents really, my mom stopped being a parent before I was a teen, and my dad stopped when I became an adult. The only person I see regularly is my grandma. I am in counseling and have been for years. My kids are all growing up &amp; will be moved out in just a few years, then I‚Äôll really be all alone. I don‚Äôt know what to do, or how to keep doing this. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts ever since I can remember. I don‚Äôt usually feel sorry for myself, sometimes this is just how life rolls, but I‚Äôm tired of it always rolling in one direction. I just wanna be done."

"Hi, I‚Äôm 24 (f) and need some advice atm. 

Recap of my last few months: went through a rough breakup, my grandmother passed away, I‚Äôve been to the ER twice, caught Covid AND strep, three of my best friends just moved away, and my mom just told me both of my childhood cats are dying from cancer. 

I‚Äôm honestly just looking for any life/health advice or tips or motivation to continue working. I‚Äôm so depressed and anxious I can barely function and I‚Äôm having trouble sleeping, and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to be fired because I‚Äôve been struggling to do basic work and I know people are frustrated with me. My therapist is also on vacation currently and I have ADHD and social anxiety. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

"I've been living in Manchester, England for the last two years and just came back to Pakistan. I hate it here. I hate everything here and have had hands down the worst days of my life in the past few days. I miss everything about England and want to go back. I want to ask my parents to let me live with my grandma in Manchester. If they say no I genuinely do not know what I'm going to do. Every time I think of how good my life was back in England I start crying because I just compare it to Pakistan. I really did try my best to look forward to coming back. I didn't know how sad it would make me until I came back. I didn't know it would have this much of an effect on me. I can't live the next two years of my life like this I can't. I went to my new school which I hate and just looking around I was thinking this can't be it this can't be my life now. For context I'm upper class. On paper literally every aspect of my life is better in Pakistan but I hate it. So much so I'm prepared to give up my gaming pc which is my pride and joy and not get a new phone if they just let me go back. I know I sound spoiled which I am but I really can't live in Pakistan I just can't do it. If they say no to letting me live with my grandma in Manchester my life is over I genuinely don't know what I'm going to do I'll actually go into depression which I had no idea was even possible I never could have imagined it would happen to me. If it wasn't against my religion I think I would end up killing myself. Anyway I just needed to vent any advice is appreciated."
"Like I don‚Äôt want to die or anything, just nothing excites me and I feel sad all the time. Like doing a fun event doesn‚Äôt bring me excitement. I am just always numb. I miss that childhood feeling of being excited for EVERYTHING! Sometimes i‚Äôll get a second of motivation or excitement towards something but it lasts for seconds. I need it to just last. Are there any drugs to help that? I just want a lust for life, and I wanna get excited when I do fun stuff. 

Thanks for listening.  "
"Everyday looks the same, I'm rotting into my bed with no strength to do anything. I used to run all the time everywhere i could, but now I can't even move. I've lost interest to what used to by my favorite things, there's nothing i want to do anymore. I'm so tired of feeling like a wreck, desperately looking for sympathy just to feel something. No one around notice how clearly I'm not doing okay, it hurts so much that no one cares.

I hate myself so much yet feel bad for the things that happened to that little girl I've once been. I'm barely 18 but don't feel like I'm gonna see my next birthday. I don't care about others anymore, how they'll react. I'm tired of putting on a show and feeling this fucking bad. 

After everything that I've been through it feels like I'm not allowed to become a decent person, so what's the point in going on anyway? There's nothing i could do to change anything in this world, so why am i even still here?"
"

About a month, my dad came into my room to tell me that bc he and my mom have bad credit, they were not approved for a ParentPlus loan to help me pay for college. He and my mom had been arguing about finances downstairs earlier that day (as they often do) but I didn‚Äôt know it had anything to do with me.

Right off the bat, he was very upset and began accusing me of never listening, saying I didn‚Äôt study hard enough for the SAT before I went to college and that‚Äôs why I only ended up with a 1300. 

I told him I did that I did actually try, and that I‚Äôve attempted to tell him that before. He then said that I was being too emotional and said something along the lines of ‚Äúwomen can‚Äôt argue without being emotional‚Äù. All I had done was slightly increase my volume. I told him, ‚ÄúHumans emote, dad‚Äù. I just wanted to say that it‚Äôs normal to show emotions when arguing.

From here, things escalated. He backhanded me across the face and when I fell down, he started punching me repeatedly. I held up my hands and legs to shield myself. When he couldn‚Äôt really punch me anymore, he kicked me in my left leg with his shoes on and at this point I was screaming. I turned and if I hadn‚Äôt put my hands across my back, he would have kicked me in my spine. This all lasted 30-40 secs and ended with him spitting in my face. I had a black eye for two weeks or so, a large bruise across my leg, and still have two bumps on my head.

Besides spanking as a child, and one other instance of pretty bad aggression when I was 13, he had never done anything like this before. 

After hitting/kicking me, he also said some things that really upset me like: my mental health struggles are a moral and spiritual failing, I just need to ‚Äúgo outside more often‚Äù and my depression will be solved, he‚Äôs given up on me and he wouldn‚Äôt have spent so much money on my college if he knew I‚Äôd never amount to anything (which especially hurt bc I have genuinely been trying and have worked hard to have a 4.0 up until this point.

I have struggled with depression and SI for a while but before this happened, I felt more motivated than ever to do whatever I could to finally feel happy. But for the past month or so I have been in a darker place than I ever have. I‚Äôve been dealing with increasingly worse thoughts.

I have forgiven my dad mostly because I know he is extremely stressed, hardworking, and highly strung. (He also wrote a letter apologizing for ‚Äúlosing his temper‚Äù) It‚Äôs just that he hasn‚Äôt made any effort to talk face-to-face and it still hurts.

Tomorrow is my first day of my fourth-year of school and I still feel really bad mentally. I don‚Äôt know if I am ready to go to class this week. I guess I am just venting/ looking for advice because I still don‚Äôt know how to feel"
"I really don't know what to do anymore. I always try my best to do things people tell you to do when you're depressed, but literally nothing really works for me. My meds don't work, playing videogames don't help, hanging out with family don't help, going outside doesn't help, getting help doesn't help, trying to be social doesn't help, trying to sleep doesn't help, trying to leave my bed doesn't help, doing literally anything doesn't help"
It's not that big of a problem but I've noticed I don't rely on anyone and always keep my blank face even if I try to it doesn't show too much unless I'm genuinely smiling. 
"Ive been depressed overall for years at this point. But my depression seems to come and go? It always has been. 

Like ill have it and ill be really depressed for months and then one day it will just be almost completely gone for a while, and then something bad happens (a fight with someone for example) and it will come back at full force for months yet again. It feels wrong, because when it just disappears i feel like there is something wrong with me and i dont know how to feel or what to do, especially when i tell my friends about it and then it just goes i feel like im lying.

Is this a certain type of depression or am i just weird?"

"I cant stand the summer because my depression and self hate just get worse and there's nothing to do.

I dont like to go out in public because I can't stand seeing people my age having fun with their friends and being happy. I can't stand social media either, seeing all my classmates and friends posting about their vacations and outings with their friends and family fills me with rage and I hate that I feel this way.

I also have a really bad inferiority complex that gets worse in public. Like I can't stand it when people are nice to me because I feel like they only do it because they pity me but when people aren't nice to me I get really upset and hate myself more. Seriously wtf is wrong with me? Does anyone else feel like this??"
"Hello, more than 6 months ago I was diagnosed with major depression.  I think all of us who are going through this are aware of how difficult and tiring this is. I feel like my life is being ruined and I don't find satisfaction in the things I do, they don't bring me happiness. I have been taking Anti Depressants all this time and attending therapy but I have not noticed a change. Tomorrow I have an appointment with my psychiatrist to see what changes we can make with the medication. I need advice, I have read a lot that there is no cure for this and you just learn how to deal with it, I am really scared and I find myself drained from crying so much. What activities have really helped you with this hell? Thank you and a big hug to all who are going through this!"
"I recently realised I have am an avoidant noticing a pattern of breaking up w my partners when I‚Äôm triggered but going back to them a few weeks later because I haven‚Äôt fallen out of love, I was just triggered and overwhelmed. But I realised how much damage that does to the other person, It made me go really harsh on myself, I couldn‚Äôt find any good sources on how to heal if someone is an avoidant, all the articles I read , termed me as a toxic red flag , but I don‚Äôt understand and know why I act the way I do . Can someone help me on how to heal if you‚Äôre an avoidant?"
"Yeah, pretty much the title. 

I noticed a couple weeks ago that I was more interested in doom scrolling than actually writing and that I was getting distracted pretty easily. I chalked it up to just being distracted for some reason.

Well, it was a portent of the fact my mental health was slow slipping. 

My motivation to write has also been not very high which should've been a barometer for how I feel, but no, I just thought my motivation was low. It's happened before. My motivation just isn't there for whatever reason, but I usually feel good by pressing on regardless.

And the fact that I've just been wanting to sleep more and more. 

A couple days ago, I just noticed my mental health was totally tanked and I was just...absolutely nothing. I was to the point that I just wanted to sleep and not wake up. I'm not to the point I want to just off myself. I call it ""existential exhaustion."" I'm to the point I just don't want to exist anymore. All I want to do is be curled up in my papasan and play cozy games. Currently playing Palia since I did my yearly Stardew binge a few months ago, so I'm kind burned out on it. 

The worst part for me is that *I want to write* but my motivation just *isn't there.* Writing is like pulling teeth which is terrible for me. Writing has been my purpose in life and my driving force since I was *nine years old*. It's been my main special interest for over 20 years. (I'm diagnosed Autistic, so yes, I am using the term appropriately.) I *want* to do it, but the *ability* to do it just isn't there. I'm doing it anyway even though my brain is just like ""ughhhhhhh I don't want to do this."" 

It's even worse because I currently have two sub-projects of a much larger project I want to get down. I want to do worldbuilding for two of the regions in the Pokemon Ranger spinoff game while finishing up what's left of my constructed language for ancient Oblivia. But I've put those on the backburner mainly because even just *normal writing* for two hours is really, *really* hard for me. Let alone spending nearly *four hours a day* on writing. "
"I think I've always been depressed, I don't ever remember being particularly happy as a young child. I always never felt like doing anything and was apathetic many of my days.

I always felt inferior and that never changed. I don't think I have many talents and I don't have the energy to try to get better at anything. 

I can't recall a single time in my life when I was just happy, where I felt truly motivated to do something. Any time I felt any motivation to learn something new it would be maybe a burst of energy for a day or two and very rarely maybe even a whole week.

Those bursts of energy are very far and few between though so I'd say 99% of my life that I can recall so far as just been me trying to get by.

I can't get therapy or medication so I just feel stuck since I have no one, no friends at all and my family doesn't care for me so I just really don't know what I should do.

I'm afraid nothings worth it, I don't feel like I can find anything I enjoy since I can't bring myself to try anything. And those moments where I possibly could enjoy something are short lived and I'll go right back to feeling the way I've always felt.

On top of that I'm 17, so I've been feeling this way since I was no older than 5 which just makes me feel hopeless since what real chance do I have to get better if I felt miserable in the most carefree times of my life."
"I‚Äôm 18m, autistic, and have suffered with bad mental health issues all my life. From anxiety, to depression, to panic disorder, ARFID. I didn‚Äôt have a good childhood and spent a lot of time alone and scared.

I didn‚Äôt continue after high school because that‚Äôs when panic disorder was at its worst, and I didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt have access to therapy. For the last 2 years I‚Äôve been stuck in the same cycle of feeling trapped at home, but having crippling fear and panic when I leave my house. I‚Äôve been unable to get a job or be in education.

Today, my closest friends got their exam results and they‚Äôre all going to Uni. I‚Äôm really happy and proud of them, but deep down I feel so awful.

I know I‚Äôm on my own path, and everyone has different challenges, but right now I feel like a failure, who‚Äôs losing his friends to uni, and missing out. I‚Äôm stuck in a miserable home, with no help, and every other night has been a phone call to a helpline.

I feel angry, I feel sad, I feel scared.

My sleep is awful, my eating‚Äôs awful, my life is awful. Every time I try and improve myself I get stuck in a depressive episode and cannot leave my bed.

I feel like a lazy slob, an embarrassment. All I want is to leave my awful home. University was my chance to, and I‚Äôm not going.

How can I possible not compare myself to my friends? People tell me not to, and that I should celebrate my own victories, but truthfully they are pathetic. How is brushing my teeth worth celebrating? How is doing anything but dying worth celebrating?

I don‚Äôt know what I want. I feel like a want to cry but I can‚Äôt get the tears to flow. I‚Äôm on my third type of antidepressants and feeling nothing.

"I've lived with varying levels of depression for as long as I can remember. It's been difficult to manage for the last seven years for me and has gotten more difficult every year with no respite. I've lost the best relationship I'd ever cultivated, and just about all my friends and family. Despite some positive changes recently in our political future, I am convinced humanity will consume itself in greed and selfish novelty, it may already be too late. It is for me.

Anyway, for you folks who want to support your depressed friends and family. **They need to spend time with you, they need to know that they are needed.** Only texting and voicemails are not helpful. Convincing yourself that you tried or reached out, only through texting, or forwarding social media posts, or leaving voicemails is not doing them any good. Your conscience is satiated, and they are left with empty gestures.

If you can spend time with them physically, allowing them to share and contribute to life with you, allowing them to feel needed, this is what will help. Not empty gestures of texts, voicemails or 'social' media. If safe, just make it happen. Don't ask for permission, plan something to do together. They need to spend quality time with you, they don't need your clever quips, texts, voicemails or forwarded social media garbage. If they are deep in their depression hole (likely the case) they need you to go to them and help them get out of it. You may have to be uncomfortable to do this, or make a sacrifice of time. If you aren't physically spending time with them, it's not happening. Try to listen to them, and hear them. They need your support to just listen and in that process, something will surface they can work with to help dig themselves out. We need to be together physically. Maybe cook something together, or go on a walk, or whatever. Something simple, they can participate together with you where they are necessary and will feel needed as a result. Texting, voicemails and social media are not helping."
"I have to be busy by something every second. I can't allow myself to be alone with myself because I get drenched in loneliness and dread. When I'm around people I'm drenched in anxiety and self doubt. ,,I can‚Äôt be with people and I can‚Äôt be alone."". It makes me so suicidal. Having 0 friends (After losing them to depression [or them being dicks]) and no confidence is a death sentence in this world. I could have been just collecting berries and sitting in the cave without having thoughts but now because of our ancestors I'm doomed to be social creature. Its just a torture made by years of evolution. I can't allow myself to think because thinking makes me feel bad. I can't even let myself think while trying to fall asleep, I have to create scenarios, movies in my head just not to think about my sad life ,, Look at my sad life in detail and you'll see it is a comedy. Sometimes I wish I was a goat, sometimes I wish I was a goat"". Diagnosis that I'm probably going to get (Therapist is certain, now just psychiatrist has to decide) isnt going to make it easier (BPD and/or APVD) with already diagnosed depression isn't going to make it easier. Isn't it just a sign of life itself kicking me while I lay down so I finally think to myself ,,Huh, I should bury myself"" and end it? Is it a sign from universe? Existance is pain and events in my life are just assuring that message."
"I'm honestly tired of living atp. I've tried being the good kid, scoring the good marks, always aced test and did pretty good.

I hid it for nearly 6 to 7 years but all that time I kept hating my family internally for not understanding me or for not taking the time to understand me.

I feel ashamed to admit how big of a hater I've become. The other day I broke an entire door out of anger. I was never this person. I grew up as the sweetest kid ever but idk how n when I turned into this monster. I constantly keep having fights with my family, my boyfriend, my friends. I have come to terms with the fact that I am the asshole. My parents are atp just tolerating me for the sake that I'm their child and ik my boyfriend is tired of me too.

I ended up leaving him in the middle of the night with my infant. It‚Äôs been nearly two years since I left. My son is the light of my world but everything else feels so unending. I‚Äôve tried dating but it‚Äôs only accumulated to me sleeping with a bunch of people who don‚Äôt truly care about me. I feel horrible about myself. I hate my life. I feel like no one wants me and I just keep doing the same hurtful things to myself to break me more. I don‚Äôt know how to get out of this cycle and move on and live a happy life. "
"Whether you need help to understand why the issues you are dealing with are happening, why certain people seem to always treat you certain way, feeling like you are the problem, feel like no one likes you or everyone hates you, why situations seem to always start one way and end in another, why you feel or think the way you do, why you react the way you do, why someone ELSE reacts the way they do, who or what the actual issue is in certain relationships, why someone did or said something, struggling with an addiction or phobia - ***ETC!***....

IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT IS - I'M NEVER GOING TO JUDGE YOU AND I JUST WANT THEBEST FOR YOU BECAUSE EVERYONE DESERVES LOVE AND HAPPINESS!!"
"My dad died 1.5 years ago but I am feeling depressed now, I feel it is all my fault, because it is. There was a fire in my house and he died saving me. I didnt feel much back then, I just distracted myself, but now everyday I am suffering. Can someone please help"
"Does anyone just hope they can force their way out of depression?  I keep hoping and trying.  I keep hoping ill wake up and the meds will work.  Sometimes I do not feel like im trying hard enough.  I goto try to be productive then my mind sinks and it thinks what is the point .  Everytime i get a glimmer of hope, then I think of everything else it takes to do daily tasks, i have total apathy.  Zero motivation.  How does anyone fight this ?"
In a bad spot. I can't find joy in anything. Everything hurts all the time. I can't find joy in my love or my children or my family or my pets. Everything slipping. Relationship is crumbling right this very moment. I can't keep a job. I have nothing of value and barely the means or the energy to support myself. 
"My name is Ruger, I‚Äôm 15, I‚Äôm not doing well anymore. My mother laughs at me when I failed the attempts and my father is manipulating.my friends are leaving me and the only girl I felt true love for is gone, she left without a reason and I was the nicest I could be. I may have been touchy but that‚Äôs me, I told you that. It‚Äôs been awhile and I thought I could get over you, but I still think about her. The relationship was 4 months. I still remember her birthday, before the relationship we were very good friends but now she dosent even bother send me anything. I believe I did something. Should I just end it. I can use a g0n it would be easy and fast."
"My health has deteriorated so much that I could not work properly. So I resigned. I have this eerie feeling of relief and doubt.

I am not sure if this is the right decision, well I have a long notice period to serve. So whatever."
"because i feel like i fucking suck at them. no matter how manageable my depression gets, one bad episode and i feel like i ruin everything"
"I‚Äòm suffering depression and social anxiety (main course of my depression) since I was 15 (diagnosed), but tbh the symptoms were present since I was born. 

I tried over 15 meds prescribed by professionals (SSRI, SNRI, tetracyclic, tricyclic, wellbutrin and other atypicals, even 2 antipsychotics, 2 benzos etc.). I also tried 3 talk therapies (2 analytical + 1 CBT) as well as hypnosis. I tried so damn many supplements or nootropics. Nothing has helped. I really have to get back alive and a life again. I don‚Äòt want it to end. But like this I slowly die, my mental health gets worse, my physical due to it, too (not eating, drinking, moving, going out, seeing people).

In times when I don‚Äòt have no obligations like a job or seminars at university for some time that drag me out of my house I really vegetate in my bed and socially isolate myself - depression &amp; anxiety is so extreme then, it‚Äôs no joke when I say it feels as if I would be chained to the bed and physically restricted. I don‚Äòt eat, drink enough, get no movement, don‚Äôt get outside, fresh air or see people in those times. I really just vegetate from one day into another, lonely in my bed. Right now it is one of those times - bound to bed like a wrack for almost 2 weeks again.

Even if I‚Äòve been pretty treatment-resistant so far my doc is sure my issues definitely have a biochemical source and we must find something (a missing chemical) that will finally reduce my symptoms and make life livable. I mean there‚Äòs just not a lot still to try anymore.

Maybe MAOIs (but many restrictions as diet, BP‚Ä¶) Maybe ADHD meds (I know Ritalin helped me tons when my cousin gave it to me to try but docs never wanted to test me on ADD before they didn‚Äòt treat my depression &amp; anxiety, quite some nonsense). Maybe other benzos (I only tried diazepam &amp; lorazepam, maybe these just were the wrong pick?). Maybe psychedelics (but I can‚Äôt tell I‚Äôm ever in the right state of mind to be sure to get a safe good and no bad trip - I mean, I already get bad anxiety and panic from weed/THC). Maybe Ketamine therapy or rTMS etc?

What substance (may it be a prescription drug, illicit, supplement, nootropic, herb, RC or whatever) decreased your anxiety and shyness and improved your mood, energy and drive to get out and socialize, your sociability and talkativeness? 

I finally want a normal life! I finally have to be able to live and have a normal life because soon my Master‚Äòs degree ends and then I have to get back to work again, also finally want to find a love, create new friendships and family.

I would really be so thankful for any help or suggestions!"
"I occasionally listen to a few podcasts/interviews with professionals about mental health. I phrase that comes up often (and that I am paraphrasing here for brevity) is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt suicide because we, as society, need you‚Äù.

But there never go on to say for what. What do you need us for? And why do you need us?"
"(F 15)I dont know what to do. In the last 36 hours ive been blackmailed, lost all my friends and a partner, and almost went back to the mental hospital because I wouldnt be friends with somebody. My mother wont speak to me unless its to tell me I just cause problems. I feel like dying. I just want to hear somebody say they care again. that they believe me. that I matter "
"I need some advice. I have very intense adhd and depression and my room has become pretty much unwalkable. its an embarrassment and i know i would feel so much better if i just. *cleaned*. ***it***. but my problem is i get about 50 minutes in and get frustrated at the sheer amount of cleaning i know i need to do and rage quit. ive tried listening to podcasts, music, watching ""clean with me"" videos, everything. the only other idea i have is recording myself so i feel like i cant take a break bc my imaginary audience will see (come on we all pretend were famous youtubers dont lie)   
  
are there any tips/tricks you all have used or honestly just words of encouragement would be appreciated. "
"I'm a 16 yrs old male still in highschool and trying my best to keep my grades good by having awards and keeping Straight A's but everytime I come home I would always hear stuff from my mom and step dad like ""Do better"". I always follow their rules never broke a single one yet they still find ways to belittle me or find excuses to get mad at me like earlier for example I went home late at 6pm since our school dismissal was at 5pm and my house was pretty far. After I arrived home I didn't even here them say atleast a Hi or a ""I'm glad your ok"". All I heard was shouting accusing me of doing drugs and hanging out with bad friends and all the stuff parents accuse you of stuff you do. I get it it's normal but they didn't even sound concerned they just shouted and shouted not even listening to me or my reason why I went home late. I've been considering ending it all for the last months but something in me just doesn't wanna do it."
"Tw: SA
To start off I am a 23 y/o female, so it‚Äôs honestly embarrassing to be scared of the dark. Some times it‚Äôs more than just scared though. My husband says we can get a night light if it will help but that just feels more embarrassing. I believe my fear stems from being extremely SA‚Äôd by a family friend for 2 years when I was 6 till I was 8. It always happened at night and well I was sleeping or trying to sleep. It caused me to fear sleeping at friends houses cuz I‚Äôd fear that their siblings or parents would do things to me. Now I just fear things existing in the dark. I feel crazy and just don‚Äôt want to anymore. 

Edit: I mean this in the nicest way please don‚Äôt use my trauma as a way to push religion on me. You guys are free to message me, but don‚Äôt push your religion on me. You only are reading about a very small part in my life and I would appreciate if you don‚Äôt tell me I need to turn to god and other things. Thank you! "
"I have been experiencing worst kind of depression since my break up. Very intense and the worst kind I have ever felt in life. 

I don't feel like getting up from bed, don't feel like brushing but I do. I don't shower daily. Don't laundry my clothes. Eating only one meal a day just because my co-workers insists. I don't feel like socialising or talking to anyone. I am not doing a good job in my corporate work and disappointing everyone. Breaking down all the time in my room and in restroom at work. I am really scared for my future and how I am going to take care of my parents when I am like this. 

I am wishing death would take upon me soon. I wish nobody was relying on me and I was allowed to stay isolated in a room until I pass out and pass away. I am not the kind who posts online for any hardships. Idk what I am looking for here. I am really suffering a lot internally when trying to look normal for people outside."
