"So recently me (18M) and my gf (18F) went to a halloween party. I was already uncomfortable with her going because a bunch of her co-workers were going to be there, and they try flirting with her even while at work. While we were there she got very drunk fast. (she’s a lightweight) In the room full of the guy co workers, my gf and I were sitting together and her guy co-worker that I told her about that I absolutely do not like was also sitting next to her. So it was me, her and her co-worker. She touched on his leg to get his attention to play with game with her and it honestly made me feel like shit, but it was a drinking game and I was the sober driver so I guess it’s understandable. Suddenly two girls came rushing into the room asking people if they want to play spin the bottle. Those two girls said “Who wants to play spin the bottle, you can’t play if you’re in a relationship though” My gf proceeds to say “IM NOT” in front of everyone in the room. I could hear the guy co-workers in disbelief and they were all kinda smiley idk. I don’t know how to feel. It honestly hurt my feelings for sure especially now knowing she’s been snapchatting that guy co-worker I hate. They snapped each other 6 times in one day. (which was today) I don’t know what to do, I feel disrespected and violated. I don’t know if I should break things off. I already tried to but it was honestly so hard to and I backed off and took it back. She was crying a lot. From the start I promised her I would stay to the end but I don’t know if I can if I keep getting disrespected.




UPDATE: Thank you all for your opinions and support, I really appreciate y’all fr. It’s going to be over between us and thankfully all of you have made me see it though. This was my first relationship, so thank you for honestly giving out advice about this situation. Have a blessed day and again thank you. 🙏","yakın zamanda ben ve kız arkadaşım bir cadılar bayramı partisine gittik ben zaten onun gitmesinden rahatsızdım çünkü bir sürü iş arkadaşı orada olacaktı ve biz oradayken bile onunla flört etmeye çalıştılar çok hızlı sarhoş oldu odadaki erkek iş arkadaşlarıyla dolu bir yerde hafif sıkletti kız arkadaşım ve ben birlikte oturuyorduk ve ona hiç hoşlanmadığımı söylediğim erkek iş arkadaşı da onun yanında oturuyordu bu yüzden ben ve iş arkadaşıydık dikkatini çekmek için bacağına dokundu onunla oyun oynamak için ve dürüst olmak gerekirse kendimi bok gibi hissettim ama bu bir içki oyunuydu ve ben ayık sürücüydüm bu yüzden sanırım anlaşılabilir bir durum aniden odaya iki kız daldı insanlara şişe çevirmece oynamak isteyip istemediklerini sordular o iki kız şişe çevirmece oynamak isteyen var mı dediler eğer bir ilişkin varsa oynayamazsın ama kız arkadaşım devam edip odadaki herkesin önünde olmadığımı söyledi erkek iş arkadaşlarının inanmaz bir şekilde seslerini duyabiliyordum ve hepsi biraz gülümsüyordu bilmiyorum nasıl hissedeceğimi bilmiyorum dürüst olmak gerekirse incindim duygularım kesinlikle özellikle şimdi o adamın iş arkadaşıyla snapchat yaptığını bildiğim için nefret ediyorum bir günde birbirlerinin fotoğraflarını çektiler, bugün ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum saygısızlığa uğramış ve ihlal edilmiş hissediyorum ilişkiyi bitirmeli miyim bilmiyorum zaten denedim ama dürüst olmak gerekirse çok zordu ve geri çekildim ve geri aldım en başından beri çok ağlıyordu ona sonuna kadar kalacağıma söz verdim ama saygısızlık görmeye devam edersem kalabilir miyim bilmiyorum

Hi. Tonight my husband and I were eating dinner and my friend got in a fight with her boyfriend. My friend’s boyfriend grabbed my friend’s hair and forced her down to the ground and kicked her. My husband pushed her boyfriend and beat his face with his phone and he got arrested. The police told me he will get released tomorrow. He was defending my friend who was on the ground so I don’t know what crime he committed. What do I do???,Merhaba bu gece kocam ve ben akşam yemeği yiyorduk ve arkadaşım erkek arkadaşıyla kavga etti arkadaşımın erkek arkadaşı arkadaşımın saçını tuttu ve onu yere yatırıp tekmeledi kocam erkek arkadaşını itti ve telefonuyla suratına vurdu ve tutuklandı polis bana yarın serbest bırakılacağını söyledi yerde yatan arkadaşımı savunuyordu bu yüzden ne suç işlediğini bilmiyorum ne yapmalıyım
"So last night my wife f61 and I m61were talking in bed after some spicy activities. And her phone rings it is her ex husband whom she has been divorced from for 38 years. He had her number because his current wife and my wife know each other professionally. They got married about 10 years after the divorce. So my wife says should she answer it we don't but he keeps calling. Thinking something bad had happened to his wife my wife answered put her phone on speaker. The man is drunk off his ass. Starts professing his love for her biggest mistake he ever did was cheating on her. Saying how lucky I am. And more of the same for about 5 minutes before we both told him to go to sleep. Then he starts crying about how he fucked up his life. And on and on till we just hung up. No my wife is not cheating. He lives over a 1000 miles away.
The question is to I contact him soon and tell him to knock it off. First time my wife has spoken to him in 27 years.
Some ideas for a text response to embarrass him would also be liked.","dün gece karım f ve ben baharatlı aktivitelerden sonra yatakta konuşuyorduk ve telefonu çaldı yıllardır boşandığı eski kocasıydı numarasını biliyordu çünkü şu anki karısıyla karım birbirlerini profesyonel olarak tanıyorlardı boşandıktan yıllar sonra evlendiler bu yüzden karım telefonu açmalı mı açmamalıyız diyor ama karısına kötü bir şey olduğunu düşünerek aramaya devam ediyor karım açtı telefonunu hoparlöre aldı adam sarhoştu ona olan aşkını itiraf etmeye başladı yaptığı en büyük hata karısını aldatmaktı ne kadar şanslı olduğumu söyledi ve bunun gibi daha birçok şey ikimiz de ona uyumasını söyleyene kadar dakikalarca böyle devam etti sonra hayatını mahvettiği için ağlamaya başladı ve telefonu kapatana kadar hayır karım aldatmıyor benden kilometrelerce uzakta yaşıyor
soru şu ki yakında onunla iletişime geçip bırakmasını söylemeliyim karım onunla yıllardır ilk kez konuşuyor
onu utandıracak bir mesaj cevabı için bazı fikirler de beğenilebilir"
"I know by reading the title you’re probably going to say the answer is obvious and I should leave him but it’s not that simple. My husband (26M) and me (26F) have been together since we were 15. Though I liked him for about 2 years before that. I love him more than anything. I would do anything for him. I literally can’t imagine my life without him. But something happened and I don’t know what to do. 

My husband has always been a nature flirt even when we were kids. He says he doesn’t realize he’s flirting and doesn’t mean to. This has lead to a few women thinking he’s flirting with them. But he has always assured me that he doesn’t mean to and that he loves me and would never do that to me. This has caused a slight insecurity in me but he was always so loving with me and I trusted him. 

But a few days ago he went to a bar with a couple of his friends. I wasn’t feeling well so I fell asleep pretty early and I was woken up by him the next morning. He said he had to tell me something. To sum up what he said, he got pretty drunk at the bar and he ended up kissing one of our friends, let’s call her Jenny(25F). They only kissed and both regretted it after. He doesn’t know why he did it.

I was crying throughout this entire conversation and he just said he was sorry but it was only a kiss and didn’t mean anything. Now I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to divorce him. Our lives have become so Intertwined that divorce would be like separating two worlds. I mean we have a house together. We were planing on kids in a few months. Our family’s all love each other and we had the perfect marriage before this. 

I told him I needed a couple days to think and he said ok and left to go stay at his sisters place. Now I don’t know what to do. I love him and don’t want to leave him over one kiss but knowing he kissed another women is killing me. Has anyone been in a situation like this? Should I talk with Jenny before I talk to him? If anyone has any advice please let me know. I have a few days until I have to face him again so I need help.

LITTLE UPDATE: So I called Jenny and she answered immediately. She started apologizing and I said I had questions. She said we can talk in person so yea. We’re meeting up in a few hours. Wish me luck. 

UPDATE 3 DAYS LATER: Sorry for keeping you guys waiting I’ve been busy these past couple of days. I guess this isn’t really an update just an explanation but here you go. So I had the talk with Jenny. We met at a park and she apologized again and promised that there was nothing romantic going on between her and my husband. They had just gotten to drunk and did something stupid.

 I asked her to explain what happened in detail and she said that they got carried away and drank a lot. Everyone that went (it was a group of 5 people) was drinking a lot and was just letting loose. Then they started dancing but two of the friends left cause they had gotten tired and the other one walked away to flirt with a girl so it was just them. Apparently it was harmless dancing until she noticed how close they were and leaned in to kiss him. (Yes she initiated the kiss)

He just stood there then they both realized what happened and pulled away. She apologized and he just said he had to go and left. She said she just got caught up in the moment and regretted it a lot. She said she understood if I never wanted to talk to her again and if I wanted her and my husband’s friendship to end. She was crying throughout all of this and I just said I would think about what I wanted and left. 

I called the friends that were at the bar with them and the two that left confirmed the story up until they left and the one that left to flirt with a girl said that after he was done flirting with the girl my husband came up to him, said he was leaving, and left quickly and he was confused. Jenny looked sad and also left after that. So yea. That’s the explanation. I’m going to talk to my husband tomorrow and I’ll uploaded and let you know how that goes. 

As of right now. No I’m not going to leave him. If everything is true and that’s what happened then I’m going to stay. I love him to much to leave him over a kiss. I know some of you are going to call me stupid and naive but I can’t just throw away a 11 year relationship. I’m going to set boundaries definitely and put my foot down but I’m not going to divorce him.

EDIT: When I said he just stood there I didn’t mean he didn’t kiss back. She kissed him. He kissed back. And then they both pulled away after a few seconds. ","Başlığı okuyarak cevabın açık olduğunu ve onu terk etmem gerektiğini söyleyeceğinizi biliyorum ama bu kadar basit değil kocam ve ben k, biz olduğumuzdan beri birlikteyiz ama ondan yaklaşık birkaç yıl önce onu seviyordum, onu her şeyden çok seviyordum, onun için her şeyi yapardım, kelimenin tam anlamıyla onsuz hayatımı hayal edemiyorum ama bir şey oldu ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum

kocam her zaman bir doğa flörtçüsüydü, çocukken bile flört ettiğinin farkında olmadığını ve bunu kastetmediğini söylüyor, bu da birkaç kadının onunla flört ettiğini düşünmesine yol açtı ama bana bunu kastetmediğini ve beni sevdiğini ve bana asla böyle bir şey yapmayacağını söyledi, bu bende hafif bir güvensizlik yarattı ama bana karşı her zaman çok sevgi doluydu ve ona güvendim

ama birkaç gün önce birkaç arkadaşıyla bir bara gitti, iyi hissetmiyordum, bu yüzden oldukça erken uyuyakaldım ve ertesi sabah beni uyandırdı, bana söylediklerini özetlemek için bir şeyler söylemesi gerektiğini söyledi, barda oldukça sarhoş oldu ve sonunda birini öptü arkadaşlarımız ona jenny diyelim sadece öpüştüler ve ikisi de pişman oldu sonra neden yaptığını bilmiyor

bu konuşma boyunca ağladım ve o sadece özür diledi ama sadece bir öpücüktü ve hiçbir şey ifade etmiyordu şimdi ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum ondan boşanmak istemiyorum hayatlarımız o kadar iç içe geçti ki boşanmak iki dünyayı ayırmak gibi yani birlikte bir evimiz var birkaç ay içinde çocuk yapmayı planlıyorduk ailelerimiz birbirini seviyor ve bundan önce mükemmel bir evliliğimiz vardı

ona düşünmek için birkaç güne ihtiyacım olduğunu söyledim ve tamam dedi ve kız kardeşinin evinde kalmaya gitti şimdi ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum onu ​​seviyorum ve onu bir öpücük yüzünden bırakmak istemiyorum ama başka bir kadını öptüğünü bilmek beni öldürüyor böyle bir durum yaşayan oldu mu jenny ile konuşmadan önce konuşmalı mıyım eğer birinin tavsiyesi varsa lütfen bana bildirin onunla tekrar yüzleşmem gereken birkaç günüm var bu yüzden yardıma ihtiyacım var

küçük bir güncelleme jenny'i aradım ve hemen açtı özür dilemeye başladı ve ben de sorularım olduğunu söyledim dedi şahsen konuşabiliriz bu yüzden birkaç saat içinde buluşuyoruz bana şans dileyin

günler sonra güncelleme sizi beklettiğim için özür dilerim son birkaç gündür meşguldüm sanırım bu gerçekten bir güncelleme değil sadece bir açıklama ama işte jenny ile konuştum bir parkta tanıştık ve tekrar özür diledi ve kendisi ile kocam arasında romantik bir şey olmadığına söz verdi sadece çok içmişlerdi ve aptalca bir şey yapmışlardı

ne olduğunu ayrıntılı olarak açıklamasını istedim ve kendilerini kaptırdıklarını ve çok içtiklerini söyledi herkes çok içiyordu ve rahatladılar sonra dans etmeye başladılar ama arkadaşlarından ikisi yorgun oldukları için gitti ve diğeri bir kızla flört etmek için uzaklaştı yani sadece onlar vardı görünüşe göre zararsız bir danstı ta ki ne kadar yakın olduklarını fark edene ve onu öpmek için eğilene kadar evet öpücüğü o başlattı

o sadece orada durdu sonra ikisi de ne olduğunu anladılar ve geri çekildiler özür diledi ve o sadece gitmesi gerektiğini söyledi ve gitti o sadece o anın büyüsüne kapıldığını ve çok pişman olduğunu söyledi eğer onunla bir daha asla konuşmak istemedim ve eğer onun ve kocamın arkadaşlığının bitmesini isteseydim tüm bunlar boyunca ağlıyordu ve ben sadece ne istediğimi düşüneceğimi söyledim ve ayrıldım

onlarla barda olan arkadaşlarımı aradım ve ayrılan ikisi de hikayeyi doğruladı ta ki ayrılana kadar ve bir kızla flört etmek için ayrılan kişi, kızla flört etmeyi bitirdikten sonra kocamın yanına gelip gideceğini ve hemen ayrıldığını ve kafasının karıştığını söyledi jenny üzgün görünüyordu ve ondan sonra da ayrıldı, bu yüzden evet açıklama bu yarın kocamla konuşacağım ve yükleyeceğim ve size nasıl gittiğini bildireceğim

şu an itibariyle hayır onu terk etmeyeceğim eğer her şey doğruysa ve olan buysa o zaman kalacağım onu ​​bir öpücük için terk edecek kadar çok seviyorum biliyorum bazılarınız bana aptal ve saf diyecek ama bir yıllık ilişkiyi öylece çöpe atamam kesinlikle sınırlar koyacağım ve ayağımı yere vuracağım ama ondan boşanmayacağım

düzenle orada öylece durduğunu söylediğimde geri öpmediği anlamına gelmediğini söyledim onu öptüm, o da öptü ve sonra ikisi de birkaç saniye sonra uzaklaştılar"

**Original post summary:**  
For those of you who didn’t see my original post, here’s a brief summary:

In my previous post, I shared some difficult suspicions about my wife, who recently became increasingly close to a 17-year-old boy she coaches. She started making strange comments about his looks, athletic abilities, and personal qualities that went beyond her usual enthusiasm for coaching. Meanwhile, she’s become much more secretive with her phone and is often late home from practice without clear explanations. These changes have left me wondering if there’s something more happening between them, but I don’t have solid proof and don’t want to jump to conclusions without evidence.

**Late update**:  
First off, I want to thank everyone for the comments, advice, and support on my original post. Unfortunately, my original post was initially taken down, and I received a three-day temporary ban from the subreddit. Thankfully, the post was eventually restored after my ban ended. Since I wasn’t able to share updates during that time, I’ve decided to create a new post with all the updates so far, structured chronologically to keep everything organized. Sorry to keep everyone waiting—this is why I’m only updating now, and the last five days have also been a whirlwind.

**Post update 1:**  
I took some of your advice and reached out to a lawyer—well, sort of. An old friend from high school, who’s now a successful family lawyer, happens to be visiting this week. While family law isn’t exactly what I need, I’d rather speak to someone I trust before hiring a lawyer and potentially escalating things out of control.

I’m meeting him for coffee tomorrow and will update you afterward. I’m hoping he can give me some solid legal advice without things getting too intense. I obviously don’t want her to be arrested or anything drastic like that, but I also don’t know what to do next. Right now, I’m not even angry—just overwhelmed and in shock. It’s hard to process that someone I’ve been so close to over the last two years might not be who I thought and could have been hiding something awful this whole time.

**Post update 2:**  
The last five days have been absolute hell. The title is a bit of a giveaway, but pretty much everyone who commented was right, and my own suspicions have been confirmed.

After talking to my friend (the lawyer), we agreed that I should confront her with my concerns suggest looking through her phone together just to put some of my suspicions to rest. I realise how risky this was, but we really didn’t have a lot of choice considering there was no clear proof that anything weird had been going on.  
He suggested that we meet somewhere quiet, but still in a public setting in case she decided to freak out and do something irrational. I decided to take her our local park where I sat her down on a park bench well away from any crowds of people.

When we sat down together, I told her how serious of a situation we could be in and that she MUST be completely honest with me, and that want to be on her side but the way she had been acting had led to some serious suspicions. I explained to her that I didn’t want to break the trust between us so had decided against looking through her phone, despite how tempted I was.

When I told her the concerns, she immediately got defensive and started denying everything. She called me a “paranoid asshole” for even suggesting that she would be in a relationship with a minor. She said the fact that I would even question something like this means there’s probably something wrong with me and that I must be the one hiding something.

Honestly, the way she reacted just confirmed to me that there was something that she hadn’t been telling me this entire time and that without her cooperation, the safest bet was probably just to leave.

I suggested that we look through her phone together just to provide ME with closure and even if there was nothing to hide, it would mean a lot to me that she would just humour me and that it might even be fun to look through together and laugh at how ridiculous I was being.

She screamed at me for “trying to invade her privacy” and that I had massively overstepped the line before storming away from me, back to the car and driving to her friend’s house to stay for the night.

I don’t know what she talked about with her friend but at around 3:00 am the next morning I got a really long text from her giving her view of the situation. The messages was as follows (the entire message was considerably long so I’ve summarised it for this post): My wife - I really don’t think what I have been doing is wrong, it started with me just helping this kid with some extra practice because he was struggling to get the hang of some of the drills we had been working on in that days training session. These private sessions were becoming more regular and after about three weeks of extra training sessions he sent me a friend request to my Instagram. He wasn’t the first one of the team to send me a request and I wouldn’t usually accept them but as I was giving this kid private coaching sessions I though it made more sense.  
He started to send me DMs so I responded, because I’m not a total asshole. Ok, maybe the texts aren’t just about soccer anymore, there’s nothing wrong with being friends with a kid, you’ve always been super close to your younger brother and I’ve never called you out for being “weird”.

The message then proceeded to say how much of an asshole I was for trying to call her out and trapping her in a situation that would always leave her looking bad.

She ended the message by telling me that she thinks that she’ll be able to look past this and forgive me for being a “total insecure dickhead” and that if I ever questioned her like this again, she would be filing for a divorce.

I was in complete shock when I read this response as I have never seen this side to my wife. This is not the kind, loving, respectful, and open person whom i had married and it is driving me totally insane, I just don’t know what to do.

I understand that what she was telling me is not normal and I can’t believe how naïve I have been for so long, but I still feel like there’s even more going on that she’s not telling me. Her long message didn’t actually explain why she had been messaging this kid so much and for so long, or why she had been spending literal hours every evening locked in our bedroom or on the sofa just on her phone.

IDK, maybe I AM just being paranoid?

Maybe this is more normal than I’m making it out to be, although this seems unlikely.

Should I still try to look through her phone anyway, despite what she’s told me?

When we had met the previous day, my friend mentioned that this was out of his field but that I shouldn’t contact the police until I was more sure of anything because if we did end up getting a divorce, and she is technically innocent, calling the police on your wife for providing extra help to a kid she coaches wouldn’t look very good for me in a courtroom.

**Again, I apologise to everyone for the late update, and I know this post is kind of all over the place, but I hope you have been able to follow.**

**Edit:** This post was temporarily removed but has now been reinstated. I appreciate all the support and advice so far, and I’ll be responding to comments to answer questions and clear up any confusion. I will be giving another update on the development of the situation, thank you for your patience!","heres the link to my previous post for those who wanted to go back and read it httpswwwredditcomradvicecommentsgahddbithinkmywifemightbecheatingonmewithautmsourceshareamputmmediumwebxamputmnamewebxcssamputmtermamputmcontentsharebuttonhttpswwwredditcomradvicecommentsgahddbithinkmywifemightbecheatingonmewithautmsourceshareamputmmediumwebxamputmnamewebxcssamputmtermamputmcontentsharebutton

bana DM atmaya başladı bu yüzden cevap verdim çünkü ben tam bir pislik değilim tamam belki de mesajlar artık sadece futbolla ilgili değil bir çocukla arkadaş olmakta yanlış bir şey yok küçük kardeşine her zaman çok yakın oldun ve seni tuhaf olduğun için hiç uyarmadım

mesaj daha sonra onu uyarmaya ve onu her zaman kötü görünecek bir duruma düşürmeye çalıştığım için ne kadar pislik olduğumu söylemeye başladı

mesajı bana bunun ötesine bakabileceğini ve tam bir güvensiz pislik olduğum için beni affedebileceğini ve eğer onu bir daha böyle sorgularsam boşanma davası açacağını söyleyerek bitirdi

bu cevabı okuduğumda tamamen şok oldum karımın bu tarafını hiç görmediğimden, evlendiğim kişi bu kadar nazik, sevgi dolu, saygılı ve açık bir insan değildi ve bu beni tamamen deli ediyor, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum

bana söylediklerinin normal olmadığını anlıyorum ve bu kadar uzun süredir ne kadar saf olduğuma inanamıyorum ama bana söylememesi daha da fazla şey olduğunu hissediyorum, uzun mesajı aslında bu çocuğa neden bu kadar çok ve bu kadar uzun süre mesaj attığını veya her akşam kelimenin tam anlamıyla saatlerini yatak odamızda veya kanepede sadece telefonuyla geçirerek geçirdiğini açıklamıyordu

bilmiyorum belki de sadece paranoyaklaşıyorum

belki de bu benim gösterdiğimden daha normaldir, ancak bu pek olası görünmüyor

bana söylediklerine rağmen yine de telefonuna bakmaya çalışmalı mıyım

önceki gün tanıştığımızda arkadaşım bunun kendi alanı dışında olduğunu ancak daha fazla emin olana kadar polise başvurmamam gerektiğini söyledi çünkü eğer boşanırsak ve teknik olarak masumsa, koçluk yaptığı bir çocuğa ekstra yardım sağladığı için eşinizi polise şikayet etmeli mahkeme salonunda benim için pek iyi gözükmezdi

"Alright, I never thought I’d be in this situation, but I’m completely at a loss here and I need some advice. My wife (33F) has been acting really strange lately, and I’m starting to think she might be cheating on me… with one of the kids she coaches. I feel sick even typing that.

Some background: my wife is an accountant by day, and in the evenings, she volunteers as a soccer coach for a local youth team. She's always loved soccer, and I thought it was great that she was so involved with the kids and the community. But recently, she’s been dropping weird comments that are starting to really concern me.

It all started about two months ago. She casually mentioned one of the boys on her team — he’s 17, and I won’t say his name for obvious reasons. At first, it was harmless stuff, like “He’s really talented for his age” or “He’s a natural leader on the field.” I didn’t think much of it because, well, she’s a coach, and it’s her job to encourage the kids, right?

But then the comments started to get...weird. Like one night, out of nowhere, she said, “You know, \[kid’s name\] has really pretty eyes. They’re so striking.” I remember thinking, ""Uh, that’s an odd thing to say about a kid you're coaching."" I kind of brushed it off at first, but then more things followed.

Another time, she came home after practice and said, “He’s so much more athletic than anyone else on the team. It’s impressive how developed he is.” Again, I tried to shake it off, but my gut started nagging at me. Why is she talking about him so much?

Then there’s the fact that she’s been getting way more secretive. She’s always been open with her phone and emails, but lately, she’s been turning her screen away from me when she texts or checks messages. I asked her about it, and she just laughed it off, saying I was being paranoid.

She’s also been staying later and later after practices. At first, she told me it was just because they were prepping for some tournament, but now, even with the tournament over, she’s still coming home late. When I ask, she gives vague excuses like, “Oh, the team needed extra help,” or “I had some paperwork to catch up on.”

Here’s the thing that really has me spiraling: Last week, I came home early from work. I expected to have the house to myself since she was supposed to be at practice, but when I walked in, I found her sitting on the couch, texting someone with a huge smile on her face. When she saw me, she quickly locked her phone and got super flustered. She said it was ""just one of the parents asking about game schedules,"" but it didn’t feel right.

I don’t have any solid proof, but something just feels *off*. Why would she be talking about this kid’s looks? Why is she suddenly so secretive? I haven’t been able to shake the feeling that something more is going on.

I don’t want to accuse her of something so serious without any real evidence, but I also don’t want to ignore my instincts. I love her, and I really don’t want to believe she’d do something like this, especially with a kid she’s supposed to be mentoring.

So, Reddit, what should I do? Am I reading too much into this? Is she cheating on me with this 17-year-old, or am I just being paranoid? How do I even begin to confront her about something like this?

Any advice would be appreciated. I’m honestly feeling lost right now.

**Updates:**

Hi everyone,

First off, I want to thank all of you for the overwhelming amount of comments, advice, and support on my original post. I really needed some sense knocked into me, and I genuinely appreciate the community’s input—it has meant a lot during this confusing time.

After reading your comments, I took some of your advice and contacted my lawyer on the evening of my original post. I’ll go into more details about that shortly, but before diving into the updates, I’d like to clarify why this post is coming out now and in this format.

Unfortunately, after posting, my original post was taken down and I received a three-day ban from the subreddit. Thankfully, the post was later restored, but I had to wait until the ban lifted to share updates. I did keep track of each development and wrote them out as they happened, so I’ll be sharing them in chronological order, just as I intended from the start.

I am posting the updates on a new post because there is so much to say, and I think creating a new post is best for organising all of the updates in a clear manner. In the update post will include a link to the original post for those who may not of seen it.","tamam, böyle bir durumda olacağımı hiç düşünmezdim ama burada tamamen kayboldum ve biraz tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var, karım f son zamanlarda gerçekten garip davranıyor ve beni koçluk yaptığı çocuklardan biriyle aldatıyor olabileceğini düşünmeye başlıyorum, bunu yazarken bile midem bulanıyor

biraz geçmiş bilgisi karım gündüzleri muhasebeci ve akşamları yerel bir gençlik takımında gönüllü olarak futbol koçluğu yapıyor, futbolu her zaman sevmiştir ve çocuklarla ve toplumla bu kadar iç içe olması harika bir şeydi ama son zamanlarda beni gerçekten endişelendirmeye başlayan garip yorumlar yapmaya başladı

her şey yaklaşık iki ay önce başladı, takımındaki çocuklardan birinden bahsetti ve ilk başta bariz sebeplerden dolayı ismini söylemeyeceğim, yaşına göre gerçekten yetenekli olduğu veya sahada doğal bir lider olduğu gibi zararsız şeylerdi, pek önemsemedim çünkü o bir koç ve çocukları cesaretlendirmek onun işi değil mi

ama sonra yorumlar tuhaflaşmaya başladı, bir gece ansızın geldi, bilirsin, çocuğun adı çok güzel gözlere sahip, çok çarpıcı, uh, bunun garip olduğunu düşündüğümü hatırlıyorum koçluk yaptığın bir çocuk hakkında söylenecek bir şey ilk başta önemsemedim ama sonra başka şeyler de oldu

başka bir sefer antrenmandan sonra eve geldi ve takımda diğerlerinden çok daha atletik olduğunu söyledi, ne kadar gelişmiş olduğu etkileyici, yine atlatmaya çalıştım ama içimden bir ses bana neden bu kadar çok ondan bahsettiğini sordu

sonra çok daha gizemli olmaya başladı, telefonu ve e-postalarıyla her zaman açıktı ama son zamanlarda mesaj attığında veya mesajları kontrol ettiğinde ekranını benden uzaklaştırıyor, ona bunu sordum ve paranoyak olduğumu söyleyerek güldü

ayrıca antrenmanlardan sonra daha geç saatlere kadar kalıyordu, ilk başta bana bunun sadece bir turnuvaya hazırlık yaptıkları için olduğunu söyledi ama şimdi turnuva bitmiş olmasına rağmen eve geç geliyor, sorduğumda takımın ekstra yardıma ihtiyacı olduğunu veya yetişmem gereken bazı evrak işleri olduğunu gibi belirsiz bahaneler uyduruyor

işte beni gerçekten altüst eden şey geçen hafta işten erken eve geldim, antrenmanda olması gerektiği için evin bana ait olacağını düşünüyordum ama içeri girdiğimde onu kanepede oturmuş, yüzünde kocaman bir gülümsemeyle birine mesaj atarken buldum beni görünce hemen telefonunu kilitledi ve aşırı telaşlandı sadece ebeveynlerden birinin oyun programı hakkında soru sorduğunu söyledi ama doğru gelmedi

elimde sağlam bir kanıt yok ama bir şeyler ters gidiyor neden bu çocuğun görünüşünden bahsediyor neden aniden bu kadar gizemli oldu daha fazla bir şey olduğu hissini üzerimden atamadım

onu gerçek bir kanıt olmadan bu kadar ciddi bir şeyle suçlamak istemiyorum ama içgüdülerimi de görmezden gelmek istemiyorum onu ​​seviyorum ve özellikle akıl hocalığı yapması gereken bir çocukla böyle bir şey yapmasına gerçekten inanmak istemiyorum

reddit ne yapmalıyım bunu fazla mı abartıyorum beni bir yaşındaki bir çocukla mı aldatıyor yoksa sadece paranoyak mı davranıyorum böyle bir şey hakkında onunla nasıl yüzleşmeye başlayabilirim

herhangi bir tavsiye takdir edilir dürüst olmak gerekirse şu anda kendimi kaybolmuş hissediyorum

güncellemeler

herkese merhaba

öncelikle orijinalimdeki yorum, tavsiye ve desteğin ezici miktarı için hepinize teşekkür etmek istiyorum post gerçekten biraz sağduyuya ihtiyacım vardı ve topluluğun girdisini gerçekten takdir ediyorum, bu kafa karıştırıcı zamanda çok şey ifade etti

yorumlarınızı okuduktan sonra tavsiyelerinizden bazılarını aldım ve orijinal gönderimin akşamı avukatımla iletişime geçtim, yakında bununla ilgili daha fazla ayrıntıya gireceğim ancak güncellemelere dalmadan önce bu gönderinin neden şimdi ve bu formatta yayınlandığını açıklamak istiyorum

ne yazık ki orijinal gönderimi yayınladıktan sonra kaldırıldı ve subreddit'ten üç günlük bir yasak aldım, şükürler olsun ki gönderi daha sonra geri yüklendi ancak güncellemeleri paylaşmak için yasağın kalkmasını beklemek zorunda kaldım, her gelişmeyi takip ettim ve gerçekleştikçe yazdım, bu yüzden en başından beri planladığım gibi kronolojik sırayla paylaşacağım

güncellemeleri yeni bir gönderide yayınlıyorum çünkü söylenecek çok şey var ve bence tüm güncellemeleri net bir şekilde düzenlemek için yeni bir gönderi oluşturmak en iyisi güncelleme gönderisinde orijinal gönderiye bir bağlantı eklenecek, belki de görmemiş olanlar için"
"i don’t drink, i simply don’t enjoy the taste of alcohol, however my girlfriend drinks every now and then, and every time she does, she gets super wasted and it becomes rather an.. interesting night. this time, we had stayed in, and she drank whilst i played video games beside her, i wasn’t too focused on her, she kept on babbling on, but then she said something that caught my attention so quick, i immediately turned off my PC and faced her and asked her more about what she had just said.

she simply admitted to cheating on all SEVEN of her boyfriends, and the cherry on top? they never knew, she was almost.. braggy about it in a way, prideful, and egotistical. i was taken aback, and shocked to my core (we’ve been dating for 3 years, she NEVER mentioned cheating on any of her ex’s, much less all SEVEN of them)

i held my emotions, and kept myself in check. told her i was gonna go to bed, and after i woke up in the morning, i found her in the kitchen making us both breakfast. she seemed completely sober and relaxed.

part of me was hesitant to bring up her confession, but i did, and once i asked her, her expression changed, her eyes widened, and she started stuttering, she then admitted to everything being true, and began crying, talking about how she wasn’t proud of what she had done and how she cheated on all of her partners.

i told her i needed space and left, it’s been 2 days since i’ve spoken to her, my mind is scattered and my heart feels.. heavy.

her cheating on her partners, and bragging about how she got away with it has me feeling violently sick, and now i’m stuck in my own paranoia

i keep asking myself, what if she cheated on me? what if im next? what if she played me too?

she keeps blowing up my phone, but i’ve been decking her.

any advice, please? i was just as recently as a month ago talking with my mother about turning her into my wife and taking that next step, and now i don’t even know if i want to be in a relationship with her.





IMPORTANT UPDATE: i just recently asked her to come over so we can talk about what happened, and i told her if she wasn’t going to be FULLY truthful about her past, and our relationship, then her and i are permanently done and over with.

and so… she exposed everything, and i mean everything.

i left out a lot of details, so im sorry about that, so let me make myself a lot more clear—

her and i are both in our early 30’s. she told me she cheated on all her boyfriends 10 years ago during her college years when she was younger, more reckless, and more selfish with her choices.

she also mentioned, when her and i got together, it had been years since her previous relationship, and that she went to therapy and did a lot of self reflection.

she also admitted to me that during the start of our relationship, she had been texting a few other guys, but DID NOT cheat on me, and once she realized she was falling deeply in love with me, cut them all off, and focused on our relationship.

i was hurting to core hearing all the words spill out of her mouth. although it’s been 10 years since her physically cheating on all of her past relationships doesn’t mean im safe with her, clearly i wasn’t when she was SO CLOSE to emotionally cheating on me in the start of her relationship, and even though she admitted to cutting them off, in that moment, i lost almost all my respect for her.

respectfully, i told her that i was done, and that i loved her, but i don’t love her enough to sit and wonder and have these thoughts chase me now every time i am with her now that i know the truth.

broke up with her right then and there, i didn’t allow myself to feel guilty for her, she simply was not the woman i thought i knew, it all feels like a facade and although it is tearing me apart, i respect myself way too much to be tied to someone who’ll have me questioning.

“is she cheating on me?”

“is she lying?”

“what if she does cheat?”

i’m 34, im way too old to be dealing with someone who’ll raise my blood pressure like that.

i rather deal with the heartbreak of our relationship ending then forgive her and have her possibly disrespect our relationship.

THANK YOU TO EVERYONE’S COMMENTS, TRULY, IT IS BECAUSE OF YOU, I CHOSE MYSELF FIRST. 🙏","ben içki içmem, alkolün tadını sevmiyorum ancak kız arkadaşım ara sıra içer ve her içtiğinde aşırı sarhoş olur ve bu gece oldukça ilginç bir hal alır bu sefer evde kalmıştık ve ben onun yanında video oyunları oynarken o içti, ona fazla odaklanmamıştım, gevezelik etmeye devam etti ama sonra dikkatimi çeken bir şey söyledi, hemen bilgisayarımı kapattım ve ona dönüp az önce söyledikleri hakkında daha fazla soru sordum

sadece yedi erkek arkadaşını aldattığını itiraf etti ve üstüne üstlük bunu hiç anlamadılar, gururlu ve egoist bir şekilde neredeyse övünüyordu, şaşkına döndüm ve tüm benliğimle şok oldum, yıllardır sevgiliyiz, eski sevgililerinden hiçbirini aldattığından hiç bahsetmedi, yedisinden bahsetmiyorum bile

duygularımı kontrol ettim ve kendimi kontrol ettim, ona yatağa gideceğimi söyledim ve sabah uyandığımda onu mutfakta ikimize de kahvaltı hazırlarken buldum, tamamen ayık ve rahat görünüyordu

bir parçam itirafını gündeme getirmekte tereddüt ediyordu ama getirdim ve ona sorduğumda ifadesi değişti, gözleri kocaman açıldı ve kekelemeye başladı sonra her şeyin doğru olduğunu itiraf etti ve ağlamaya başladı, yaptıklarından gurur duymadığını ve tüm partnerlerini nasıl aldattığını anlattı

ona biraz alana ihtiyacım olduğunu söyledim ve gittim onunla konuşalı günler oldu aklım dağıldı ve kalbim ağırlaştı

partnerlerini aldatması ve bununla nasıl kurtulduğunu övünmesi beni çok hasta ediyor ve şimdi kendi paranoyamda sıkıştım

kendime sürekli soruyorum ya beni aldatırsa ya bir sonraki ben olursam ya da benimle oynarsa

telefonumu patlatmaya devam ediyor ama ben onu kandırıyorum

lütfen bir tavsiye verin daha bir ay önce annemle onu karım yapmak ve bir sonraki adımı atmak hakkında konuşuyordum ve şimdi onunla bir ilişki yaşamak isteyip istemediğimi bile bilmiyorum

önemli güncelleme az önce gelip olanları konuşmamızı istedim ve ona geçmişi ve ilişkimiz hakkında tam olarak dürüst olmayacaksa o zaman onunla ilişkimizin kalıcı olarak bittiğini söyledim

ve böylece her şeyi ifşa etti ve demek istediğim her şey

birçok ayrıntıyı atladım bu yüzden özür dilerim bu yüzden kendimi daha açık ifade edeyim

o ve ben ikimiz de erken s'liyiz bana üniversite yıllarında gençken tüm erkek arkadaşlarını aldattığını söyledi daha pervasız ve seçimleriyle daha bencil

ayrıca o ve ben bir araya geldiğimizde önceki ilişkisinin üzerinden yıllar geçtiğini ve terapiye gittiğini ve çok fazla öz değerlendirme yaptığını söyledi

ayrıca ilişkimizin başlangıcında birkaç başka adamla mesajlaştığını ama beni aldatmadığını ve bana aşık olduğunu anladığında hepsini kesip ilişkimize odaklandığını itiraf etti

ağzından dökülen tüm kelimeleri duyduğumda içim parçalandı her ne kadar fiziksel olarak tüm geçmiş ilişkilerini aldattığı yıllar geçmiş olsa da onunla güvende olduğum anlamına gelmiyor açıkçası ben de değildim ilişkisinin başında beni duygusal olarak aldatmaya bu kadar yaklaştığında ve o anda onları kestiğini itiraf etmesine rağmen ona olan saygımın neredeyse tamamını kaybettim

saygıyla ona bittiğimi ve onu sevdim ama onu oturup merak edecek ve şimdi her onunla olduğumda bu düşüncelerin peşimi bırakmasını sağlayacak kadar sevmiyorum, artık gerçeği biliyorum

o an ve orada ayrıldım, kendimi onun için suçlu hissetmeme izin vermedim, o benim tanıdığımı sandığım kadın değildi, her şey bir aldatmaca gibi geliyor ve beni parçalasa da kendime, beni sorgulatacak birine bağlanacak kadar saygım yok

beni aldatıyor mu

yalan mı söylüyor

ya aldatırsa

tansiyonumu böyle yükseltecek biriyle uğraşmak için çok yaşlıyım

ilişkimizin bitmesiyle yaşadığım kalp kırıklığıyla uğraşmayı, onu affetmeyi ve ilişkimize saygısızlık etmesini tercih ederim

herkesin yorumları için teşekkür ederim, gerçekten sizin sayenizde önce kendimi seçtim"
"To make a very long story short, my husband was accused of sexual assault 5 years ago by his cousin. She stated the incident happened when he was 14 and she was 8 and he touched her private area on an occasion during a family event when others were looking away.  He vehemently denied this at the time and his immediate family stood behind him. I met him 2 years after the accusation, and I learned of this accusation during our relationship and decided that I would believe that he was telling the truth based on the man he presented himself to me - extremely caring, giving and respectful. 

We have been married for a month.  Yesterday, we heard from my husband's ex wife that his son touched another boy inappropriately during karate class. I felt sick to my stomach for this little boy and my mind was racing on how this wonderful little boy could do such a thing to someone else. After a very long, emotional and difficult discussion about sexual assault, boundaries etc,  my husband wound up admitting that he did touch his cousin inappropriately all of those years ago and was too ""ashamed"" to admit it when he was accused. 

I haven't been able to look at him since yesterday and regardless of the love I have/had for him, I can't imagine how a person who could do this to a child and then also lie about it for years can be in a position to be a father and raise kids.  I would like to think that we can solve this through therapy but I think I am too sick over it and feel like I'm just as disgusting as he is for staying by his side and believing the lie.  Has anyone been through this before?  I will be talking to a divorce lawyer and I have a therapy appointment scheduled for tomorrow to help guide me on what to do next. Not sure what I'm looking for here but a month after tying the knot I feel so lost, disconnected and depressed.  




**************************
EDIT: I am reading through the responses and while many of them are hard to read, I appreciate the many different perspectives here.  

For those that say I deserve this, I understand, and there is more context. I questioned him multiple times over this accusation and every time he repeated that he did not do it. In my heart, I never believed he did absolutely nothing wrong, and told him that. I did not have enough information and he repeated that he had no recollection of this happening, and sometimes denying it directly. Again, some of you who have experienced sexual abuse in your family have mentioned Im a vile human being for believing him over her, and I truly understand. I am upset at myself for not pushing back for more information at these key checkpoints of our relationship and I fucked up. 

For those who ask for more context surrounding the accusation: it was 5 years ago and prior to my meeting him. 3 of my husband's aunts called each one of my husband's 4 siblings, told them he touched his cousin, and asked if they were with them or against them. The ultimatum was that if they decided to keep contact with my husband, they would be cutoff from them.  One sibling asked for more information and was hung up on, then decided he could not cut my husband off with the lack of context.  My husband's sister did cut contact with him for 2 years after this phone call.  Two of the aunts have asked my husband to reconcile with their families, to which he said he was unable to at the time. My husband's sister resumed contact with him around the time I met him. 

Further context: my husband's mother was in jail for most of his teenage years for drug trafficking. His father was deported when he was 8. He was molested by his father's sister multiple times around the age of 7/8 and was forced to arouse her sexually of which likely confused the shit out of him and fucked him up mentally.  He was raised by the aunts on the mother's side. When he was 16, his aunts and uncles decided to ""order"" a prostitute for him because they kept catching him with porn magazines, and forced him to have sex with her to rid him of his obsession"". He was a virgin at the time and said he was terrified of this woman.  When she left, he said one of his uncles had sex with her in another room with permission from his wife. This is one of his most traumatic experiences other than being molested as a kid.  He has been in therapy for 5 years, and has talked about these experiences in therapy only recently, and at my urging. He did not bring up to his therapist that he did touch his cousin and that's certainly where the fuck up is. 

For those who asked for more context around my husband's son: he is 9 years old and lives primarily with my husband's ex wife and his grandfather.  My husband flies down to Florida several times a year to see him, and it is typically alongside his ex-wife, until I came into the picture.  He does not have ""supervised visitation"", but he could not afford to rent a car for every visit and would stay at his father in laws house in order to see his son.  Regarding the touching at karate - My husband and his ex wife asked his son on a joint phone call if anyone touched him in his private area and he said they did not. My husband pushed his ex wife to place his son in therapy, which she did not want to do at first, as well as get sessions with the guidance counselor at his school weekly.  I don't know what I believe now, and it's possible that my husband touched him given the information I now know, but I don't think I can fairly make that connection yet.  

EDIT AGAIN: My husband will be meeting with his psychologist this week at her soonest appointment, and confessing what he did to his family. He is meeting with the Dr. first to first apologize for lying to her as well, and get guidance on how to do this without traumatizing everyone further. 

I'm just going to clarify this - I am not trying to be an apologist for my husband here.  He was 100% wrong and his actions towards his cousin are reprehensible. But since there are several people in the comments who have mentioned there was a lack of context, I am providing that.  I still have plans to speak with a divorce lawyer and therapist this week to speak through this and weigh my options being that this marriage is so new.

tekrar düzenle kocam bu hafta psikoloğuyla en yakın randevusunda görüşecek ve ailesine yaptıklarını itiraf edecek, önce doktorla görüşecek, önce ona yalan söylediği için özür dileyecek ve bunu daha fazla travmatize etmeden nasıl yapacağına dair rehberlik alacak

sadece bunu açıklığa kavuşturacağım, kocam için özür dilemeye çalışmıyorum, burada yanılıyordu ve kuzenine karşı davranışları kınanacak nitelikte ama yorumlarda bağlam eksikliğinden bahseden birkaç kişi olduğu için hala bu hafta boşanma avukatı ve terapistle görüşmeyi ve bu evliliğin çok yeni olması nedeniyle seçeneklerimi değerlendirmeyi planlıyorum"

**Summary of situation:**

In my first post, I shared that I had been increasingly concerned about my wife’s fixation on a 17-year-old boy she coaches. Over the past months, she’s brought him up constantly, talking about his potential and struggles almost daily. At first, I assumed it was part of her dedication to her volunteer work, but her focus on him seemed to cross professional boundaries, especially as she became defensive and secretive when I asked about it. Many suggested I look deeper, and after further observation, I noticed she was glued to her phone at odd hours, sometimes smiling or acting distant.

**Thanks to comments**

Thank you to everyone who reached out in my previous posts. Your advice and support have helped me more than I can express. I took a lot of your suggestions to heart, and it’s been a complicated journey. Here’s what’s happened since then.

**Post update 3:**

I did what many people suggested and contacted our local police. Although this would be the preferred option, our current financial positional and my current salary doesn’t allow me to hire a private investigator. She is also the main earner in the relationship (about 60% of our shared income). Not only can I not afford to hire a PI but there is also the issue that we have a shared bank account. Any purchases. I am aware that its always smart to have our own individual bank accounts alongside a shared one, but we have been so close as trusting with each other that we haven’t really seen the need for this and having a joint account has never really been an issue. As her job is an accountant, she is mainly in charge of managing our banking and any large purchases have to go through both of us, just by the way the account is set up. This means it would be practically impossible to hire a private investigator without her finding out.

After our last conversation she has moved back after staying with her friend and we are living in the same home. It is very awkward, and I have been trying to avoid her wherever possible whilst doing my best not to let on that I am trying to dig further.

It was about a day after my last post that I decided to contact the police and after a pretty long conversation explaining the situation, they told me that there was no legal grounds for them take action without any concrete evidence or clear signs of suspicious activity. They advised me to keep an eye out and call them immediately if anything new came up. I appreciated their time, but honestly, their advice didn’t give me a clear path forward.

**Post update 4:**

So, there has been a major development to the situation. I am feeling a load of complicated emotions right now and writing this has been very tricky.  
Since the police couldn’t help, I took advice from many of you and contacted our shared mobile provider. After some back and fourth, they sent over out call and SMS records from the past six months. These records only cover standard messages and calls.

I spent hours combing through these records, trying to find anything unusual, and eventually found what I was looking for: a lot of messages and calls with a specific unknown number. After digging into it, I realized that this number wasn’t the kids. It belonged to his dad.

Suddenly, things clicked, and at the same time, I was thrown into a whirlwind of emotions - grief, anger, disbelief. In a weird way I was also somewhat relieved.  
I don’t know for sure but what I think has been going on this entire time is my wife has been having an affair with this kids’ dad, hence her recent obsession. Knowing full well that she couldn’t openly talk about her relationship with this dad, it appears she has been using his son as an outlet to talk about him in our daily lives without arising too much suspicion. In some strange way, I even feel a hint of relief; if I’m right, at least she wasn’t involved with a minor. This still feels like a betrayal, but one that’s more bearable than the alternative. Looking through the messages, I can now see that she is obsessed with this man, and it looks like they are in love. I am distraught that this has been going on now for so long and that the person who I have trusted and confided in for so long has been lying to me this entire time. I cannot really put the way I am feeling into words.

I can’t be certain that nothing inappropriate happened between her and the kid, but this explanation now feels more plausible to me. Still, I feel like I’m mourning the person I thought I knew and loved. The woman I’ve been with for six years, whom I trusted completely, has been hiding this from me, and it’s crushing.

**Post update 5:**

I honestly don’t see any way of working through this, so I have contacted a divorce attorney and am filing for a divorce. She isn’t aware yet, as my lawyer and I are just making everything final before serving her with the papers. I am also looking for a new apartment that I can move into when this becomes more final. My father passed away ten years ago from lung cancer, and my mum just passed away pretty recently during lockdown. I have one brother who lives on the other side of the globe and have very little contact with him nowadays. I haven’t seen him since my mum’s funeral, and my wife has really been the only person who has been alongside me through these tricky last few years.

She has family; both her parents are still alive, and she is very close to her sister. I have no idea if any of them know anything about what’s going on, but I know she tells her sister everything. Also, most of my friends are also friends of hers, or in a relationship to one of her friends as I was new to the area when we met and didn't know many people. I don't really want to put them in the situation of having to pick sides but also could really do with a close friend to express my feelings to.

As far as the kid and his dad, I still don’t actually know who they are. I don’t tend to get involved with her work, like volunteering. I have never met anyone on the team she coaches or any of their parents. So, I obviously don’t know anything about this guy. In none of the messages was there any mention of a wife or girlfriend, only the name of his son. At this stage, I don’t think it’s my responsibility to try and inform the family of the guy she’s been seeing, as I literally don’t even know who he is.

I don’t plan on confronting her about everything I have found out but will definitely answer any questions if she asks why I’m so suddenly asking for a divorce\*\*.\*\*

I would really like to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences and what would be the best way to move forward? What's the best way to go about a tricky divorce without anyone close to me to ask for guidance and support?

summary of situation

in my first post i shared that i had been increasingly concerned about my wifes fixation on a yearold boy she coaches over the past months shes brought him up constantly talking about his potential and struggles almost daily at first i assumed it was part of her dedication to her volunteer work but her focus on him seemed to cross professional boundaries especially as she became defensive and secretive when i asked about it many suggested i look deeper and after further observation i noticed she was glued to her phone at odd hours sometimes smiling or acting distant

thanks to comments

thank you to everyone who reached out in my previous posts your advice and support have helped me more than i can express i took a lot of your suggestions to heart and its been a complicated journey heres whats happened since then

post update 

i did what many people suggested and contacted our local police although this would be the preferred option our current financial positional and my current salary doesnt allow me to hire a private investigator she is also the main earner in the relationship about  of our shared income not only can i not afford to hire a pi but there is also the issue that we have a shared bank account any purchases i am aware that its always smart to have our own individual bank accounts alongside a shared one but we have been so close as trusting with each other that we havent really seen the need for this and having a joint account has never really been an issue as her job is an accountant she is mainly in charge of managing our banking and any large purchases have to go through both of us just by the way the account is set up this means it would be practically impossible to hire a private investigator without her finding out

after our last conversation she has moved back after staying with her friend and we are living in the same home it is very awkward and i have been trying to avoid her wherever possible whilst doing my best not to let on that i am trying to dig further

it was about a day after my last post that i decided to contact the police and after a pretty long conversation explaining the situation they told me that there was no legal grounds for them take action without any concrete evidence or clear signs of suspicious activity they advised me to keep an eye out and call them immediately if anything new came up i appreciated their time but honestly their advice didnt give me a clear path forward

post update 

so there has been a major development to the situation i am feeling a load of complicated emotions right now and writing this has been very tricky  
since the police couldnt help i took advice from many of you and contacted our shared mobile provider after some back and fourth they sent over out call and sms records from the past six months these records only cover standard messages and calls

i spent hours combing through these records trying to find anything unusual and eventually found what i was looking for a lot of messages and calls with a specific unknown number after digging into it i realized that this number wasnt the kids it belonged to his dad

suddenly things clicked and at the same time i was thrown into a whirlwind of emotions  grief anger disbelief in a weird way i was also somewhat relieved  
i dont know for sure but what i think has been going on this entire time is my wife has been having an affair with this kids dad hence her recent obsession knowing full well that she couldnt openly talk about her relationship with this dad it appears she has been using his son as an outlet to talk about him in our daily lives without arising too much suspicion in some strange way i even feel a hint of relief if im right at least she wasnt involved with a minor this still feels like a betrayal but one thats more bearable than the alternative looking through the messages i can now see that she is obsessed with this man and it looks like they are in love i am distraught thabu çok uzun zamandır devam ediyor ve uzun zamandır güvendiğim ve sırdaşlık ettiğim kişi bana yalan söylüyordu, hissettiklerimi kelimelerle ifade edemiyorum

onunla çocuk arasında uygunsuz bir şey olmadığından emin olamıyorum ama bu açıklama şimdi bana daha makul geliyor, yine de tanıdığımı ve sevdiğimi düşündüğüm kişinin yasını tutuyormuşum gibi hissediyorum, altı yıldır birlikte olduğum kadına tamamen güvendim, bunu benden saklıyor ve bu çok yıkıcı

güncelleme sonrası

dürüst olmak gerekirse bunun üstesinden gelmenin bir yolunu göremiyorum, bu yüzden bir boşanma avukatıyla iletişime geçtim ve boşanma davası açıyorum, henüz kendisi farkında değil, avukatım ve ben ona evrakları tebliğ etmeden önce her şeyi kesinleştiriyoruz, ayrıca bu daha kesin hale geldiğinde taşınabileceğim yeni bir daire arıyorum babam on yıl önce akciğer kanserinden vefat etti ve annem de karantina sırasında yakın zamanda vefat etti, dünyanın diğer ucunda yaşayan bir erkek kardeşim var ve onunla artık çok az iletişim kuruyorum, annemin cenazesinden beri onu görmedim ve karım gerçekten bu zorlu son birkaç yılda yanımda olan tek kişi oydu

ailesi var, her iki ebeveyni de hala hayatta ve kız kardeşine çok yakın, onlardan herhangi birinin neler olup bittiği hakkında bir şey bilip bilmediğini bilmiyorum ama kız kardeşine her şeyi anlattığını biliyorum ayrıca arkadaşlarımın çoğu da onun arkadaşı veya arkadaşlarından biriyle ilişkisi var çünkü tanıştığımızda bölgeye yeni gelmiştim ve pek fazla insan tanımıyordum onları taraf seçmek zorunda bırakmak istemiyorum ama duygularımı ifade edebileceğim yakın bir arkadaşım da olmalı

çocuk ve babasına gelince, kim olduklarını hala bilmiyorum, gönüllülük gibi işlerine karışma eğiliminde değilim, koçluk yaptığı takımda veya ebeveynlerinden herhangi biriyle hiç tanışmadım, bu yüzden mesajların hiçbirinde bu adam hakkında hiçbir şey bilmiyorum, bir eş veya kız arkadaştan bahsedildi mi, sadece oğlunun adı geçti, bu aşamada ailesine görüştüğü adamın kim olduğunu bildirmeye çalışmanın benim sorumluluğum olduğunu düşünmüyorum çünkü kelimenin tam anlamıyla kim olduğunu bile bilmiyorum

öğrendiğim her şey hakkında onunla yüzleşmeyi planlamıyorum ama Eğer neden aniden boşanmak istediğimi sorarsa kesinlikle her soruyu yanıtlayacağım

Başka birinin de benzer deneyimler yaşayıp yaşamadığını ve ilerlemenin en iyi yolunun ne olduğunu, rehberlik ve destek isteyebileceğim yakınımda kimse olmadan zorlu bir boşanmayla başa çıkmanın en iyi yolunun ne olduğunu gerçekten duymak isterim

Okuduğunuz için teşekkür ederim ve bir sonraki adımları belirlerken herkesi güncel tutacağım, daha fazla tavsiyeniz varsa çok sevinirim"
"So, a little backstory: I’ve been with my boyfriend (both 28) for almost two years. Over the last two years, my boyfriend has tended to get really upset over really small things. For example, 
1. Once I got undressed too close to a window on vacation (we were on the top floor of a hotel) and he screamed at me and accused me of wanting other people to see me naked. 
2. One time we were in a different hotel and I guess I said something too loud, and he physically covered my mouth with his hand and had the other hand behind my head which left me unable to speak. 
3. About two months into us dating, we went on a dinner date and had agreed to watch a movie at his house after. I accidentally dozed off on the couch and he got really upset about it. 

Anyway, tonight, I cooked us dinner and he was kinda helping me clean up my kitchen (we do not live together). I asked if he would take the trash out while I finished cleaning, and he said he didn’t feel like it. I ended up taking it out and when I came back inside, I began giving him a hard time, saying “are you actually a man bc I just took the trash out”. This made him really mad and he pushed me hard with both hands. I didn’t fall or anything, but I did stumble backwards. I told him I wanted him to leave my house and he responded that he wouldn’t. I said it at least 3 more times, and then he finally did leave. He texted me “sorry for pushing you” after he left, but I didn’t respond. I think this might be my breaking point. I know this isn’t normal. 

Edit: I really appreciate how supportive everyone in the comments has been. I fully understand that I shouldn’t have said what I did about him “being a man” last night, and I take full responsibility for that. However, I don’t think it was necessary for him to push me in response. I’ve been making excuses for his behavior for way too long and this is my breaking point. The last thing I want is to have children with this man and this be the relationship they grow up seeing. ","küçük bir geçmiş hikayesi erkek arkadaşımla neredeyse iki yıldır birlikteyiz son iki yıldır erkek arkadaşım çok küçük şeyler yüzünden çok üzülme eğilimindeydi örneğin 
bir keresinde tatilde pencereye çok yakın soyunmuştum bir otelin en üst katındaydık ve bana bağırdı ve beni başkalarının beni çıplak görmesini istediğimle suçladı 
bir keresinde farklı bir otelde kalmıştık ve sanırım çok yüksek sesle bir şey söyledim ve fiziksel olarak eliyle ağzımı kapattı ve diğer elini başımın arkasına koydu bu da konuşamamı sağladı 
çıkmaya başlayalı yaklaşık iki ay olmuştu akşam yemeğine çıktık ve yanlışlıkla kanepede uyuyakaldığımda evinde bir film izlemeyi kabul etmiştik ve bu onu çok üzdü 

neyse bu gece yemeğimizi pişirdim ve mutfağımı temizlememe yardım ediyordu birlikte yaşamıyorduk temizliği bitirirken çöpleri çıkarıp çıkaramayacağını sordum ve canı istemediğini söyledi sonunda ben de çıkardım ve içeri girdiğimde ona zor anlar yaşatmaya başladım çöpleri yeni çıkardığım için sen aslında erkek misin dedim bu o gerçekten sinirliydi ve beni iki eliyle sertçe itti düşmedim ya da bir şey olmadı ama geriye doğru sendeledim ona evimden gitmesini istediğimi söyledim ve gitmeyeceğini söyledi en azından birkaç kez söyledim ve sonunda gitti bana mesaj attı seni ittiğim için özür dilerim ama cevap vermedim sanırım bu benim kırılma noktam olabilir bunun normal olmadığını biliyorum

düzenleme yorumlardaki herkesin ne kadar destekleyici olduğunu gerçekten takdir ediyorum dün gece onun bir erkek olduğu konusunda söylediklerimi söylememem gerektiğini tamamen anlıyorum ve bunun tüm sorumluluğunu alıyorum ancak bana karşılık olarak beni itmesinin gerekli olduğunu düşünmüyorum çok uzun zamandır davranışları için bahaneler üretiyorum ve bu benim kırılma noktam bu adamla çocuk sahibi olmak ve bunun büyüdüklerinde görecekleri bir ilişki olması istediğim son şey"
"Hello, I'm writing here because I was so surprised by the suggestion that I was left speechless and I don't know what to do. 


Context: As context: I am a 21-year-old girl studying at university. About a year ago, my mother had to have her uterus removed due to medical problems. This made my mother and my stepfather start having problems in their relationship because my stepfather wants to have children and, obviously, my mother can't ""give them to him.""


In the end, a month ago my stepfather left the house over this same issue, so my mother started obsessing over finding ways to have children. He even wanted to adopt, but my stepfather said that since it wasn't his, he wouldn't come to love it. Until he got to the topic of surrogacy.


She started researching the topic and saw that it was extremely expensive (in dollars, it would be around 30,000), so who was her cheap option? Yo.


On the same day (10/22/24), he asked me to be his surrogate. Because supposedly I am their only support network and because I wouldn't charge them anything. But when he told me, I felt an overwhelming urge to vomit and cry. She started saying that she wouldn't force me, but a moment later she talked about how beautiful pregnancy was and that she would talk to my university to get their support. 


I clearly don't want to have children at this age. Yes, I'm no longer a teenager, but I'm still young and I don't want to ruin my life explaining why I'm pregnant. In addition to this, I take psychiatric medications and an unwanted pregnancy would, in short, make me commit suicide. 


So my only options (considering my mother's personality) are: accept and live in depression or get kicked out of the house and not be able to study anymore.


What should I do? I'm really very desperate.

Edit: So, I was talking to my psychologist and, most of all, to my psychiatrist. They gave me several techniques to reject my mother's proposal. A few days ago I finally managed to tell my mother my opinion. I told her straight out that I don't want to get pregnant now, not in 5 years, not ever. I explained to her that if she were to force me I would resent her for the rest of my life and that (if I did) I would even disown the child. Another issue I talked about was that it would be a violation of my rights and that I really didn't want to get into legal trouble over an issue that could easily be solved by talking. In the end my mother decided to accept my rejection of her idea. Sure, our relationship broke down a lot because of this but at least she won't throw me out of the house (bravo). Although I am still going to job interviews to earn money and very soon I will be leaving home. Thank you all for your support, I really appreciate it. ","merhaba buraya yazıyorum çünkü öneri beni o kadar şaşırttı ki konuşamadım ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum

bağlam olarak bağlam ben üniversitede okuyan bir yaşında bir kızım yaklaşık bir yıl önce annem tıbbi sorunlar nedeniyle rahmini aldırmak zorunda kaldı bu da annemle üvey babamın ilişkilerinde sorunlar yaşamaya başlamasına neden oldu çünkü üvey babam çocuk sahibi olmak istiyor ve annem belli ki çocuklarını ona veremiyor

sonunda bir ay önce üvey babam aynı sorun yüzünden evi terk etti bu yüzden annem çocuk sahibi olmanın yollarını bulmaya kafayı takmaya başladı hatta evlat edinmek istedi ama üvey babam taşıyıcı annelik konusuna gelene kadar bundan hoşlanmayacağını söyledi

konuyu araştırmaya başladı ve dolar olarak aşırı pahalı olduğunu gördü etrafta dolaşıyor peki onun ucuz seçeneği kimdi

aynı gün taşıyıcı anne olmamı istedi çünkü sözde tek destek ağları bendim ve onlardan hiçbir ücret talep etmeyecektim ama bana söylediğinde kusma ve ağlama isteği hissettim beni zorlamayacağını söylemeye başladı ama bir an daha sonra hamileliğin ne kadar güzel olduğunu ve desteklerini almak için üniversitemle konuşacağını söyledi

açıkça bu yaşta çocuk sahibi olmak istemiyorum evet artık genç değilim ama hala gencim ve hamileliğimi neden açıklayarak hayatımı mahvetmek istemiyorum buna ek olarak psikiyatrik ilaçlar alıyorum ve istenmeyen bir hamilelik beni kısaca intihara sürükler

bu yüzden annemin kişiliğini göz önünde bulundurarak tek seçeneğim kabul edip depresyonda yaşamak ya da evden atılıp bir daha ders çalışamamak

ne yapmalıyım gerçekten çok çaresizim

düzenleme bu yüzden psikoloğumla ve en önemlisi psikiyatristim ile konuşuyordum bana annemin teklifini reddetmek için birkaç teknik verdiler birkaç gün önce sonunda anneme fikrimi söylemeyi başardım ona hamile kalmak istemediğimi açıkça söyledim şimdi değil yıllar sonra değil asla ona beni zorlarsa hayatımın geri kalanında ona kızacağımı ve eğer yaparsam çocuğu reddedeceğimi açıkladım bahsettiğim bir diğer konu da bunun haklarımın ihlali olacağı ve gerçekten yasal sorun yaşamak istemediğimdi konuşarak kolayca çözülebilecek bir konu yüzünden annem sonunda fikrini reddetmemi kabul etmeye karar verdi elbette ilişkimiz bundan dolayı çok bozuldu ama en azından beni evden atmayacak bravo yine de para kazanmak için iş görüşmelerine gidiyorum ve çok yakında evden ayrılacağım desteğiniz için hepinize teşekkür ederim gerçekten minnettarım"
"So, in November of 2023, I posted on here that I traveled to South Korea with my friends and stayed there for a month. I met a Korean girl, hooked up with her, and two days before we left, she told me she was pregnant. Most of the comments told me I should go back and get a DNA test. I built up the courage, and on September 3, I booked a flight with my friend. We got there and texted her through Instagram, where she was keeping me updated with the baby, even though I was suspicious. Surprisingly, she wasn't upset with me; she was happy I was there. Anyways, I immediately asked for a DNA test, and it took three days to get the results. I was scared, nervous, and felt sick. Finally, the results came back - it's me, I'm the father. Not gonna lie, my heart dropped, I was sweating, shaking, and on the verge of tears. I came back home after being there for one week. I told her I needed to go home and think for a while. She said, and I quote, ""Ok, but please do what's right for our daughter."" It's been about two weeks since I've been back, and I genuinely don't know what to do. I still like her, but I live in America; it's not like I can just move there. I'm still so naive to so many things. Please give me some advice; I'm stressing.


Update : So, I've been getting a few DMs saying I fetishize Asians. Let me tell you how I even thought about going to South Korea. Around October of 2022, I decided to walk to a Korean restaurant that's four minutes away from my apartment and get some food. I enjoyed the food so much that I would go once or twice a week. Eventually, I grew close to the son, who was 20 at the time, and his mom. They're both Korean American. After being friends with him for a while, he asked if I wanted to take a trip to South Korea. For a while, I thought about it and eventually said yes. And that's how everything went down. I don't fetishize Asians. Korea was the first Asian country I've been to. I had only been to the UK and Mexico before. I'm talking with her, and we're figuring something out. I will let you guys know what will happen.

Update: I want to thank everyone who genuinely gave me advice. After talking with her, we both decided it's best if I go to Korea for a bit and be there for my daughter and build a relationship with her. She’s willing to get me Korean lessons and everything I need to make sure I am the best for my daughter. My family agrees I need to be there for her. I still need to figure out some things with my work, but that will come in time. Also, thank you to everyone who private messaged me. It really woke me up. Wish me luck, and check my page—I posted a picture of me and her. I want y'all to see us. Thank y'all so, so much.😊

"I inherited about 50K $ from my father. My boyfriend knew. About a Year later he asked me for 9,700$ to buy a new car. He said he will return the money within a year. What should I do? I really don’t feel comfortable giving him the money. He’s not my husband. We’ve been going out for 7 years and has no intention of marrying me. But he treats me nicely and always supports me. My inheritance is the only back up I have in life. I have no family left. Anything goes wrong I’ll feel devastated. Please tell me, am I being cheap?

For context I was in a two year relationship with a man much older than me. I was groomed and we started using various substances together. I moved in with him a few months after turning 18 because he was threatening to kill himself if he was left alone. I tried to leave roughly a year into the relationship and got clean for a few months only to move back in when he started seriously threatening to end his life again. Things were very abusive and I was scared to be around him for much of the relationship. After we went through some financial trouble my parents offered to pay his rent if I left so he wouldn't get evicted from his home. I went to rehab two weeks later. 
While I was in rehab I talked to him and tried to convince him to get to NA meetings, threatening to cut contact with him if he wouldn't. The last conversation I had with him was a week and a half before I went home from rehab. We had two sugar gliders and I wanted to get them out of the house because it was an unsafe environment. We got into a minor argument and the last thing I said was that it was a mistake to continue talking to him and the only reason I was was because I wanted my babies back. I said I would be picking them up from him when I got back from rehab and he had a week and a half to get them ready.
When I got out of rehab I found out two days later that he was no longer alive after attempting to contact him to get my pets back. As a result of his death both of the cats he owned and one of the sugar gliders passed away as well. I got the remaining one back from the humane society.
It's been a few months and everything is finally starting to hit and I'm really struggling. I dont know how to handle this.if anyone can offer some advice it would be greatly appreciated.

"My boyfriend 28M and I 29F have been together for about three years. It hasn’t always been rainbows and sunshine. But the good times always did outweigh the bad times. We would get into little disagreements here and there. Two years into our relationship he was struck by a vehicle and landed in the hospital for about five months. He had two shattered legs, broken ribs, broken hand, broken foot, and suffered from a fat embolism which caused some  brain damage(TBI) . I was there for him every step of the way, which obviously isn’t an issue, I definitely am not trying to make myself out to be a martyr or anything but I would go to the hospital and visit him every single day. Working 50+ hours a week and I would i would immediately go to see him after every shift. It was pretty mentally exhausting honestly. But he did eventually get better and he was discharged and able to come home. 

Ever since the accident I literally can’t stand to be around him. He’s so quick to anger and he’s mean a lot of the time. Or he’s flat out neglectful. Of course I didn’t I expect him to go work right away, so for the last year I’ve just been taking care of him, paying all the bills and giving him money to do whatever he wanted with (buy snacks, games, etc) 
I will try to take him on outings on my days off, museums, zoo, nice restaurants, movies etc and he’s on his phone the entire time. He’s always playing Pokemon go. He will not put his phone down. He claims playing the game will help with his brain damage. 

After working long shifts, I expect to come home and chat with my boyfriend and relax with him, but I’m ignored because he’s always on his phone. It makes me sad.

So recently I was diagnosed with Graves’ disease, while I was on a business trip. I landed in the hospital for two days, and he didn’t even call me. At this point he was able to drive and I definitely wasn’t expecting him to drive 4 hours to come see me
In the hospital, but I was expecting him to call me at least. 
I was so incredibly upset, I just needed some comfort. He didn’t seem to understand that he was wrong for not calling me. And he blames everything on brain damage. I completely empathize with him having brain damage and I feel like I’m very understanding of his struggles but I just don’t understand how he has time to drive around, hang out with friends, play Pokemon go all day but not call me? 
Also, he scolds/ yells at me in public. Ex- we were at the pet store trying to find a new leash and collar set for our three year old female boxer, and I saw a cute pink/ floral print one (I am still the only working so I’m providing for him and paying for everything)  and he yelled at me how he isn’t going to walk around with a pink leash, and it’s HIS DOG, he bought her, so what he says goes. I was absolutely mortified when he started yelling at me. I am not terribly sensitive but embarrassment is hard for me to handle so I started to tear up a bit and I asked him if I could have a second to myself. He had no self awareness to realize that he was wrong, he thought I was being unreasonable. 
He will also call me out of my name and curse at me. 

He will also do extremely embarrassing things like scream at the self check when there’s an error on the screen. It’s extremely hateful and intolerant of anything that he isn’t familiar with. 

I’ve tried to reason with him and talk things out but he’s resistant to change. I have gained a lot of self awareness throughout the years and I’m huge on “treat others how you want to be treated”, so I’m extremely careful with my tone, and I’m always making sure to not raise my voice, curse during tense moments, and I especially do not believe in calling my boyfriend out of his name, but he can’t even attempt to give me the same respect. He refuses to go to therapy. He even admitted to being a sociopath, which is extremely alarming.

He also spends my money however he likes. 
I was trying to pay our electric bill but for some reason the app wasn’t working on my phone, so I sent him money  specifically to pay for it, and he used the money for something else (he hasn’t told me what he used the $230 for, still to this day). 

I love him a lot and I care about him a lot but also despise him. I find it hard to look at him sometimes. 

There are still some good times sprinkled in, but now the bad definitely outweighs the good. 

He still isn’t working and I feel bad for him, if I leave then he won’t have money to pay the bills. Also I love beautiful dog with all my being. Yes, he technically bought her, but I came into her life when she was six months old and I’ve been caring her ever since. I home make her food every week, but her toys, treats, take her on walks, take her to the vet etc she’s my heart and soul, my pride and joy, I honestly feel like I couldn’t be happy without her. She’s an amazing companion and she loves me so much, she’s always stuck to me hip. But I know if I leave, he wouldn’t let me take her.

- I am seeking help from a therapist.

Not sure how I should proceed. I’m so torn. Pretty sad 

Note- he is 28M, I am 29F","erkek arkadaşım ve ben yaklaşık üç yıldır birlikteyiz her zaman gökkuşağı ve güneş ışığı olmadı ama iyi zamanlar her zaman kötü zamanlardan daha ağır bastı ilişkimizin iki yılında burada ve orada küçük anlaşmazlıklar yaşadık bir araç çarptı ve yaklaşık beş ay hastanede yattı iki bacağı kırıldı kaburgaları kırıldı eli kırıldı ayağı kırıldı ve beyin hasarına neden olan yağ embolisi geçirdi her adımda yanındaydım ki bu kesinlikle bir sorun değil kendimi şehit gibi göstermeye çalışmıyorum ama hastaneye gidip onu her gün ziyaret ederdim haftada 1 saat çalışırdım ve her vardiyadan sonra hemen onu görmeye giderdim dürüst olmak gerekirse oldukça zihinsel olarak yorucuydu ama sonunda iyileşti ve taburcu edildi ve eve gelebildi

kazadan beri onun yanında olmaya dayanamıyorum çok çabuk sinirleniyor ve çoğu zaman kötü davranıyor ya da tamamen ihmalkar tabii ki beklemiyordum hemen işe gitmesini bekliyordum bu yüzden son bir yıldır sadece onunla ilgileniyordum tüm faturaları ödemek ve istediği her şeyi yapması için ona para vermek, atıştırmalıklar, oyunlar vb.
izin günlerimde onu gezilere götürmeye çalışacağım müzeler, hayvanat bahçeleri, güzel restoranlar, filmler vb. ve o sürekli telefonuyla meşgul, sürekli pokemon go oynuyor, telefonunu bırakmıyor, oyun oynamanın beyin hasarına iyi geleceğini iddia ediyor

uzun vardiyalarda çalıştıktan sonra eve gelip erkek arkadaşımla sohbet etmeyi ve onunla rahatlamayı bekliyorum ama sürekli telefonuyla meşgul olduğu için görmezden geliniyorum, bu beni üzüyor

son zamanlarda bir iş seyahatindeyken Graves hastalığı teşhisi kondu, iki gün hastanede yattım ve o beni bu noktada aramadı bile, araba kullanabiliyordu ve kesinlikle beni görmek için saatlerce araba kullanmasını beklemiyordum
hastanedeydim ama en azından beni aramasını bekliyordum
çok inanılmaz üzgündüm, sadece biraz teselliye ihtiyacım vardı, beni aramadığı için yanlış yaptığını anlamamış gibiydi ve her şeyi beyin hasarına bağlıyor, beyin hasarı yaşadığını tamamen anlıyorum ve mücadelelerini çok iyi anladığımı düşünüyorum ama nasıl olduğunu anlamıyorum etrafta dolaşmak, arkadaşlarla takılmak, bütün gün pokemon go oynamak için vakti var ama beni aramıyor
ayrıca beni azarlıyor, bağırıyor, eskiden üç yaşındaki dişi boksörümüz için yeni bir tasma ve tasma seti bulmaya çalışıyorduk ve sevimli pembe çiçek desenli bir tane gördüm, hala çalışan tek kişi ben olduğum için ona bakıyorum ve her şeyin parasını ben ödüyorum ve bana pembe tasmayla dolaşamayacağını ve onun köpeği olduğunu, onu kendisinin satın aldığını söyleyerek bağırdı, bu yüzden ne derse o olur, bana bağırmaya başladığında çok utandım, çok hassas değilim ama utançla başa çıkmak benim için zor, bu yüzden biraz ağlamaya başladım ve ona kendimle baş başa kalmak için bir saniye izin isteyip isteyemeyeceğimi sordum, yanıldığını fark edecek kadar öz farkındalığı yoktu, mantıksız davrandığımı düşünüyordu
ayrıca beni adımla çağırıp küfür edecek

ayrıca ekranda bir hata olduğunda kendini kontrol etmeye bağırmak gibi son derece utanç verici şeyler yapacak, son derece nefret dolu ve yaptığı her şeye karşı hoşgörüsüz

Onunla akıl yürütmeye ve konuşmaya çalıştım ama değişime karşı dirençli Yıllar içinde çok fazla öz farkındalık kazandım ve başkalarına nasıl davranılmasını istiyorsan öyle davranma konusunda çok dikkatliyim, bu yüzden tonum konusunda son derece dikkatliyim ve gergin anlarda sesimi yükseltmemeye her zaman dikkat ediyorum ve özellikle erkek arkadaşımı ismiyle çağırmaya inanmıyorum ama bana aynı saygıyı göstermeye bile çalışmıyor, terapiye gitmeyi reddediyor, hatta sosyopat olduğunu itiraf etti, bu son derece endişe verici

Ayrıca paramı istediği gibi harcıyor
Elektrik faturamızı ödemeye çalışıyordum ama nedense uygulama telefonumda çalışmıyordu, bu yüzden ona özellikle ödemesi için para gönderdim ve parayı başka bir şey için kullandı, bana ne için kullandığını söylemedi, hala

Onu çok seviyorum ve ona çok değer veriyorum ama aynı zamanda ondan nefret ediyorum, bazen ona bakmakta zorlanıyorum

Hâlâ arada serpiştirilmiş iyi zamanlar var ama şimdi kötü kesinlikle iyiden daha ağır basıyor

Hâlâ çalışmıyor ve hissediyorum onun için kötü eğer ben gidersem faturaları ödeyecek parası olmayacak ayrıca tüm varlığımla güzel köpeği seviyorum evet teknik olarak onu satın aldı ama ben onun hayatına altı aylıkken girdim ve o zamandan beri ona bakıyorum eve her hafta yemek yapıyorum ama oyuncakları ödülleri onu yürüyüşe çıkarıyorum veterinere götürüyorum vs. o benim kalbim ve ruhum gururum ve neşem dürüst olmak gerekirse onsuz mutlu olamayacağımı hissediyorum o harika bir arkadaş ve beni çok seviyor her zaman yanımda ama biliyorum ki eğer gidersem onu ​​almama izin vermez

bir terapistten yardım istiyorum

nasıl devam etmem gerektiğinden emin değilim çok üzgünüm

"Throw away account because I feel incredibly ashamed about this. 

I found out yesterday night that the girl I’ve been going out with for two months lied about her age. I’m completely devastated because this was my first good relationship. I was genuinely so happy and everything just fell apart. I feel like I’ve done something terrible. I can’t ask any advice from the people around me because I don’t want anyone to know. It’s legal to date a 17 year old where I live but it feels so wrong now that I know her real age. 

I thought she’s just a naturally very sweet and shy person but now I can’t stop thinking how that might have been because of her maturity level. This is my fourth relationship whereas it’s her second. I knew this and I was alright with it but that’s when I thought she’s 19. I already said I loved her and I don’t want to leave her because of this but it feels like it’s the right thing to do. 

When I was that age I was just a kid. She said I should just forget it and we can pretend like I never knew. I don’t know if that’s possible. I feel like a huge creep for even considering what to do, I just really cared about her and I was so happy with her. What in Gods name was going through her mind?

I feel shattered. What should I do? 

Edit: 

Thank you very sincerely to everyone who’s commented and given me advice. I haven’t told anyone in my personal life about this so I didn’t have anyone to talk to. It really means a lot.

She graduated Highschool and I had too when I was that age.

"My wife said something that terrifies me.

For backstory and context, when my wife and I first got together, she admitted she had no desire to have children due to 2 previous miscarriages in her last marriage. 4 years and a wedding later she came to me with the desire to be a mom. A few months later and she was pregnant. He was a happy healthy boy and everything seemed great at first. I slotted right into being a dad and he's my little ray of sunshine. 

My wife developed terrible PPD exacerbated by pumping anxiety. During a few arguments caused by her being overstimulated, she's admitted to me that she feels no emotional attachment to him and that he's just a child living in our home. She's been going to therapy and things seemed like they were getting better. Don't get me wrong, she's an amazing mother, always makes sure he's well cared for and has everything he needs or wants. But it's obvious she doesn't feel connected to him. Today, after a few particularly stressful days where he's been very needy and crying constantly (due to teething) she texted me while I was at work. It read ""He's pushing me to the edge. This morning I just wanted to put him in a hot car and walk away. I'm ripping my hair out and I'm in the middle of a mental breakdown, I just can't do the crying anymore."" I immediately made sure he was safe with my mom and arranged for her to watch him overnight. I talked with her more and it seems like this is just an out of the blue manic episode. I'm just terrified of what happens if she has another and she acts on those feelings. I don't know what to do here and it's killing me inside. ","eşim beni korkutan bir şey söyledi

arka plan ve bağlam için eşim ve ben ilk bir araya geldiğimizde, son evlilik yıllarındaki düşükler ve bir düğünden sonra çocuk sahibi olma isteği olmadığını itiraf etti, birkaç ay sonra anne olma isteğiyle bana geldi ve hamileydi, mutlu ve sağlıklı bir çocuktu ve ilk başta her şey harika görünüyordu, baba olmaya hemen uyum sağladım ve o benim küçük güneş ışığım

eşim, aşırı uyarılmasından kaynaklanan birkaç tartışma sırasında pompalanan kaygı nedeniyle kötüleşen korkunç bir doğum sonrası depresyonu geliştirdi, bana ona karşı duygusal bir bağ hissetmediğini ve onun sadece evimizde yaşayan bir çocuk olduğunu itiraf etti, terapiye gidiyordu ve her şey düzeliyor gibi görünüyordu, yanlış anlamayın, o harika bir anne, her zaman onun iyi bakıldığından ve ihtiyaç duyduğu veya istediği her şeye sahip olduğundan emin oluyor, ancak bugün ona bağlı hissetmediği açık, özellikle stresli birkaç günden sonra, çok muhtaç ve diş çıkardığı için sürekli ağlıyordu, işteyken bana mesaj attı, bu sabah beni uçuruma ittiğini yazıyordu, sadece onu sıcak bir arabaya koyup oradan uzaklaşmak istedim saçımı yoluyorum ve bir sinir krizinin ortasındayım artık ağlamaya dayanamıyorum hemen annemle güvende olduğundan emin oldum ve gece boyunca ona bakması için ayarladım onunla daha fazla konuştum ve bu sadece aniden ortaya çıkan bir manik atak gibi görünüyor sadece bir tane daha geçirirse ve o da bu hislere göre davranırsa ne olacağından çok korkuyorum burada ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum ve içim ölüyor"
"She's a police officer. I visited her at her apartment and found her having beer with some friends. They were all laughing and when I asked them what it's all about, my sister told me she hooked up with my best friend(28m). This came as a huge shock since he is devoted to his girlfriend(28).

I asked her how it happened and she said she threatened to plant drugs at his place and frame him as a drug dealer if he didn't have sex with her. So he did.

The next day, I talked to her when she was sober and she confirmed that she did do that stuff. It's just completely stumped me and now I don't know what to do about it. I don't know how to process this information. How? What do I do?

UPDATE : After reading some suggestions, I texted my sister to try to gather some evidence. She claimed she did it because she is in love with my friend. I will try to see what I can do next to get her to say more over texts.","o bir polis memuru, onu evinde ziyaret ettim ve birkaç arkadaşıyla bira içerken buldum, hepsi gülüyordu ve onlara ne olduğunu sorduğumda kız kardeşim bana en yakın arkadaşımla birlikte olduğunu söyledi, bu benim için büyük bir şok oldu çünkü o kız arkadaşına çok düşkün

"I (35m) and my husband (35m) have been married for years and have never faced a big issue like this one where neither one of us knows what the solution for it is.

To explain briefly,when my grandparents moved to my town they built their house and planted a tree in their yard which grew over the years.

My grandparents loved that tree so much because it felt like it grew alongside their family in a way,they always took good care of it especially my grandpa who nicknamed it 'Sally'.

My whole family including me have numerous pictures with that tree,some of us playing under it and others of my grandparents standing proudly next to it,it might seem silly but that tree genuinely meant a lot to all of us because we all played under it,we all sat under it and talked together,it just held a lot of memories.

My grandparents have sadly passed away from covid but I was fortunate enough to inherit their house,it's not a big fancy house by any means and I didn't care about that however my husband did.

He likes house renovations and wanted to do a whole makeover to the house since it was too old style for him,I didn't mind and told him he could do whatever he wanted to the house,he could paint it bright blue for all I cared.

What I didn't expect is to come back home from my work trip to find the tree gone,he cut off the whole tree because he wanted to start renovating the backyard for it to be more modern,to say i lost my shit would be an understatement and we had a massive argument about it.

He argued that I told him he could do whatever he wanted to the house so I couldn't back out now that he did something I didn't like but I find his argument invalid because I said the 'house' as in the structure not the tree and he should've known I wouldn't have wanted him to cut it down.

I know this is not the biggest issue ever but I am genuinely heartbroken over this,it wasn't just a tree to me or my family and now whenever I look outside I just see an empty space where it should've been,I tried to get over it but I still feel resentment towards him which I don't like.

I don't know how to fix this or how to get my point across for him,I don't want our relationship to fail because of a family tree but I am also deeply hurt that he didn't consider mine or my family's feelings at all.

Should I just let it go?or do I talk to him about it again even though I feel like it is useless since the tree is gone?I don't know,I just want help in how to get over this.","ben ve kocam yıllardır evliyiz ve ikimizin de çözümünün ne olduğunu bilmediğimiz böyle büyük bir sorunla hiç karşılaşmadık

kısaca açıklamak gerekirse, büyükbabam ve büyükannem kasabama taşındıklarında evlerini inşa ettiler ve bahçelerine yıllar içinde büyüyen bir ağaç diktiler

büyükbabam ve büyükannem o ağacı çok severdi çünkü sanki aileleriyle birlikte büyümüş gibi hissettiriyordu, özellikle de büyükbabam ona Sally lakabını takmıştı, her zaman ona iyi bakarlardı

ben de dahil olmak üzere tüm ailemin o ağaçla çok sayıda resmi var, bazılarımız altında oynuyoruz ve diğerlerimiz büyükbabam ve büyükannem gururla yanında duruyorlar, aptalca görünebilir ama o ağaç hepimiz için gerçekten çok şey ifade ediyordu çünkü hepimiz altında oynuyorduk, hepimiz altında oturuyorduk ve birlikte konuşuyorduk, sadece birçok anı barındırıyordu

büyükbabam ve büyükannem ne yazık ki covid'den vefat etti ama ben onların evini miras alacak kadar şanslıydım, hiçbir şekilde büyük ve gösterişli bir ev değildi ve ben bunu umursamadım ama kocam umursadı

ev tadilatlarını seviyor ve o zamandan beri evi baştan aşağı yenilemek istiyordu onun için çok eski modaydı aldırmadım ve ona eve istediğini yapabileceğini söyledim, umursadığım tek şey parlak maviye boyayabileceğiydi

beklemediğim şey, iş gezimden eve döndüğümde ağacın gitmiş olmasıydı, daha modern olması için arka bahçeyi yenilemeye başlamak istediği için tüm ağacı kesti, delirdiğimi söylemek yetersiz kalır ve bu konuda büyük bir tartışma yaşadık

ona eve istediğini yapabileceğini söylediğimi ve artık hoşlanmadığım bir şey yaptığı için geri adım atamayacağımı iddia etti ama argümanını geçersiz buluyorum çünkü evi yapı olarak söyledim, ağaç olarak değil ve kesmesini istemediğimi bilmeliydi

bunun şimdiye kadarki en büyük sorun olmadığını biliyorum ama bunun için gerçekten kalbim kırık, bu benim veya ailem için sadece bir ağaç değildi ve şimdi dışarı baktığımda olması gereken yerde sadece boş bir alan görüyorum, bunun üstesinden gelmeye çalıştım ama ona karşı hala hoşlanmıyorum

bunu nasıl düzelteceğimi veya amacımı nasıl anlayacağımı bilmiyorum onun için karşı karşıyayım, aile ağacı yüzünden ilişkimizin başarısız olmasını istemiyorum ama aynı zamanda benim veya ailemin duygularını hiç düşünmemiş olması beni derinden yaraladı

bırakmalı mıyım yoksa ağaç gittiği için bunun işe yaramadığını hissetsem bile onunla tekrar konuşmalı mıyım bilmiyorum sadece bunun üstesinden nasıl geleceğim konusunda yardım istiyorum"
"I (26F) have an OF. I do not use OF for any type of sw, although I am very much pro sw. I just don't have the body for it. 

However, last year was tough since leaving academia, so I gave OF a try. I exclusively post content about chess. Just giving tips on chess, as well as probability models related to chess (as I come from a math background). That's it. That's all I do. My clothes have never come off aside from one video where I was wearing a top instead of my usual t-shirt. Surprisingly, I make some money with it, ranging from 500€ per month to 2000€ per month. Not a huge living, but it helps with some bills. 

Well, some individuals online who I also most likely know in real life (I have a suspicion who they are, but I am not 100% sure) sent my OF to my parents. My dad laughed it off, and actually likes watching my chess content now, lol. My mom however... Well, let's just say that she has recently reported me for ""tax evasion"" (which I am not guilty of, we just have a difficult relationship and I went NC recently) has now shared my page with my employer, and other individuals in my personal life.

What do I do? Everyone seems to think that I do OF for sw, which I don't. Asking for them to subscribe just to show the proof sounds tacky. No idea what to do here. ","i if i'm var i'm herhangi bir sw türü için kullanmıyorum her ne kadar sw konusunda çok profesyonel olsam da bunun için vücudum yok

"This is going to be a very long one, I apologize in advance. My wife and I got married very recently this year, in a gorgeous ceremony, surrounded by our friends and family. We were together for 4 years prior. This last year has been monumentally stressful for the two of us, both work-wise and with the wedding planning. However, the day couldn't have been more perfect and it was undoubtedly the absolute best day of our lives, making all of the trouble and stress more than worth it.

I make very good money and provide for the both of us, while my wife takes care of finances/bills, plans our trips and generally keeps me uplifted when I'm stressed with work. I adore my wife, she's beautiful, smart, extremely well read and has always shared my sense of humor. When we met, I couldn't believe that there was someone as wonderfully goofy and weird as I was and I knew very early on that she was the one for me. We made it through the pandemic together, through distance at times and I never thought that anything could sway my feelings for her.

We booked an expensive honeymoon, in a tropical location, scheduled a few weeks after the wedding. She'd been there before and told me she had always wanted to go back. I paid, while she, as per usual organized the trip. The first few days were amazing. We're not super active on our vacations and were just happy to drink, go to the beach for the whole day and out to nice dinners in the evening. The second hotel we stayed at is where things took a turn.
While out, my wife and I started chatting to a few other couples at a beachside bar/restaurant. We're both very social, so we like asking other couples about themselves, sharing funny comparisons and including each other in the laughs. She was getting a little tipsy, but nothing too bad or out of the ordinary. At some point, she began to start slipping into 'drunk' territory and I started ordering us more food and suggesting she take it easy, which she obliged. Despite this, she later kept ordering more drinks. I asked her to please take it easy, because I know her pacing at this stage. She got quite agitated and stated that this was her honeymoon too and she wanted to relax. While talking some more, she got noticeably more drunk, pretty fast. I was talking to the couple on my right, when I heard my wife tell the girl next to her that she had a 'one that got away', who she wished she 'hadn't let go' and that she settled for me. My face, my stomach, my heart, everything dropped. I can't imagine what I must have looked like in that moment, but the people she was talking to got very quiet and awkward, the couple next to me tried changing the subject. Still, my wife went on.

She gestured toward me and began to discuss that I wasn't her type at all and went on to describe something entirely different. We had both made jokes in the past about not being each others initial type, but that since meeting each other, we were both the 'type' we both never knew we wanted. It seems this wasn't true on her end. She patted my head condescendingly and said ""unfortunately, this was the best I could do, but life goes on"". She wasn't laughing. She was completely deadpan. I was absolutely crushed. This didn't seem at all like the person I had been with over the last 4 years. I tried to get her to put her drink down, let me pay the check and leave when she outright snapped. The waitress had refused her when she asked for another drink and she stormed off to the bathroom. At this stage, the people she was talking to had migrated tables and the couple next to me were trying to reassure me, despite the bomb that had clearly gone off. I went to go check on her after a few minutes. This turned to 20 more minutes, after which the waiting staff had to go in and retrieve her. She had been getting sick in the bathroom. She didn't say a word to me when she got out and just grabbed her stuff. In the interim, the other couple had picked up our check, which I was incredibly embarrassed about, but grateful for. The parted ways saying ""happy honeymoon"" in awkward wincing smiles.

I left with her, feeling utterly dumbstruck, embarrassed, concerned and above all just heartbroken. She spent the entire walk back to the hotel saying that she knew I was embarrassed of her behaviour, adding ""you know what, I don't care, you're an embarrassment most of the time"". She went to point out that she that I was not funny or charismatic, as she had said in the past, but a clown, a laughing stock, and that our friends only put up with me out of niceties. She said that they all just saw me as a complete joke and that I was just too stupid to notice. This was all being screamed at me in front of as many people as you can imagine a popular destination spot would have walking around in the main town, all while I was trying to keep her from stumbling out onto the street. I had turned from embarrassed and upset to completely numb. I felt as though my marriage had detonated then and there. I'm ashamed to say this, but in that moment, I imagined leaving her as soon as I got back home and the ensuing embarrassment of having to explain to friends and family that my marriage had not even lasted a season without crumbling.

We were getting into a semi crowded elevator when she squirmed out and bolted off. I immediately ran back down 3 stories and spent the next 45 minutes trying to locate her on the hotel premise. Finally we got back to the room and she fell straight to sleep on the bed. I rolled her onto her side, tucked her in and got her water. We were going to our 3rd stop at a resort the following morning, so I just stayed up and packed. To say I felt empty inside is a complete understatement. She woke up about 2-3 hours later asking what had happened. Why I looked so upset. I asked if she was actually serious. If the most devastating part of our relationship, of any relationship I had ever been in had not JUST happened for her. She seemed anxious, as if it were less than half coming back to her, so I told her everything she had done, as calmly as I could. I told her how much she had hurt and embarrassed me with what she had said.

She was hysterical. She started screaming into the pillows, trying to hurt herself, screaming that she had ruined our honeymoon and our marriage, begging me not to leave her, telling me she didn't mean it. She was still fairly drunk. I told her to just go back to sleep, that I needed to go for a walk and have some time to think. She refused to give me it. She grabbed my arm while I asked her to let go, scratching me while I told her to just let me have space, screaming all the while. I stopped and just got into bed and told her I could not talk to her. We both went to sleep, but she woke me multiple times, telling me that we needed to talk through this and that I owed her that much. I just told her that I couldn't. I was shattered. I told her I didn't even know if I could finish the rest of the honeymoon and that I didn't know if I could go to the final resort we were staying at.

I woke the next morning. She had cancelled our 5 day resort stay that we were due to be at in 6 hours, of which I received no refund. She cried, she apologized, she begged for me to hear her out, but there was literally nothing that could fix what she had said and how she talked to me after, in that moment. She told me that it wasn't her, that she remembered none of it and that she couldn't even begin to think of why she had said and done those things. That it wasn't how she felt at all and that I was the best thing that had ever happened to her, that I had to believe her, after everything we had been through. Asking why I couldn't just trust her after all of this time together.

This is getting very long, so to put the rest of the trip briefly, she used her savings to pay for a very expensive resort for us that day, apologizing for cancelling the other one without asking first. She wanted to save the trip. For the rest of the trip she was remorseful, she was kind, she was sweet, she was the person that I had fallen in love with. She seemed just as shattered and upset as I was. I tried to make the most of the rest of our stay, but it was obvious that I was still heartbroken, despite trying to keep it together. She cried on the plane home and she cried most of the day we got back.
Fast forward a couple of very awkward, sad and tense days, she comes to me and lays out all of the changes she was going to make. She has always done the laundry but didn't really do a lot of the cleaning or cooking. In recent months she would often get agitated when I would finish work and start doing it. She promised to do all or at least most of the household stuff, to take the pressure off of me. She started dressing up, doing her makeup more often, she even cooked me a fancy dinner and decorated, to show how much she appreciated me and the life I had given her (her words, not mine). She told me that she had only said those things because she was insecure about not working, about herself in our friend group and how she had felt that our mutual friends liked me more than her. I don't believe that last part to be true in the slightest. More than half of them were actually her friends before they were mine. I asked about the 'one that got away', as difficult as it was and she said that she didn't know why she said that but she didn't feel that way. She said that I was her type, that I was the only one for her and that she would spend as long as it took to make it up to me.

We see a lot of relationship posts reuploaded to tiktok and one thing I absolutely cannot stand is that the couples cannot seem to fathom the concept of actually communicating to each other in situations like this... and that's what we did. We communicated. We talked openly and honestly. I told her firmly and candidly about all of the changes I needed. I asked about what I needed to change, what could have made her so full of contempt for me in that moment on our honeymoon and what we could both do to avoid it. Things started to pick up over the next few days and it seemed like things were going to be ok. There were some lingering things, of course. I wasn't initiating intimacy, I just couldn't. I felt like a complete loser. I felt completely undesirable. Questioning how anyone could see anything in me, if this is how she felt. She tried on multiple occasions, but I just asked her for time to recover. She gave me that space and reassured me that she would wait as long as it took for me to feel up to it again. We both always had a high sex drive and that was now completely shot.

Finally over time, we were intimate again, she cooked, cleaned, did sweet things for me, acted like she did when we first met. It really did feel like this whole nightmare might have been a net positive. Like it had kicked some things that were off in our relationship back into place. Like it was the wakeup call we needed. I still had intrusive thoughts, but we communicated and she would compliment and reassure me. She would constantly ask if how she was acting and the things she was doing for me were noticeable. I told her that they were and that I appreciated them and I tried to be more aware of any flaws I myself might have in my day to day.
It's been some weeks since then and things have started to slip back. The nice dinners stopped almost immediately, as did the nice gestures. She's started to become irritable with me with small things, unrelated to me. She's stopped doing household things consistently and is again irritable when I ask if she can help with them, while I'm working. I don't work the longest hours on earth by any means, but my work weeks are 60 to sometimes 70 hours. I'll find her downstairs playing video games or watching streams and asking her to help out is leading to strained discussions at times. She doesn't not do housework at all, but it's absolutely noticeably less already. She had started therapy through Betterhelp (I have no experience with that app and don't know if it is reputable) but that stopped after about 2 weeks. We have long discussions and things get better momentarily, but they keep resetting and I feel like I'm in a sate of déjà vu with everything. Again, I previously stated that I hate that couples can't just talk to each other in these kind of posts, but we've been talking. She'll turn around and still do sweet things, but I just can't bring myself to look past what happened sometimes and it's still eating at me. My confidence is completely fine some days and others it is just on the floor.

I still love her, but I cannot say with any confidence that I feel ""in love"" with her anymore and I don't know what to do. I never thought I would see myself on this end of one of these posts. She's talked to her mother about it and I cannot bring myself to say anything to my parents or friends. I'm so embarrassed and haven't been able to confide in anyone about this, aside from her. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. Any advice movement forward would be so appreciated. Have a wonderful day, all of you.

(TL;DR: My wife drunkenly said she settled for me and is still holding a candle for someone else, on our honeymoon. Then she said I was a joke)

Edit: Oh my goodness, thank you all for your messages, no matter what your opinions were, I appreciate all of them and I appreciate you all giving your time and advice. I only just work up, so sorry for not responding sooner. I really wasn't expecting this turnout in the comments. Being able to get the story off of my chest, outside of talking to her, is in itself some form of relief. 

I see a lot of people writing that my wife married me for the money. I really should have added that when we got engaged, we did not have much money at all. Sorry for not including it initially, I wrote this at around 1-2am my time, and the grammatical errors reflect that. We got engaged in the middle of the pandemic, work had dried up in my field and we were both banking on my plan to pay off. She always said she believed I could be successful, but I was by no means close to being financially sound when she said yes to marrying me. However that said, take from that what you will. 

I'm trying my best to read through all of the messages. I'll be honest, a lot are difficult to process. I see, acknowledge and appreciate the ones telling me to look out for my best interests, but also the ones telling me to actually ask my wife about her aspirations or goals, which surely cannot be sitting around/household tasks. In the past it's been touchy and/or difficult to get her to pursue the field of her degree. It's creative and daunting and she has often gotten defensive and dismissive of my help in the past. This morning I asked her to lay out a realistic and specific plan to get back into working, with the goal of working towards the career she actually wants.

I have never been to therapy, but I'm going to look into one on one sessions and go from there, no matter what outcome, after reading this, I clearly need to work on me, whatever that might entail. I'm going away on a trip with some guy friends for a couple of days and while they are our mutual friends, I'm going to try and open up to them as non-biased as I can. Thank you all for sharing your own past experiences so candidly with me and for the DM's also. I know that these next steps seem like baby steps and might be frustrating to read from your end, but we are both religious, divorce is not the option I want to go down if I can help it. However, you're all right. I cannot be miserable for the rest of my life and if no effort is made, it's looking like that might have to be a route. With that said, your words have given me comfort, and while they haven't restored all of my self confidence, they have shown me that I have to actually buck up, be more direct and not be so malleable.

I will update in the coming weeks. Thank you all so much again, I really mean it. Have a wonderful day, you kind souls.","this is going to be a very long one i apologize in advance my wife and i got married very recently this year in a gorgeous ceremony surrounded by our friends and family we were together for  years prior this last year has been monumentally stressful for the two of us both workwise and with the wedding planning however the day couldnt have been more perfect and it was undoubtedly the absolute best day of our lives making all of the trouble and stress more than worth it

i make very good money and provide for the both of us while my wife takes care of financesbills plans our trips and generally keeps me uplifted when im stressed with work i adore my wife shes beautiful smart extremely well read and has always shared my sense of humor when we met i couldnt believe that there was someone as wonderfully goofy and weird as i was and i knew very early on that she was the one for me we made it through the pandemic together through distance at times and i never thought that anything could sway my feelings for her

we booked an expensive honeymoon in a tropical location scheduled a few weeks after the wedding shed been there before and told me she had always wanted to go back i paid while she as per usual organized the trip the first few days were amazing were not super active on our vacations and were just happy to drink go to the beach for the whole day and out to nice dinners in the evening the second hotel we stayed at is where things took a turn
while out my wife and i started chatting to a few other couples at a beachside barrestaurant were both very social so we like asking other couples about themselves sharing funny comparisons and including each other in the laughs she was getting a little tipsy but nothing too bad or out of the ordinary at some point she began to start slipping into drunk territory and i started ordering us more food and suggesting she take it easy which she obliged despite this she later kept ordering more drinks i asked her to please take it easy because i know her pacing at this stage she got quite agitated and stated that this was her honeymoon too and she wanted to relax while talking some more she got noticeably more drunk pretty fast i was talking to the couple on my right when i heard my wife tell the girl next to her that she had a one that got away who she wished she hadnt let go and that she settled for me my face my stomach my heart everything dropped i cant imagine what i must have looked like in that moment but the people she was talking to got very quiet and awkward the couple next to me tried changing the subject still my wife went on

she gestured toward me and began to discuss that i wasnt her type at all and went on to describe something entirely different we had both made jokes in the past about not being each others initial type but that since meeting each other we were both the type we both never knew we wanted it seems this wasnt true on her end she patted my head condescendingly and said unfortunately this was the best i could do but life goes on she wasnt laughing she was completely deadpan i was absolutely crushed this didnt seem at all like the person i had been with over the last  years i tried to get her to put her drink down let me pay the check and leave when she outright snapped the waitress had refused her when she asked for another drink and she stormed off to the bathroom at this stage the people she was talking to had migrated tables and the couple next to me were trying to reassure me despite the bomb that had clearly gone off i went to go check on her after a few minutes this turned to  more minutes after which the waiting staff had to go in and retrieve her she had been getting sick in the bathroom she didnt say a word to me when she got out and just grabbed her stuff in the interim the other couple had picked up our check which i was incredibly embarrassed about but grateful for the parted ways saying happy honeymoon in awkward wincing smiles

i left with her feeling utterly dumbstruck embarrassed concerned and above all just heartbroken she spent the entire walk back to the hotel saying that she knew i was embarrassed of her behaviour adding you know what i dont care youre an embarrassment most of the time she went to point out that she that i was not funny or charismatic as she had said in the past but a clown a laughing stock and that our friends only put up with me out of niceties she said that they all just saw me as a complete joke and that i was just too stupid to notice this was all being screamed at me in front of as many people as you can imagine a popular destination spot would have walking around in the main town all while i was trying to keep her from stumbling out onto the street i had turned from embarrassed and upset to completely numb i felt as though my marriage had detonated then and there im ashamed to say this but in that moment i imagined leaving her as soon as i got back home and the ensuing embarrassment of having to explain to friends and family that my marriage had not even lasted a season without crumbling

we were getting into a semi crowded elevator when she squirmed out and bolted off i immediately ran back down  stories and spent the next  minutes trying to locate her on the hotel premise finally we got back to the room and she fell straight to sleep on the bed i rolled her onto her side tucked her in and got her water we were going to our rd stop at a resort the following morning so i just stayed up and packed to say i felt empty inside is a complete understatement she woke up about  hours later asking what had happened why i looked so upset i asked if she was actually serious if the most devastating part of our relationship of any relationship i had ever been in had not just happened for her she seemed anxious as if it were less than half coming back to her so i told her everything she had done as calmly as i could i told her how much she had hurt and embarrassed me with what she had said

she was hysterical she started screaming into the pillows trying to hurt herself screaming that she had ruined our honeymoon and our marriage begging me not to leave her telling me she didnt mean it she was still fairly drunk i told her to just go back to sleep that i needed to go for a walk and have some time to think she refused to give me it she grabbed my arm while i asked her to let go scratching me while i told her to just let me have space screaming all the while i stopped and just got into bed and told her i could not talk to her we both went to sleep but she woke me multiple times telling me that we needed to talk through this and that i owed her that much i just told her that i couldnt i was shattered i told her i didnt even know if i could finish the rest of the honeymoon and that i didnt know if i could go to the final resort we were staying at

i woke the next morning she had cancelled our  day resort stay that we were due to be at in  hours of which i received no refund she cried she apologized she begged for me to hear her out but there was literally nothing that could fix what she had said and how she talked to me after in that moment she told me that it wasnt her that she remembered none of it and that she couldnt even begin to think of why she had said and done those things that it wasnt how she felt at all and that i was the best thing that had ever happened to her that i had to believe her after everything we had been through asking why i couldnt just trust her after all of this time together

this is getting very long so to put the rest of the trip briefly she used her savings to pay for a very expensive resort for us that day apologizing for cancelling the other one without asking first she wanted to save the trip for the rest of the trip she was remorseful she was kind she was sweet she was the person that i had fallen in love with she seemed just as shattered and upset as i was i tried to make the most of the rest of our stay but it was obvious that i was still heartbroken despite trying to keep it together she cried on the plane home and she cried most of the day we got back

"Long story short. On Christmas morning of 2015 I was nearly beaten to death. It took a year but he was arrested and served a 5 year prison sentence.
Through my own path of trying to heal from what happened to me, and with the help of a therapist I have made an attempt at trying to forgive him for what he did. I was torturing myself with my hate and rage and forgiveness was the only way I could see a way out of a mindset that would have only kept on hurting me.
Recently I've been made aware that he is in a program, is sober, and is now trying to make amends for his lengthy list of transgressions.
He wants to meet up with me to extend an in person apology.
All of this correspondence has been through a mutual friend of ours who has kept tabs on him for me through the years.

I guess what I'm asking for advice about is, am I completely misguided? Am I being incredibly stupid in even considering letting this happen? Is this a bad fuckin idea? I think that hearing an apology would serve me well. It might help me finally close the book so to speak. Also, being willing to allow him to give the apology feels like it would be the right thing to do. I'm not saying I'm a fuckin saint or anything but I feel like if he's actually trying to better himself that maybe helping him would help me.

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Part of me still hates him for what he did and other parts just feel bad for him.







EDIT: I appreciate all of your replies. Honestly, the response I've gotten for this is overwhelming and I thank all of you for taking the time to give your opinions and advice.

I do feel like I need to clarify something. This is not a domestic violence situation. I'm a cis het male that ran afoul of a dangerous individual. That being said, all the replies regarding domestic violence are all valid and I hope anyone who read those replies and needed to hear that advice took them to heart. 




EDIT 2: I'm sorry for not replying to everyone but I promise I am reading everything and internalizing all of your thoughts. 



EDIT 3: I'd like to thank everyone again for all the kind words and useful advice that has been given. 

I've contacted the Victim's Services advocate in the county where this took place and asked about any restorative justice programs they may have. She said that while they don't have a program like that it's only because they've never done this before. However, she's going to talk to the DA and prosecutor of that case and see if they can facilitate a meeting. She suggested that the prosecutor, herself, and the main investigator of the case attend as well to have a law enforcement presence.

If he's truly on the straight and narrow then he should have no problem attending a meeting with them waiting in the wings.","uzun lafın kısası noel sabahı neredeyse dövülerek öldürülüyordum bir yıl sürdü ama o tutuklandı ve bir yıl hapis cezasına çarptırıldı

"Sorry if this is the wrong way to post an update. Things have been hard here.

Lisa met me for ""coffee"", I showed her evidence of Leo on Grindr. She believed me, alright. She cried, I tried to comfort her, she recoiled from me and started ramming into me. Apparently **I** ruined her life. **I** led Leo astray. **I** am personally to blame for her fiance cheating on her. I was trying to be understanding of her emotions and to comfort her anyway until the homophobic slurs started coming. She was always an LGBTQ ally so it was a huge shock. I left quickly after that, feeling like shit.

Lisa clearly told Leo it was me who outed him, he kept trying to call me, I refused all his calls. Then his car parked across the street from my apartment for some time though he never got out of it.

I'm in the dark, but it seems to me like Lisa and Leo are still together and they closed rank by designing me as the villain here somehow.

"I'm very new to reddit so pardon me if I don't do this correct!

I'm very concerned about my daughters sudden weight gain. She has been taking place in what's called a ""mukbang"" which is where people online film themselves eating large amount of food for views. My daughter has always enjoyed eating food, but in an amount that was considered normal. When she was younger she was more active and would dance and go to the gym with me, however about a 1 1/2 years ago I noticed a change. 

She used to go out and get unhealthy food once or twice a week to film for her TikTok. Her dad and I were okay with this since she would only eat half and give the rest to us. However recently she has been ordering a significant amount of food and eating it all almost EVERY day a week.

According to her, her ""fans"" enjoy watching her eat and donate money so she can buy more food. I'm very concerned about her health mentally and physically especially since she has gained a significant amount of weight in the last few months. She no longer dances and instead films multiple ""mukbangs"" a day so that she can continue to eat more food and make more money.

We have expressed our concern to her about her TikToks and her eating habits, yet she insists that she isn't being unhealthy. What do I do???","reddit'te çok yeniyim bu yüzden doğru yapmazsam beni mazur görün

kızımın ani kilo alımından çok endişeliyim, mukbang denilen bir şeyde yer alıyor, burada insanlar kendilerini izlenme için çok miktarda yemek yerken çevrimiçi olarak filme alıyorlar kızım her zaman yemek yemeyi severdi ama daha küçükken normal kabul edilen miktarda yemek yerdi daha aktifti ve benimle dans eder ve spor salonuna giderdi ancak yaklaşık bir yıl önce bir değişiklik fark ettim

eskiden haftada bir veya iki kez dışarı çıkıp sağlıksız yiyecekler alırdı tiktok için çekim yapardı babası ve ben buna tamam derdik çünkü sadece yarısını yer ve gerisini bize verirdi ancak son zamanlarda önemli miktarda yemek sipariş ediyor ve neredeyse haftada her gün hepsini yiyor

ona göre hayranları onun yemek yemesini izlemekten ve daha fazla yemek alabilmesi için para bağışlamaktan hoşlanıyorlar özellikle son birkaç ayda önemli miktarda kilo aldığından beri zihinsel ve fiziksel sağlığı konusunda çok endişeliyim artık dans etmiyor ve bunun yerine daha fazla yemek yemeye ve daha fazla para kazanmaya devam edebilmek için günde birden fazla mukbang çekiyor

ifade ettik Tiktok'ları ve yeme alışkanlıkları konusunda ona endişeleniyoruz ama o sağlıksız olmadığında ısrar ediyor, ne yapmalıyım?"
"I don’t know what to do. My (f28) finance ( m28) Alex has a bff ( Dani 28) since they were 4. She’s not like the usual Reddit bff. She’s a lovely sweet person who has never crossed boundaries with Alex or their two other friends Marcus and Daniel. The four are very close. Dani is gay and always was. She is very much a woman but likes to dress in jeans and t shirts and not in any feminine clothing. She is lean tall has short hair and  is just one of the boys in a lot of ways.  
 
This weekend was Alex Bachelor party. All four plus two other of Alex friends went along. It was to a costal town that’s well know for hosting bachelor and bachelorette parties but there’s no strip club or anything. They stayed in a b&amp;b and have scuba diving and kayaking planned. First night went ok dinner restaurant and night club and home. Last night was the issue. They did the nightclub and headed back to the house. Marcus and Daniel who are both single brought back two girls from the nightclub and got busy in their bedrooms. The rest were drinking in the living room but things got a bit loud and the two friends started complaining that they didn’t get to go to a strip club and never got to see t*ts and ass. They were blaming their wives and calling them names. Dani told them to shush as it was ruining the mood and they both thought it would be funny if they saw Dani’s body naked to make up for it. The thing is Alex joined in and they stripped her. She was screaming loudly and Marcus and Daniel came running and rescued Dani and put her in the a bedroom with the girls and had a fight with the three men. Daniel doesn’t drink due to a chronic medical condition and the medication he is on. So they packed up and took Dani and the two girls and left the other three. Dani was hysterical and Marcus wanted her to go to the police but she wouldn’t. She was afraid to go home so they ended up dropping the girls off and taking Dani to her parents which was an hour away. 

Marcus was at my door at 7am this morning and he told me what happened that if he ever sees Alex again he’s afraid of how things could go. He told me that if he can convince Dani to press charges he will . Then he left . 

Alex returned about 3 this afternoon. He was a ting normally until I told him Marcus has visited. He was very nervous and tried to play down what happened as a joke that got out of hand. I’m devastated. I heard him out but he knew I wasn’t accepting what he was saying. I told him Dani may be going to the police and he got very panicked and pale. He said she had him blocked and he wanted to go talk to her. I told him she wasn’t at her place as she was too afraid he or his “ buddies” would turn up there. I asked him to leave and he didn’t want to go but I insisted. He was crying saying it was a prank that got out of hand.   

I heard him out only as a courtesy to our two year relationship but I’m done. I don’t know this man. I don’t know if I should reach out to Dani or just do nothing. Marcus and I have been in constant contact and he agrees that I have no option but to end things. I don’t know where to start with cancelling everything as the wedding was in 5 weeks but it seems trivial compared to what Dani is going through right now. Marcus is convinced that Dani is going to the police after talking to her parents so I think Alex is in trouble. I can’t support him on this. Maybe I’m wrong as he was drunk and probably had taken other things but this was his friend from age 4 and he did this to her. I’ve not blocked Alex but I’ve not replied or picked up any of his calls. ","ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum f finance m alex'in bir bff'si var dani, onlar olduklarından beri o her zamanki reddit bff'si gibi değil o alex veya diğer iki arkadaşları marcus ve daniel ile sınırları hiç aşmamış tatlı ve sevimli bir insan dörtlü çok yakın dani eşcinsel ve her zaman öyleydi çok kadınsı ama kot pantolon ve tişört giymeyi seviyor ve kadınsı kıyafetler giymiyor zayıf uzun boylu kısa saçlı ve birçok yönden erkeklerden biri

bu hafta sonu alex'in bekarlığa veda partisi vardı alex'in diğer iki arkadaşıyla birlikte gittik bekarlığa veda partileriyle bilinen bir sahil kasabasına gittik ama striptiz kulübü veya başka bir şey yoktu bir bampb'de kaldılar ve tüplü dalış ve kano planladılar ilk gece iyiydi akşam yemeği restoran ve gece kulübü ve ev dün gece sorun oldu gece kulübüne gittiler ve eve geri döndüler ikisi de bekar olan marcus ve daniel gece kulübünden iki kızı geri getirdiler ve yatak odalarında meşgul oldular geri kalanı oturma odasında içki içiyordu ama ortalık biraz gürültülüydü ve ikisi arkadaşlar striptiz kulübüne gidemedikleri ve tts'yi hiç göremedikleri için şikayet etmeye başladılar ve eşlerini suçlayıp onlara isimler takıyorlardı dani onlara susmalarını söyledi çünkü bu havayı bozuyordu ve ikisi de dani'nin vücudunu çıplak görürlerse komik olacağını düşündüler telafi etmek için olay şu ki alex de katıldı ve onu soyup yüksek sesle çığlık atıyordu ve marcus ve daniel koşarak gelip dani'yi kurtardılar ve onu kızlarla bir yatak odasına koydular ve üç adamla kavga ettiler daniel kronik bir tıbbi rahatsızlık ve kullandığı ilaçlar nedeniyle içki içmiyor bu yüzden eşyalarını toplayıp dani'yi ve iki kızı alıp diğer üçünü bıraktılar dani histerikti ve marcus onun polise gitmesini istedi ama o gitmedi eve gitmekten korkuyordu bu yüzden kızları bırakıp dani'yi bir saat uzaklıktaki ailesinin yanına götürdüler

marcus bu sabah kapımdaydı ve bana olanları anlattı eğer alex'i bir daha görürse işlerin nasıl gidebileceğinden korkuyormuş bana dani'yi ikna edebilirse suç duyurusunda bulunmak için gitti sonra

alex bu öğleden sonra geri döndü, ona Marcus'un ziyarete geldiğini söyleyene kadar normal bir şeydi, çok gergindi ve olanları kontrolden çıkan bir şaka olarak göstermeye çalıştı, perişan oldum, onu dinledim ama söylediklerini kabul etmediğimi biliyordu, ona Dani'nin polise gidebileceğini söyledim ve çok panikledi ve solgunlaştı, onu engellediğini ve onunla konuşmak istediğini söyledi, ona evinde olmadığını çünkü kendisinin veya arkadaşlarının oraya gelmesinden çok korktuğunu söyledim, gitmesini istedim ve gitmek istemedi ama ağladığını söyleyerek bunun kontrolden çıkan bir şaka olduğunu söyledim

Onu sadece iki yıllık ilişkimize nezaketen dinledim ama bitti, bu adamı tanımıyorum, Dani'ye ulaşmalı mıyım yoksa hiçbir şey yapmamalı mıyım bilmiyorum Marcus ve ben sürekli iletişim halindeyiz ve o da benim işleri bitirmekten başka seçeneğim olmadığını kabul ediyor, her şeyi iptal etmeye nereden başlayacağımı bilmiyorum çünkü düğün haftalar sonra ama Dani'nin söyledikleriyle kıyaslandığında önemsiz görünüyor şu an neler oluyor marcus dani'nin ailesiyle konuştuktan sonra polise gideceğine ikna olmuş durumda bu yüzden bence alex başının dertte bu konuda onu destekleyemem belki yanılıyorum çünkü sarhoştu ve muhtemelen başka şeyler de almıştı ama bu onun yaşıtlarından arkadaşıydı ve bunu ona o yaptı alex'i engellemedim ama cevaplamadım veya aramalarından hiçbirini açmadım"
"I’m not sure if I’m overreacting due to my own personal background but I am pretty lost and upset over this.

My mother spends a good amount of time with my daughter, they have a pretty good relationship. My mother recently got back with her previous husband (who is a lot younger than her) and he came to visit for a couple weeks. My daughter was pretty excited to see my mother’s bf/fiancé again and asked to spend the night at grandma’s. I agreed thinking nothing of it, my mother’s bf is someone I deemed “safe,” as he has been a part of the family for a long time prior. 

My daughter comes to me the next morning and tells me he made her very uncomfortable. She goes on to explain how she was too scared to sleep alone in the next room and wanted to sleep in the bed with my mother. This is normal.

 What’s not normal however, is she tells me my mother’s bf proceeded to cuddle her the entire night. In her words, held her so tight she couldn’t move or sleep the whole night. She said he was “readjusting” every five seconds and scooted closer and closer to her. Was holding her hand and saying “goodnight I love you” every hour. She also said he put his leg over her. She said she could feel an inappropriate body part, he was so close. She said he also was acting very strange the next morning by constantly checking on her and asking if she was okay, which sounds like a guilty conscience to me. 

All of this obviously is very alarming, I’m still trying to process it all. He was the last person I would have ever expected to be a creep. 

I have no idea what to do or how to react other than thanking her for telling me, and removing him from being around her at all moving forward. I know my mother will brush me off or be insulted at my “insinuation” that he is a creep. It will worsen our recently renewed relationship, as I know she will take his side. I’m not sure how to bring it up to her or when or anything. I just need advice on how to move forward. ","kendi kişisel geçmişimden dolayı aşırı tepki verip vermediğimden emin değilim ama bu konuda oldukça kaybolmuş ve üzgünüm

kızım ertesi sabah yanıma geldi ve bana onun kendisini çok rahatsız ettiğini söyledi, yan odada tek başına uyumaktan çok korktuğunu ve annemle yatakta uyumak istediğini anlattı, bu normal

ancak normal olmayan şey, annemin erkek arkadaşının ona bütün gece boyunca sarıldığını, onu öyle sıkı tuttuğunu, hareket edemediğini ve bütün gece uyuyamadığını söylemesi, her beş saniyede bir kendini ayarladığını ve ona giderek yaklaştığını, elini tuttuğunu ve iyi geceler dediğini söyledi, aşkım her saat o da onun bacağını onun üzerine koyduğunu söyledi o çok yakındı o uygunsuz bir vücut parçası hissedebildiğini söyledi o ayrıca ertesi sabah sürekli onu kontrol ederek ve iyi olup olmadığını sorarak çok garip davrandığını söyledi bu bana suçluluk duygusu gibi geliyor

"I looked through my husband’s photos and found he had screenshotted pictures of my 14 year old daughter (his step daughter) leaving for school.

I’m trying to convince myself this wasn’t anything weird, however, this video must be 6 months plus old and she is wearing a more than usual revealing outfit in the video. 

I just don’t think this is random, he would have had to dig for the video.

He also screenshotted multiple shots from the same video and the time stamps say’s it was around 3am. 

He and I have a daughter (4F) and I’m 9 weeks pregnant.

Am I over reacting in thinking the worse? 

This is the first time anything like this has happened.

I’m devastated. He and I have been together for 5 years but have known each other almost 10.  He is generally a good person (so I thought) and though our relationship isn’t perfect, we do have more happy moments than not.

I just don’t know what to do. Has anyone ever been through something like this?

Edit to add:
I know the video is older than a month. I’m not sure how old. It was during the day. Either going to school or our community park.

Her outfit was a crop top tshirt, she has plenty of non crop top shirts. 

He screenshotted the video this morning at 3am. I found them when I woke up around 5am. 

I plan to ask him when he wakes up why he has the photos.

They don’t have any abnormal issues that I have seen, I ask from time to time if she is happy he is part of our lives. She’s never indicated any bad feelings but she is 14 and hates any boundary setting adult.



","kocamın fotoğraflarına baktım ve üvey kızının okula gittiği yaşındaki kızımın ekran görüntüsünü aldığını gördüm

sadece bunun rastgele olduğunu düşünmüyorum, videoyu bulmak için kazması gerekirdi

ayrıca aynı videodan birden fazla karenin ekran görüntüsünü aldı ve zaman damgaları sabahın erken saatlerinde olduğunu söylüyor

"I (24F) recently had an abortion just four days ago. My partner (30M) and I decided to have sex, and I was very clear with him that he needed to use a condom because I’m extremely fertile. I also told him I was afraid it might hurt, and to his credit, he kept checking in on me during the intercourse for the most part. However, he took the condom off midway without telling me, and I only realized after the fact.

When I brought it up, he acted like it wasn’t a big deal and dismissed my concerns. Now, I’m left feeling really really bad about the whole situation, especially given what I just went through.

The fact that he was checking in on me and being kind has me conflicted. Am I thinking too deeply about this? How should I approach this situation? Should I bring it up again and confront him?

"I'm genuinely so anxious about this. An older man next to me is connecting to Thailand to meet a girl he met online. Sounds suspicious, but, totally possible. I have family that met their wife online abroad and all are happy. 

But then he showed me a picture of her 30 year old daughter. It's AI art, I am 100% sure. Like not great AI art. 

He's mentioned not having great vision. It's his first time leaving the country. He didn't even realize the flight was gonna be 14 hours (he said like 5, because of the time change). He joked I burst his bubble when I told him it was like 14. 

I doubt if I say anything he would listen. Maybe I'm wrong. I feel like I should tell him that I find that photo suspicious and just if anything feels off at some point, listen to that instinct. 

Is there a common scam? Is he in serious danger? Should I say anything?

Update:

I talked more with the man and it sounded less suspicious as we talked and more like a green card play than anything. He's never sent her money, he only paid for his flight, not the accommodations, etc.

He wasn't like some old grandpa, he was about 60. Not great with his phone, but not the type to fall for a social security scam level of naive. 

I did point out the red flags I saw and showed him how to download the Bangkok map offline to his phone and write down the embassy number. I also explained some common scams to watch out for. 

His family and friends knew about the trip. 

I jotted down his flight info and got his phone number. I passed on most of the details to the US embassy in Thailand and Human Trafficking tip line.

"I was opening a jar of jam and I knocked on my maids door on her day off to see if she could help me open it. After she tried I noticed she had my earrings on. I immediately checked my jewelry box to see that they were missing and they were. 
I really don’t know what to do and honestly I feel like crying. Not because she took my earrings, but because I trusted her so much. She is my favorite maid out of all the ones I had before. She was so sweet and kind. She even said if she had a daughter she would name her after me. I really felt bonded to her. What’s most upsetting is the principle.

I trusted her. She took something of mine

Every time we go out, we ALWAYS come home with dresses or things for her or her kids.

If she had said to me or my mom that she wanted a pair of earrings WE WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THEM and a matching dress to fit.

Her son is sick and IMMEDIATELY we gave her money and I took my birthday money and gave it to her too.

It’s just upsetting because, why? 
I really really trusted her.

If I tell my mom she will definitely get in trouble.

Advice please…

**** EDIT: I talked to my mom and she said her safe was tampered with and she had placed a large amount of money somewhere and it went missing. She didn’t think anything of it but now she is. I really appreciate all the comments advising me to tell my mom because it seems like it wasn’t a new problem and she isn’t what we thought she was. 

***Edit again
This whole situation is finally coming to a close, and I would really like to say I appreciate all of the supportive and helpful comments I have received. I actually let my mom read through them too and she said it helped her gain different perspectives on how to handle the situation. She confronted her, and things are being handled now! Thank you guys so much for the help! 


To the people who commented about me asking to open a jar do not have enough context. The weeks in the past on her day off I went and made her breakfast. I made her cookie dough on one occasion. We took care of her when she had a flu. Further more, I was home alone and I had tried MANY times to open it before asking. It had been the first time I asked her for anything on her day off.

"Hey second time posting on reddit here apparently in this short time drama keeps coming our way. My wifes friend of about 9 years has confessed his feelings for her out of the blue. Ive known him for a bit now and Ive always trusted my partner so there is zero jealousy when it comes to this. 

I mentioned early in our relationship I had a feeling from certain things he did that made me tell her that he may have feelings for her. She’s said she’s known him since they were kids and there is no way that could be true. Either way it never really bothered me, recently we became public that we are having a baby together and Ive never been more happy. It really is such a different kind of joy :)

Yesterday he asked her for a call and from what she said he fully confessed he has romantic feelings towards her. He said through the 9 years its been on and off his feelings as he convinces himself it would never work between them. She came to me very upset saying well you can say I told you so ect, but that’s really something that I care to do. 

The thing is she wants me to message him and even before her asking me that I was ready to rip him a new one but I sat on it and decided being verbally aggressive may not be the right choice here Im quite a big dude and through my life ive been told I can come across as very intimidating, again not the approach I want here.

Might be weird to ask reddit for advice here but I thought why not I don’t technically have to follow it and getting some outside perspective might be good.

So anyways if you were in this situation or have been how would you approach messaging her friend.

","hey reddit'e ikinci kez yazıyorum görünüşe göre bu kısa sürede dramlar başımıza gelmeye devam ediyor karımın yaklaşık yıllardır arkadaşı ona olan duygularını aniden itiraf etti onu bir süredir tanıyorum ve partnerime her zaman güvendim bu yüzden bu konuda hiç kıskançlık yok

ilişkimizin başlarında onun yaptığı bazı şeylerden dolayı ona karşı duyguları olabileceğini söylememe neden olan bir his olduğunu söylemiştim o da onu çocukluklarından beri tanıdığını söyledi ve bunun doğru olması imkansızdı beni hiç rahatsız etmedi yakın zamanda bir bebeğimiz olacağını kamuoyuna duyurduk ve hiç bu kadar mutlu olmamıştım bu gerçekten çok farklı bir neşe

dün onu aramasını istedi ve söylediklerinden ona karşı romantik duygular beslediğini tamamen itiraf etti yıllar boyunca inişli çıkışlı olduğunu söyledi duyguları kendini ikna ettiği için aralarında asla yürümeyecekmiş gibi çok üzgün bir şekilde yanıma gelip ""sana demiştim"" diyebilirsin ama bu gerçekten yapmak istediğim bir şey

mesele şu ki benden ona mesaj atmamı istiyor ve hatta sormadan önce bile ben ona yeni bir tane patlatmaya hazırdım ama oturup sözel olarak saldırgan olmanın burada doğru seçim olmayabileceğine karar verdim oldukça iri bir adamım ve hayatım boyunca bana yine çok korkutucu görünebileceğim söylendi burada istediğim yaklaşım bu değil

burada reddit'ten tavsiye istemek garip olabilir ama neden olmasın diye düşündüm teknik olarak uymak zorunda değilim ve biraz dışarıdan bakış açısı edinmek iyi olabilir

her neyse eğer bu durumda olsaydın veya olduysan arkadaşına mesaj atmaya nasıl yaklaşırdın"

"What do I do? My sister and her friend are 13 years old and in middle school. Im 23. My sister doesn't talk to this girl anymore but someone sent my sister the video and I'm guessing they distributed the video to a bunch of people at school. The video was recorded by the guy recording the bj.

It's CP, so should I report it to the school? I'm very nervous about it. I've been thinking about reporting thus girl for a while because she posts tik tok videos of herself vaping. My sister has been showing me these videos. 

I stumbled upon the CP because I was very worried my sister was up to no good so I did a bad and snooped on her gallery. Luckily, she didn't do anything bad herself but I can't say the same about her friends  

UPDATE: I slept it over and in the morning decided to talk to my sister about it before I do anything. I talked to my sister about it and she confessed that the girl in the video told the guy to record it and distributed it herself to make this other guy jealous. I reported it to the school and they said they said they will contact the proper authorities. 

I have also contacted a lawyer in my area and they explained that CP possession requires intent. Both me and my sister didn't look for the video and we deleted it as soon as it was sent so we are in no legal trouble. Hopefully, the school and police will deal with this issue soon.  Thanks so much for the advice!

güncelleme uyudum ve sabah bir şey yapmadan önce kız kardeşimle konuşmaya karar verdim kız kardeşimle konuştum ve videodaki kızın adama kaydetmesini söylediğini ve diğer adamı kıskandırmak için kendisinin dağıttığını itiraf etti okula bildirdim ve yetkili makamlarla iletişime geçeceklerini söylediler

ben ayrıca bölgemdeki bir avukatla iletişime geçtim ve bana cp bulundurmanın kasıtlı olduğunu açıkladılar, hem ben hem de kız kardeşim videoyu aramadık ve gönderildiği anda sildik, bu yüzden yasal bir sorunla karşı karşıya değiliz, umarım okul ve polis bu sorunla yakında ilgilenir, tavsiyeniz için çok teşekkür ederim

bu arada herkes bana f diyor"
"I (28m) married my ex-wife (Amy, 29f) too young, we got married at 19 cause we had been high school sweethearts and thought we were gonna be together forever, we got divorced last year after she had an affair (3 years long) with her now-fiancé (Erica, 30f) when I found out about the affair Amy was pregnant with our first child and so we still have contact with each other, but needless to say I don't like Erica and vice versa. 2 months ago she gave birth to our daughter, and this weekend her parents came from England to meet the baby, and when they got to my house (The baby lives with me because Amy and Erica live in a dangerous area) it was good, me and Erica didn't argue like we normally do, and everyone was having a good time, until Erica started making jokes about me divorcing Amy cause she came out as Bisexual, how I didn't want her involved in the pregnancy stuff (Doctor's appointments, being in the delivery room, etc. Me and Amy agreed before we divorced that it would just be us at things like that) and how I wouldn't hate her \[Erica\] if she had been a man, and I said ""No that's not what happened, you two had been having an affair for 3 years and I found out, and I hate you because you had an affair with my wife when you knew she was married. If you were a man I'd hate you just as much, maybe even more. It has nothing to do with the fact that you're lesbian, you had an affair with my wife that's why I hate you, and the reason I didn't want you involved in any pregnancy stuff is because you're not one of \[daughter's name\] parents."" Her parents were confused and asked what I meant and said that Amy said we divorced because she came out and I couldn't handle it and never mentioned an affair, I told them to ask Amy and she said it was true, they looked mortified and said that they thought they'd raised her better than to cheat on their significant other, and they left and went back to the hotel they were staying at. Later they told Erica and Amy they weren't paying for their wedding anymore after that Amy was pissed off at me and said I had no right telling her business and if she wanted her parents to know she would've told them herself. I feel kind of bad, but what was I supposed to do, sit back while Erica told lies about me and made me look bad, but I'm not sure, is it my fault, should i try and fix things with her parents","eski karım amy f ile evlendim çok genç yaşta evlendik çünkü lise aşıklarıydık ve sonsuza dek birlikte olacağımızı düşünüyorduk geçen yıl boşandık onun şimdiki nişanlısı erica f ile yıllarca süren bir ilişkisi oldu ben ilişkiyi öğrendiğimde amy ilk çocuğumuza hamileydi ve hala birbirimizle görüşüyoruz ama söylememe gerek yok erica'yı sevmiyorum ve tam tersi aylar önce kızımızı doğurdu ve bu hafta sonu ailesi ingiltere'den bebeği görmek için geldiler ve evime geldiklerinde bebek benimle yaşıyor çünkü amy ve erica tehlikeli bir bölgede yaşıyorlardı bu iyiydi erica ve ben normalde yaptığımız gibi tartışmadık ve herkes iyi vakit geçiriyordu ta ki erica benim amy'den boşandığımla ilgili şakalar yapmaya başlayana kadar çünkü amy biseksüel olduğunu açıkladı hamilelik işlerine karışmasını istemediğimi doktor randevularına doğum odasına girmesini istemediğimi söyledi amy ve ben boşanmadan önce böyle şeylerde sadece ikimizin olacağı konusunda anlaştık ve erica eğer erkek olsaydı ondan nefret etmeyeceğimi söyledim ve hayır dedim bu böyle olmadı Yıllardır ikisinin ilişkisi vardı ve ben öğrendim ve senden nefret ediyorum çünkü karımla evli olduğunu bildiğin halde ilişki yaşadın eğer bir erkek olsaydın senden nefret ederdim belki daha da fazla Bunun lezbiyen olmanla hiçbir ilgisi yok Karımla ilişki yaşadın bu yüzden senden nefret ediyorum ve seni herhangi bir hamilelik olayına karıştırmak istemememin sebebi kızımın adının anne ve babası olmaman Ebeveynleri kafası karışmıştı ve ne demek istediğimi sordular ve Amy'nin boşandığımızı söylediğini çünkü onun dışarı çıktığını ve bununla başa çıkamadığımı ve asla bir ilişkiden bahsetmediğimi söyledi Onlara Amy'e sormalarını söyledim ve bunun doğru olduğunu söyledi Çok utanmış göründüler ve onu eşlerini aldatmaktan daha iyi yetiştirdiklerini düşündüklerini söylediler ve ayrıldılar ve kaldıkları otele geri döndüler Daha sonra Erica ve Amy'ye artık düğünlerinin masraflarını karşılamayacaklarını söylediler Ondan sonra Amy bana sinirlendi ve ona işlerini anlatma hakkım olmadığını ve eğer ailesinin bilmesini isteseydi kendisi anlatırdı Kendimi biraz kötü hissediyorum ama ne yapmam gerekiyordu Erica benim hakkımda yalanlar söylerken arkama yaslandım ve beni kötü gösterdi ama bunun benim hatam olup olmadığından emin değilim, ailesiyle aramı düzeltmeye çalışmalı mıyım?"
"I know it sounds absolutely terrible, but I genuinely don't know what to do anymore. I made some posts about my husband's odd behavior regarding our daughter (6 now, 5 at the time) and her artwork. To sum things up, he was destroying/throwing away the art she was making, without telling me, and lying about it. I had confronted him about it, but he got defensive and went so far as to break our art supplies afterwards. 

I dropped off our daughter with my mom before trying to talk to him again, since I was nervous, honestly. I didn't know what he'd do. It's been over a year since then at this point, but basically, I told him that I was worried. That he was acting really erratic, and that I really thought he should try and get some help. And... he agreed. I was so relieved, and we talked about getting in touch with a therapist, trying to figure out why he was so against the art. He told me at the time that he didn't know why it bothered him, but I'm not really sure if he was lying or not. 

Things were fine for a couple weeks, with him leaving and going to therapy, and our daughter being happy and fine. Honestly, I thought that was the end of it. That he had some issue, but was working on it. Except I was completely wrong. I got home one night after being out with some friends, and he told me that he didn't feel comfortable being around our daughter. I was absolutely taken off guard, because I thought he was doing better, and moreso i didn't think it was this big of a deal. Not to the point of being worried about safety. Looking back, it wasn't the right choice, but I begged him not to go. It didn't matter anyway, he packed up some clothes, and left after checking on our daughter who was asleep. I was crushed. He didn't even wait until morning to say a proper goodbye to her, and this whole thing just came out of the blue.

He drove a couple hours away to a hospital closer to where his family lived, and admitted himself. I felt just so numb and confused, because obviously I would support him no matter what, but this felt like such a rapid escalation that I just didn't know how to handle. 

And that's basically where we are now. It's basically been a little over a year, and he's still there. There was one hell of an adjustment period, but I promised him that I was there for him no matter what. That I still love him, that I'm proud of him for working on himself. And I mean all that, I really do. But things just aren't getting better. At first we spoke most days, either on just the phone or on video call. But it got less and less, until now where he maybe calls me once a week. Our daughter has adjusted so well, but I think she's getting a sense of permanence about it all, and I can't say I blame her. It's feeling pretty permanent to me, too. 

I don't even know truthfully *why* he's still there. Not that I knew why he went in the first place. I ask him about it, but he gets weird and dodgy, and I just can't bring myself to fight it. He's got a right to privacy, but at the same time, I'm his wife! I wish I wasn't quite as much a pacifist. 

Recently, I was talking with my BIL, who's one of my only inlaws who still really talks to me. My MIL basically doesn't say a word to me, even when I reach out. Sometimes she'll ask about my daughter, but it's just... depressingly silent. But BIL still acts like i'm family, which I am. And he came over recently, and we were talking. And he mentioned that he visited my husband. 

I was utterly speechless. My husband hasn't let me or our daughter visit. I understand that a brother is different, but still, I'm his wife. I just don't really know what to do about it. BIL said that my husband seems to be doing better, seems happier, but I don't know what to believe anymore. My husband still refuses to give any sort of timeline on how long he's planning to stay in the hospital, and I'm at the end of my rope. 

I promised that I'd love and support him, but I just feel so alone. I feel like he doesn't really talk to me anymore, let alone *love me*. And honestly, my daughter seems just as happy as she was before, if not happier. She gets upset about her daddy sometimes, but most of the time it's almost like she's forgotten about him. I used to try and make sure she still felt connected, still felt like her daddy was a part of her life, but as of late it's just... hard to feel right doing so. The man barely talks to us anymore. 

I don't want to be married anymore. Not like this. I feel like scum even thinking about it, but I just can't imagine ever returning to normal after this. I basically haven't known what's going on with my husband for over a year now, and I've never felt so alone in my entire life. And I can't help but feel like maybe if I just... end things, that I might be able to start feeling okay again.

Am I being stupid? Should I keep trying to push through this with my husband, or am I maybe in the right for at least exploring the option of divorce? I don't know what to do, and could really use some advice about all this. ","biliyorum kulağa kesinlikle korkunç geliyor ama gerçekten ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum kocamın kızımızla ilgili tuhaf davranışları ve sanat eserleri hakkında birkaç paylaşım yaptım özetle, bana söylemeden yaptığı sanat eserlerini çöpe atıyordu ve bunun hakkında yalan söylüyordu onunla yüzleştim ama savunmaya geçti ve sonrasında sanat malzemelerimizi kıracak kadar ileri gitti

gergin olduğum için tekrar konuşmaya çalışmadan önce kızımızı anneme bıraktım dürüst olmak gerekirse ne yapacağını bilmiyordum o zamandan bu yana bir yıldan fazla zaman geçti ama temelde ona çok dengesiz davrandığından endişelendiğimi ve yardım alması gerektiğini düşündüğümü söyledim ve o da kabul etti çok rahatladım ve bir terapistle iletişime geçmek hakkında konuştuk neden sanata bu kadar karşı olduğunu anlamaya çalışıyordum o zamanlar bana neden rahatsız olduğunu bilmediğini söyledi ama yalan söyleyip söylemediğinden gerçekten emin değilim

birkaç hafta boyunca her şey yolundaydı, o gitti ve terapiye gitti ve kızımız mutlu ve iyiydi dürüst olmak gerekirse bunun son olduğunu düşündüm bir sorunu olduğunu ama üzerinde çalıştığını ama tamamen yanılmış olduğumu söyledim, bir gece arkadaşlarımla dışarı çıktıktan sonra eve geldim ve bana kızımızın yanında rahat hissetmediğini söyledi, tamamen hazırlıksız yakalandım çünkü daha iyi olduğunu düşünüyordum ve dahası bunun bu kadar büyük bir sorun olduğunu düşünmedim, güvenlik konusunda endişelenecek kadar değil, geriye dönüp baktığımda doğru bir seçim değildi ama ona gitmemesi için yalvardım, önemli değildi, neyse, birkaç parça giysi alıp gitti, uyuyan kızımızı kontrol ettikten sonra, çok üzüldüm, ona uygun bir şekilde veda etmek için sabahı bile beklemedi ve tüm bunlar ansızın oldu

birkaç saat uzaklıktaki, ailesinin yaşadığı yere daha yakın bir hastaneye gitti ve kendini hastaneye yatırdı, kendimi çok uyuşmuş ve kafam karışık hissettim çünkü ne olursa olsun onu destekleyeceğim belliydi ama bu o kadar hızlı bir tırmanıştı ki nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyordum

ve şu anda temelde bulunduğumuz yer burası, temelde bir yıldan biraz fazla oldu ve o hala orada, cehennem gibi bir uyum süreci oldu ama ona ne olursa olsun yanında olacağıma söz verdim, hala seviyorum onunla gurur duyuyorum, kendisi üzerinde çalıştığı için ve gerçekten yaptığım her şeyi kastediyorum ama işler ilk başta düzelmiyor, çoğu gün ya sadece telefonda ya da görüntülü görüşmede konuşuyorduk ama giderek azaldı, ta ki haftada bir kez beni arayana kadar. kızımız çok iyi uyum sağladı ama sanırım bu konuda bir kalıcılık duygusu ediniyor ve onu suçlayamam, bana da oldukça kalıcı geliyor

aslında neden hala orada olduğunu bilmiyorum, ilk başta neden gittiğini bilmiyordum ama ona bunu sordum ama garip ve şüpheli davranıyor ve bununla savaşmaya kendimi getiremiyorum, mahremiyet hakkı var ama aynı zamanda karısıyım, keşke bu kadar pasifist olmasaydım

son zamanlarda kayınvalidemle konuşuyordum, hala benimle gerçekten konuşan tek kayınvalidemden biri, kayınvalidem bana tek kelime etmiyor, hatta bazen ona ulaştığımda bile kızım hakkında soru soruyor ama sadece iç karartıcı bir şekilde sessiz ama kayınvalidem hala ailedenmişim gibi davranıyor, ki ben öyleyim ve yakın zamanda yanıma geldi ve konuşuyorduk ve o Kocamı ziyaret ettiğinden bahsetti

Tamamen konuşamadım, kocam beni veya kızımızı ziyarete izin vermedi, bir kardeşin farklı olduğunu anlıyorum ama yine de karısıyım, bu konuda ne yapacağımı gerçekten bilmiyorum, bil, kocamın daha iyi göründüğünü söyledi, daha mutlu görünüyor ama artık neye inanacağımı bilmiyorum, kocam hala hastanede ne kadar kalmayı planladığına dair herhangi bir zaman çizelgesi vermeyi reddediyor ve artık dayanamıyorum

Onu seveceğime ve destekleyeceğime söz verdim ama kendimi çok yalnız hissediyorum, artık benimle gerçekten konuşmadığını, beni sevmediğini hissediyorum ve dürüst olmak gerekirse kızım eskisi kadar mutlu görünüyor, hatta daha mutlu, bazen babası hakkında üzülüyor ama çoğu zaman onu unutmuş gibi oluyor, eskiden hala bağlı hissettiğinden emin olmaya çalışıyordum, hala babasının hayatının bir parçası olduğunu hissediyordu ama son zamanlarda bunu yapmak doğru hissettirmiyor, bu yüzden adam artık bizimle neredeyse hiç konuşmuyor

Artık evli olmak istemiyorum, böyle değil, bunu düşündüğümde bile kendimi pislik gibi hissediyorum ama bir daha asla eskisi gibi olamayacağımı hayal bile edemiyorum normal bundan sonra kocamla bir yıldan fazla bir süredir neler olup bittiğini temelde bilmiyorum ve hayatım boyunca hiç bu kadar yalnız hissetmemiştim ve belki de her şeyi bitirirsem tekrar iyi hissetmeye başlayabileceğimi hissetmekten kendimi alamıyorum

aptalca mı davranıyorum, kocamla bunu atlatmaya çalışmaya devam etmeli miyim yoksa en azından boşanma seçeneğini araştırmakta haklı mıyım, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum ve tüm bunlar hakkında gerçekten biraz tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var"
"While my (29f) boyfriend (33M) was getting open heart surgery, I was looking through his phone and found a second Snapchat app. Upon clicking on it, I find 2 years worth of messages between him and some girl including sexting, voice memos, pictures etc. I was devastated. I took the liberty of calling the girl up so I could get some more information. She tells me that they have been in a virtual relationship for 2 years and he has been sending her thousands of dollars (which I did find screenshots on his phone of receipts of $1500+ to her). 

Once my bf made it out of surgery and was weaned off the vent, I decided not to say anything since he was fresh out of open heart surgery. It’s been 2 days and he’s been in so much physical pain he states he does not wish this pain on his worst enemy. I decided not to say anything to him at the moment and wait until he gets ahold of his phone and sees the messages I sent to his lover. 

His family decided to wait a couple days before they come see him as to not upset his mom. They believe she will deteriorate in her health upon seeing him in pain which I think is ridiculous. His brother entrusted me to my bf’s care. 

Am I making the right call on waiting until he physically feels better? I’ve already decided I am ending this relationship no ifs ands or buts. Should I tell his family what he did? 

UPDATE: 

I want to share what happened after his surgery. The day following the operation (Friday), he expressed his gratitude for my support and said he didn't know what he’d do without me. He kept saying he loved me and promised that once he left the hospital, he would make things right by marrying me and apologized for the years of waiting. Although I was aware of his infidelity, I stayed silent, unsure of how to respond.

Last night (Saturday), with him being moved from ICU to a general floor, I decided to take y’all’s advice and confront him about the cheating. I told him I needed to discuss something important and revealed that I knew about his affair over the past two years. That I had discovered this while he was in surgery. He was visibly shocked and deeply remorseful. I asked why he continued to promise marriage while being unfaithful. He claimed he had been trying to end the affair, including pretending his surgery was on Monday to make it seem like he had passed away and to cut off the relationship with the side piece. I questioned why he waited so long to act, and he admitted to feeling guilty but didn’t provide a good enough explanation.

At that point, I was done with the conversation and suggested he call her to take over his care. I had to leave for work, and while I haven’t yet informed his family, I plan to do so once I’ve had time to process everything.

Thank you all for your advice. 

LAST AND FINAL UPDATE 

After confronting him about the cheating, I visited him one last time at the hospital to drop off some of his belongings before his discharge. He apologized for his actions, admitting he was stupid and took me for granted. I asked if he had spoken to the side piece, and he said he hadn’t but was trying to end that relationship, even deleting his Snapchat account. Whether this was true or not didn’t matter to me, as it wouldn’t have changed my decision to leave him. He broke down in tears, and I advised him to seek therapy for his issues with lying, sexting, and giving money to other women. I told him I didn’t hate him and that I forgave him for my own peace of mind, but that our relationship was over. Later that day, I informed his brother about the situation. His brother responded, ""Hi, this is totally unexpected, so I’m not sure what to say. I’m sorry for the harm he has caused you. I will speak to him once he is back to normal.""

And that was the end of it. I am feeling a little better at the moment but I understand that this wound will take time to heal. I thank God I found this out now as opposed to waiting until after marriage and having kids. I greatly appreciate all of y’all’s comments and encouraging words. You all have helped me tremendously. God bless. ","erkek arkadaşım açık kalp ameliyatı olurken telefonuna bakıyordum ve ikinci bir snapchat uygulaması buldum, tıkladığımda onunla bir kız arasında geçen yıllara ait mesajları buldum, sesli mesajlar, fotoğraflar vs. çok üzüldüm, daha fazla bilgi alabilmek için kızı arama özgürlüğünü aldım, bana yıllardır sanal bir ilişki içinde olduklarını ve ona binlerce dolar gönderdiğini söyledi, telefonunda makbuzların ekran görüntülerini buldum

erkek arkadaşım ameliyattan çıktıktan ve ventilatörden çıkarıldıktan sonra hiçbir şey söylememeye karar verdim çünkü açık kalp ameliyatından yeni çıkmıştı, günler geçti ve çok fazla fiziksel acı çekti, bu acıyı en büyük düşmanına bile istemediğini söylüyor, şu anda ona hiçbir şey söylememeye ve telefonunu eline alıp sevgilisine gönderdiğim mesajları görene kadar beklemeye karar verdim

ailesi, annesini üzmemek için onu görmeye gelmeden önce birkaç gün beklemeye karar verdi, onu acı içinde görünce sağlığının bozulacağına inanıyorlar, bence bu saçma, erkek kardeşi beni erkek arkadaşımın bakımına emanet etti

Fiziksel olarak daha iyi hissedene kadar beklemek doğru bir karar mı? Bu ilişkiyi bitirmeye karar verdim, eğer ve ama yok, ailesine ne yaptığını söylemeli miyim?

Güncelleme

Ameliyattan sonra neler olduğunu paylaşmak istiyorum, ameliyattan sonraki gün cuma günü desteğim için minnettarlığını dile getirdi ve bensiz ne yapacağını bilmediğini söyledi, beni sevdiğini ve hastaneden ayrıldıktan sonra benimle evlenerek her şeyi düzelteceğine söz verdiğini ve yıllarca beklediği için özür dilediğini söyledi, sadakatsizliğinin farkında olmama rağmen sessiz kaldım, nasıl cevap vereceğimi bilmiyordum

Dün gece cumartesi günü yoğun bakımdan genel bir kata alındığında, sizin tavsiyenizi dinlemeye ve aldatma konusunda onunla yüzleşmeye karar verdim, ona önemli bir şey konuşmam gerektiğini söyledim ve son iki yıldır ilişkisini bildiğimi, bunu ameliyat sırasında keşfettiğimi söyledim, açıkça şok olmuştu ve derin bir pişmanlık duyuyordu, sadakatsiz olmasına rağmen neden evlilik sözü vermeye devam ettiğini sordum, ilişkiyi bitirmeye çalıştığını iddia etti pazartesi günü ameliyat olduğunu iddia ederek ölmüş gibi göstermek ve yan parçayla ilişkiyi kesmek de dahil olmak üzere neden harekete geçmek için bu kadar uzun süre beklediğini sorguladım ve suçlu hissettiğini itiraf etti ancak yeterince iyi bir açıklama yapmadı

o noktada konuşmayı bitirdim ve ona bakımını devralması için onu aramasını önerdim işe gitmek zorunda kaldım ve henüz ailesine haber vermedim ancak her şeyi sindirmek için zamanım olduğunda bunu yapmayı planlıyorum

tavsiyeleriniz için hepinize teşekkür ederim

son ve nihai güncelleme

aldatma konusunda onunla yüzleştikten sonra taburcu olmadan önce eşyalarından bazılarını bırakmak için onu son kez hastanede ziyaret ettim aptal olduğunu ve beni hafife aldığını kabul ederek yaptıkları için özür diledi yan parçayla konuşup konuşmadığını sordum ve konuşmadığını ancak ilişkiyi bitirmeye çalıştığını söyledi hatta snapchat hesabını sildi bunun doğru olup olmadığı benim için önemli değildi çünkü onu terk etme kararımı değiştirmezdi gözyaşlarına boğuldu ve ona yalan söyleme, sexting yapma ve diğer kadınlara para verme sorunları için terapi almasını önerdim ondan nefret etmediğimi ve kendi huzurum için onu affettiğimi ama ilişkimizin o gün daha sonra bittiğini, durumu kardeşine bildirdiğimi, kardeşinin ""merhaba, bu tamamen beklenmedik bir şey, bu yüzden ne söyleyeceğimi bilmiyorum, sana verdiği zarar için üzgünüm, normale döndüğünde onunla konuşacağım"" diye yanıt verdiğini söyledi

ve bu kadardı, şu anda kendimi biraz daha iyi hissediyorum ama bu yaranın iyileşmesinin zaman alacağını anlıyorum, bunu şimdi öğrendiğim için Tanrı'ya şükür, evlenip çocuk sahibi olmayı beklemek yerine, hepinizin yorumlarını ve cesaretlendirici sözlerini çok takdir ediyorum, hepiniz bana çok yardımcı oldunuz, Tanrı sizi korusun"
"Today on my way home from university I was riding my skateboard and I ate shit. Decently bad, I scraped up my knee and my hand and my elbow. Two girls came over to me and asked if I was okay. I couldn't talk because I was winded but when I could breathe, I got up and said thank you. Then I took the board from the girl who was holding it and they told me to have a nice day and I said ""you too"". Then I dipped. Once I got to my car I told my girlfriend what happened on text and suddenly she accusing me of cheating and why am I so nice to people and that I'd do anything for a girl if she asked.

"I'm a F22 and my roommate is a 23M. We have a unique connection—while our other roommates were away, we ended up cuddling every night. A few days ago, we slept together while under the influence, and now I'm developing feelings for him. I really dislike being in this situation. It’s not awkward between us, but I hate that it feels secretive. I can't stand the thought of him bringing home another girl, and I know he doesn’t want a relationship.

Should I tell him how I feel, or suggest that we stop our physical relationship? I'm feeling really confused and need some guidance.

"UPDATE: I talked to my husband about this before she got home from work. He brought up that it also made it uncomfortable, but wasn’t sure how to handle it as it has only been going on for about 5 days (since we got back.) So we set firm boundaries. Thank you to everyone in the comments for validating my feelings, and giving me good advice. When she couldn’t lay by him on the couch at all I could clearly see it made her upset. Especially when he pushed her away. I talked to her separately and explained why these boundaries are set, and why it wasn’t ok to be cuddling him like that. She did break down, and told me it truly wasn’t anything sexual, she just needed love. That’s when she told me she was worried bc I hadn’t been as affectionate towards her lately, but I explained it’s because I’m in a lot of pain. Pregnancy really messes with scoliosis. We had a great talk and I think we can finally move past this. As for therapy, I’m signing everyone up Monday morning, and adding a sexual abuse therapist in for her. 

My (23F) husband (24M) have had custody of my younger siblings (17F and 18F) for 2 years now. The oldest one moved out a couple months ago to be with her long term boyfriend. 

I was preface that my husband and I have been together since the youngest one was 13, and have always gotten along. However, it has never been like this. She never even used to sit next to him. (The reason with have custody of her was because of ongoing sexual abuse from her father that I also experienced. So she isn’t really good around men.) 

Last week we took her to Kalahari Resort for her birthday for a 3 day trip. During that 3 day trip she had a mental breakdown, because I’m 15 weeks pregnant, and she is afraid with the new baby along with her turning 18 next July we are just going to abandon her. She thinks this because she feels like she is a burden on us, and she feels that since our legal obligation ends at 18 we won’t care about her anymore. Which isn’t true at all. During this break down my husband hugged her because she was crying and obviously upset. 

Fast forward to two days later. We are now home and I notice she’s been purposely pushing me away from my husband on the couch, getting under the same blanket as him, laying her head on his shoulder, and cuddling him. Which is weird for her especially since she has such a tough time around men. I asked my husband about it later, and he said she sees him like a father figure, and it makes her feel comfortable. I tell him I’m ok with that. However I do have to admit it makes me feel a little weird, but that’s only because of the things that happened to me as a child, but I’m not going to project my insecurities onto a child like that. 

This has consistently been going on everyday since we got back, and I’ll admit it has gotten annoying to be constantly told by her to scoot over. Anyway it all came to a head last night when I came downstairs to get a drink, and see her with her arms wrapped around him laying on top of his chest while they were laying on the couch. His arms weren’t around her, but she kept nuzzling her face into his chest. I don’t why, but it made me feel super uncomfortable (to the point I was shaking) and I went upstairs. Immediately my husband knew something was wrong, and told me we could talk about it. We had a talk and he reassured me nothing was going on. I told him we need to tell her this cuddling stuff has to stop, it’s making me super uncomfortable. He said we shouldn’t say anything to her, because it would hurt her feelings, and that she only does it in crisis mode. But it’s literally every day now. 

He then told me she has laid on his chest like that before, but when I came home she jumped up. He said he would make it to where she won’t cuddle like that with him anymore, but I honestly think we should have a talk about boundaries with her. 

I don’t know if I’m the asshole, because I could be reading into this too much due to the sexual abuse I faced, but at the same time I don’t want to feel uncomfortable in my own home. I do think she doesn’t know what boundaries are, and that a talk could help, but I also don’t want to upset her.

geçen hafta onu doğum günü için günübirlik bir gezi için kalahari resort'a götürdük, o gezi sırasında zihinsel çöküntü yaşadı çünkü ben haftalık hamileyim ve yeni bebeğinin yanı sıra gelecek temmuzda doğum yapmasıyla onu terk edeceğimizden korkuyor, bunu bize yük gibi hissettiği için düşünüyor ve yasal yükümlülüğümüzün sona erdiği günden beri artık onu umursamayacağımızı düşünüyor, ki bu hiç de doğru değil bu çöküntü sırasında kocam ona sarıldı çünkü ağlıyordu ve belli ki üzgündü

iki gün sonra şimdi evdeyiz ve beni bilerek kocamdan uzaklaştırdığını fark ettim, kanepede onunla aynı battaniyenin altına giriyor, başını omzuna koyuyor ve ona sarılıyor, özellikle de çok zor zamanlar geçirdiği için bu onun için garip erkeklerin etrafındayken daha sonra kocama sordum ve bana onu bir baba figürü olarak gördüğünü ve bunun kendisini rahat hissettirdiğini söyledi, ona bunun sorun olmadığını söyledim ancak itiraf etmeliyim ki bu beni biraz garip hissettiriyor ancak bunun tek sebebi çocukken başıma gelenler ancak güvensizliklerimi böyle bir çocuğa yansıtmayacağım

geri döndüğümüzden beri her gün bu şekilde devam ediyor ve itiraf etmeliyim ki sürekli olarak bana yanaşmamı söylemesi can sıkıcı olmaya başladı her neyse dün gece aşağı inip bir içki almak için geldiğimde ve onu kollarını ona dolamış bir şekilde, kanepede uzanırken göğsünün üstünde yatarken gördüğümde her şey patlak verdi, kolları ona dolanmamıştı ama yüzünü göğsüne sürtmeye devam ediyordu nedenini bilmiyorum ama bu beni çok rahatsız etti, titreyecek noktaya geldim ve hemen yukarı çıktım kocam bir şeylerin ters gittiğini anladı ve bana bunun hakkında konuşabileceğimizi söyledi, konuştuk ve bana hiçbir şey olmadığı konusunda güvence verdi, ona bu sarılma olayını bırakmamız gerektiğini söylememiz gerektiğini söyledim, beni çok rahatsız ediyor, yapmamamız gerektiğini söyledi ona bir şey söyle çünkü bu onun duygularını incitecek ve bunu sadece kriz modunda yapıyor ama artık kelimenin tam anlamıyla her gün yapıyor

sonra bana daha önce göğsüne böyle yattığını ama eve geldiğimde ayağa fırladığını söyledi ve artık onunla böyle kucaklaşmayacağı noktaya geleceğini söyledi ama dürüst olmak gerekirse onunla sınırlar hakkında konuşmamız gerektiğini düşünüyorum

ben pislik miyim bilmiyorum çünkü cinsel tacize uğradığım için bunu fazla abartıyor olabilirim ama aynı zamanda kendi evimde rahatsız hissetmek istemiyorum bence sınırların ne olduğunu bilmiyor ve konuşmanın yardımcı olabileceğini düşünüyorum ama onu üzmek de istemiyorum"
"ok guys, so the title is obvious. yesterday when my gf was in p.e class, some pos took her phone and went through my texts with her. they saw everything about her calling me good boy and all that. they then starting calling her a slut and a bop. i am fucking pissed. i want to hurt somebody. i know if this gets to any of my family members i am done for. i just switched to this school because i thought it would be better. i feel like my relationships have been ruined. they know my only secret and i cant do anything about it. please help.",tamam çocuklar başlık çok açık dün kız arkadaşım beden eğitimi dersindeyken biri telefonunu alıp mesajlarımı okudu her şeyini gördü bana iyi çocuk dediğini falan sonra da ona sürtük ve orospu demeye başladılar çok sinirliyim birini incitmek istiyorum biliyorum eğer bu ailemden birine ulaşırsa biterim bu okula geçtim sadece daha iyi olacağını düşündüğüm için ilişkilerimin mahvolduğunu hissediyorum tek sırrımı biliyorlar ve bu konuda hiçbir şey yapamıyorum lütfen yardım edin
"My mom and I work at a small family owned clinic, and most patients are low income or homeless. yesterday I answered the phone and it was a woman with a man in the background telling her what to say. I asked her all the usual questions and he would yell at her and tell her exactly what to say. He took the phone towards the end of the call and asked if I could fax him all her medical records so he had proof of who she was. I told him I can’t, and that if he called me the next day I would talk to my boss about it. 

I know it’s against the rules but I went home and looked her up on facebook, She is homeless and we had a few mutual facebook friends. While looking her up i found out she has been missing from my state since February of this year and the area code that she called from was in Texas. 

I told my boss and he told me to call the man back, I called him back today and asked for the woman I previously spoke to. Every time I would ask “can she come to the phone? its about her medical records” He would dodge my question and tell me “oh shes in the bathroom” or “shes asleep” Until after about 5-10 minutes he said “ill call you back in 5 minutes, ill go get her.” 

About 15 minutes later the woman called me and was barely able to speak and was very clearly not in her right mind, the man in the background kept yelling and then whispering to her “ask them to send your records.” I told them id call them back tomorrow and get it all figured out. I think this woman is clearly in trouble, Theres been a ton of kidnapping attempts this year in my state and all of the cars had Texas,Oklahoma, or Arkansas plates. 

What do I do? Im seriously worried about her and i’m not sure how to safely or properly go about this because even if she is there on her own free will, I still want to make sure shes safe. 

I HAVE POSTED A UPDATE!!","annem ve ben küçük bir aile kliniğinde çalışıyoruz ve hastaların çoğu düşük gelirli veya evsiz dün telefonu açtım ve arka planda bir erkekle bir kadın vardı, ona ne söyleyeceğini söylüyordu ona tüm olağan soruları sordum ve adam ona bağırıp tam olarak ne söyleyeceğini söyledi aramanın sonuna doğru telefonu aldı ve ona kim olduğunu kanıtlamak için tüm tıbbi kayıtlarını fakslayabilir miyim diye sordu ona yapamayacağımı ve eğer beni ertesi gün ararsa patronumla konuşacağımı söyledim

bunun kurallara aykırı olduğunu biliyorum ama eve gittim ve onu facebook'ta aradım evsizmiş ve onu ararken birkaç ortak facebook arkadaşımız vardı bu yılın şubat ayından beri eyaletten kaybolduğunu ve aradığı alan kodunun texas olduğunu öğrendim

patronuma söyledim ve bana adamı geri aramamı söyledi bugün onu geri aradım ve daha önce konuştuğum kadını sordum her sorduğumda telefona gelebilir mi tıbbi kayıtlarıyla ilgiliydi sorumu geçiştirdi ve bana ah tuvalette olduğunu söyledi yaklaşık dakika sonra uyuyordu, dedi ki seni birkaç dakika içinde geri arayacağım, gidip onu alacağım

yaklaşık birkaç dakika sonra kadın beni aradı ve zar zor konuşabiliyordu ve çok açık bir şekilde aklı başında değildi arka plandaki adam bağırmaya ve sonra ona fısıldamaya devam etti kayıtlarını göndermelerini istedim onlara yarın onları geri arayacağımı ve her şeyi çözeceğimi söyledim bence bu kadın açıkça başının dertte bu yıl eyalette bir sürü kaçırma girişimi oldu ve tüm arabaların plakaları TexasOklahoma veya Arkansas

ne yapmalıyım onun için ciddi şekilde endişeleniyorum ve bunu nasıl güvenli veya doğru bir şekilde yapacağımı bilmiyorum çünkü orada kendi isteğiyle olsa bile yine de güvende olduğundan emin olmak istiyorum

He then put his head in his hands before saying, ""Thank you, brother. God bless. God bless.""

Did I do something wrong?","ona yemek getirdiğim için gerçekten üzgün görünüyordu ve uyumak için bir yer için para almaya çalıştığımı söyledi, eğer insanlar yemeği görürlerse beni düşünecekler

Update? First of all RIP my notifications I did not expect this magnitude of a response. So I've read through a lot of comments and most are pretty redundant, criticizing my parenting and a lot of reddit doctors. I will say this, you all do not live in my house, you all do not know the chores and responsibilities there are expected of my son. He is expected to straighten up his room every day, he is expected to deep clean his room once a week. However we are human and his dad and I both work but we work opposite shifts, we also have a toddler in the house. This is not meant to be an excuse but more so of context that we are not always ""on top of it"" shit falls through cracks sometimes. There is also the assumption that his room got that bad over a long period of time. No. It got that had over the course of a couple days due to schedule changes, marching band competitions, and doctors appointments for everyone in the house but me. I know everyone is saying he's depressed but when he has seen several doctors and therapists over the last few months alone and none of them have raised any concerns about depression, I'm gonna go with he's not depressed. You gotta think he was asked point blank if this issue was due to depression or laziness and he said without skipping a beat that it was just laziness, and then asked 5 more times ""are you sure you are not depressed, now is the time to ask for help if you are, there is no shame if you are we need you to he honest so we can figure this out"" and it was still insisted that he is not depressed, why should I think otherwise? His doctors say he isn't, his therapist say he isn't, he says he isn't. So I'm gonna go with he's not depressed. Now to the next point. His bio mom has not been in his life for 7 years now, his parents splitting isn't new and he has received counseling regarding it and worked out issues surrounding it beautifully. As for his medication, those of you who are anti adhd medication I can PROMISE you he is so much worse off not on his medication. As for the dogs. My dogs are 99% potty trained and get let out once an hour. The 1% they are not potty trained is when they see carpet and I don't know why. I protested the installation or carpet till I was blue in the face but my father in law who was paying for the flooring in our house as well as my husband out voted me and that was that, I will not be out voted again as I am a firm believer that the idea of carpet is gross in and of itself but it is also not compatible with kids and pets. My son participates in several extracurricular activities, marching band, chess club, bowling team, and baseball. He is at the age where he doesn't like playing outside, he doesn't like hanging out with his parents and we get it, we offer but we don't force him nor place any expectations that he has to do stuff with us. As for punishments go, taking away his video games has never been an effective punishment, if it were, then this would've been solved years ago, it is just at its worst right now compared to the basic messy room 4 years ago.  I will try to respond to comments and questions but can't guarantee much as i am a busy busy person. Thank you to those who have been helpful and non judgmental. This is a problem that I wasn't trained to navigate in step-mom school and one that I have no experience in because I have never been a teenage boy before. 


EDIT: We did shampoo his carpet, this is when we found everything that caused me to make this point. After a long conversation when he got home. He says he is not depressed and does not want to step away from his video games. I believe he isn't depressed, he's very outgoing and social and always wants to go do things. Beyond the hygiene and uncleanliness, he does not show any other signs of depression and we asked him MULTIPLE times. He is currently on medication for ADHD. 


The title sounds harsh but I see no light at the end of this tunnel. My 14y/o stepson is gross, not only in his complete disregard for hygiene, but in the way he's okay with living. Getting this kid to shower properly/brush his teeth/use deodorant is already like pulling teeth. He already hoards garbage, food, dishes in his room, but has now starting peeing in empty soda cans and glasses he keeps in his room. The dogs will pee in his room and he won't tell us so we can clean it and then will sleep on the dog piss soaked carpet. Like I cannot fathom how he is okay living this way and how to get him to care. He's a freshman in high school and we were kinda hoping that friends and peers commenting on his odor and such would make him care because us having sit down convos is not working, but he says no one says anything to him about it despite our pleads to just be clean. We've tried letting him pick out his own toiletries so he would maybe get excited about using that stuff but the last time we bought him body wash was 6+ months ago so he's clearly not even using it. I just don't get it and don't know what to do.","güncelleme öncelikle bildirimlerimi kaldırın bu kadar büyük bir yanıt beklemiyordum bu yüzden bir sürü yorum okudum ve çoğu oldukça gereksiz ebeveynliğimi ve bir sürü reddit doktorunu eleştiriyor bunu söyleyeceğim hepiniz benim evimde yaşamıyorsunuz oğlumdan beklenen işleri ve sorumlulukları bilmiyorsunuz her gün odasını toplaması bekleniyor haftada bir odasını derinlemesine temizlemesi bekleniyor ancak biz insanız ve babasıyla ben çalışıyoruz ama zıt vardiyalarda çalışıyoruz ayrıca evde bir yürümeye başlayan çocuk var bu bir bahane değil daha çok her zaman her şeyin üstünde olmadığımız bağlamı ifade ediyor bazen işler bozulur ayrıca odasının uzun bir süre boyunca bu kadar kötü olduğu varsayımı da var hayır bu birkaç gün içinde program değişiklikleri, bando yarışmaları ve evdeki herkesin doktor randevuları nedeniyle oldu biliyorum herkes onun depresyonda olduğunu söylüyor ama son birkaç ayda birkaç doktor ve terapist gördü ve hiçbiri depresyon konusunda herhangi bir endişe dile getirmedi ben depresyonda olmadığını söyleyeceğim Sanırım ona bu sorunun depresyondan mı yoksa tembellikten mi kaynaklandığı açıkça soruldu ve hiç duraksamadan bunun sadece tembellikten kaynaklandığını söyledi ve sonra daha fazla kez sordu, emin misin depresyonda mısın şimdi yardım istemenin zamanı eğer öyleyse utanılacak bir şey yok eğer öyleyse dürüst olmana ihtiyacımız var böylece bunu çözebiliriz ve hala depresyonda olmadığı konusunda ısrar edildi neden başka türlü düşüneyim ki doktorları onun olmadığını söylüyor terapisti olmadığını söylüyor o da olmadığını söylüyor o yüzden depresyonda olmadığını söyleyeceğim şimdi bir sonraki noktaya biyolojik annesi yıllardır hayatında değil anne babasının ayrılması yeni bir şey değil ve bu konuda danışmanlık aldı ve bununla ilgili sorunları güzel bir şekilde çözdü ilaç tedavisine gelince antidepresan ilaç kullananlarınız size ilaç kullanmadığında çok daha kötü durumda olduğunu garanti edebilirim köpeklere gelince benim köpeklerim tuvalet eğitimli ve saatte bir dışarı çıkıyorlar tuvalet eğitimli değiller halı gördüklerinde ve neden halı veya döşemeye karşı çıktığımı bilmiyorum yüzüm mosmor olana kadar ama evimizin döşemesini ödeyen kayınpederim kocam beni oyladı ve bu da bir daha oylanmayacağım anlamına geliyordu çünkü halı fikrinin kendi başına iğrenç olduğuna inanan biriyim ancak çocuklarla ve evcil hayvanlarla da uyumlu değil oğlum birkaç ders dışı aktiviteye katılıyor bando satranç kulübü bowling takımı ve beyzbol dışarıda oynamayı sevmediği bir yaşta, ailesiyle takılmayı sevmiyor ve bunu anlıyoruz, teklif ediyoruz ancak onu zorlamıyoruz veya bizimle bir şeyler yapması gerektiğine dair herhangi bir beklentimiz yok. ceza olarak video oyunlarını elinden almak hiçbir zaman etkili bir ceza olmadı, eğer öyle olsaydı bu yıllar önce çözülmüş olurdu, şu anda yıllar önceki temel dağınık odayla karşılaştırıldığında en kötü durumda yorumlara ve sorulara yanıt vermeye çalışacağım ancak çok meşgul ve yoğun bir insan olduğum için çok fazla garanti veremem, yardımcı olan ve yargılayıcı olmayanlara teşekkür ederim bu üvey anne okulunda üstesinden gelmek için eğitilmediğim ve hiçbir deneyimim olmayan bir sorun çünkü daha önce hiç ergenlik çağında bir çocuk olmadım

düzenleme halısını şampuanladık bu noktada bu noktayı ortaya koymama neden olan her şeyi bulduk eve geldiğinde uzun bir konuşma yaptı, depresif olmadığını ve video oyunlarından uzaklaşmak istemediğini söyledi, depresif olmadığına inanıyorum, çok dışa dönük ve sosyal ve her zaman hijyen ve pisliğin ötesinde şeyler yapmak istiyor, depresyonun başka belirtilerini göstermiyor ve ona birkaç kez sorduk, şu anda DEHB için ilaç kullanıyor

başlık sert geliyor ama bu tünelin sonunda ışık göremiyorum üvey oğlum sadece hijyene olan tamamen aldırmazlığıyla değil, aynı zamanda yaşamayı kabul etme biçimiyle de iğrenç, bu çocuğun düzgün bir şekilde duş almasını sağlamak, dişlerini fırçalamak, deodorant kullanmak zaten diş çektirmek gibi, odasında çöp yemek kaplarını biriktiriyor ama şimdi boş soda kutularına ve odasında tuttuğu bardaklara işemeye başladı, köpekler odasına işeyecek ve bize söylemiyor, böylece temizleyebiliriz ve sonra köpek işemesiyle ıslanmış halıda uyuyor, bu şekilde yaşamayı nasıl kabul ettiğini ve onu nasıl umursamasını sağlayacağımızı anlayamıyorum, lise birinci sınıf öğrencisi ve arkadaşlarının ve akranlarının kokusu ve benzeri şeyler hakkında yorum yapmasını umuyorduk onun umurunda çünkü oturup konuşmalarımız işe yaramıyor ama temiz olması için yalvarmamıza rağmen kimse ona bu konuda bir şey söylemiyor. kendi tuvalet malzemelerini seçmesine izin vermeyi denedik böylece belki o ürünleri kullanmak konusunda heyecanlanabilir ama ona en son vücut losyonu aldığımızda aylar geçti ve açıkça onu bile kullanmıyor. anlamıyorum ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum."
"It’s been almost a year. My son is now 14, and we have been no contact with him since the incident. He lasted about a month with his father, and moved in with his paternal grandparents. For the last nine months, I’ve been in contact with his probation officer and the courts as the case for his arson trial moves forward. He will do drugs testing, therapy, and the grandparents volunteered to be a type of guardian that provides shelter, meals, clothing and school. They refuse to take on actual guardianship because they do not want any financial responsibility should he get in trouble with the law. I don’t either but I find it to be fair and have nothing against their stance. 

We moved into a home and my daughter and I have been living a life that wasn’t possible - or at the least, easy enough to feel possible - when he was with us. She is STILL on a waitlist for an outpatient therapist, but we still see the school counselor and talk about anything she can in the meantime. She mentions negative emotions, hurt and confusion regarding her brother sometimes. She definitely needs a therapist, and we will see one, but she is a sweet and loving girl who is thriving socially and excelling academically, with zero behavioral issues. I feel for her and she is the absolute light of my life. 

The week started off pleasantly. We skipped a day of school (she does not usually miss, I swear! She got an award/party for her attendance) and we went to Disneyland. I sent out the invites for her birthday this week, and I even felt so great I had a cheat meal or two. 

I got a voicemail on Friday at work. It was the police. They said my son was in their custody at the time, and cps would be calling me. Apparently his grandparents are turning him away and are done with him. He wasn’t allowed at their home from 2020 on so I know the grandpa already didn’t want to take him before this. Nobody can get ahold of his father, and I’m sure my ex mother in law is helping him dodge and making excuses for him. I tried to talk to cps as briefly and privately as possible during my shift. I told her he is not able to come to stay with me, because I live with two people he attempted to murder and one he sexually abused, and that their safety is a non negotiable for me. 

[note: this will be a long rant. I am very upset but it’s a vent]
The cps worker is the most confrontational and unpleasant person, and I dread having to interact with her in any way. If I have asked her to repeat something over the phone while driving to work or in a spotty reception space (it’s only happened twice and she was aware of why), she is basically yelling at me, and she seems excited to have an excuse to be aggressive. She came to my house and immediately was cruel. She mocked my sister and I and shows zero empathy for what my daughter said, even after repeating the incidents of sexual abuse. She said “if daughter does something will you just toss her aside as well?” I said “she doesn’t live with someone she abused or tried to kill. Her response was “this isn’t about her, she’s not an excuse!” I got up and got coffee so I didn’t scream. It IS about her! That’s the reason he can’t be here! She laughed in my face and made a show of writing something down, when I told her that they should seek my son’s other family and that my daughter doesn’t have other family. She said my son hasn’t improved, he fails everything and associates with gang members, and all of this is because of me, yes including the attempted fucking murder, and he’s just a little boy. It’s “so sad everyone is giving up” despite me saying I’ll pay for him to get help. She isn’t even callus, she’s too emotionally aggressive to be called that. She does not care about following up with any facts and she seems committed to not hearing me. I stopped answering her when it was clear her intent was simply to bully me (into taking him? I’m not sure anymore). She left without interviewing anyone else and stating that “we could pull her, where do you think she should go if so” about my daughter.

I am devastated. My daughter is leverage to this rabid animal. Everything is ignored. She seems to actively be trying to paint me as unfit and the reason for my son’s behavior, and me saying I won’t budge means I should be punished and lose her. Nobody has gotten ahold of his father but she says I’m neglecting my son. I have stated I am willing to pay for his care and mental help. She reacts like I’m a monster.

Despite the entire arson case moving this slowly, she’s managed to make us a court case for Wednesday, within a week of him leaving their home. My daughter will be at school during the hearing, and she has a meeting with her school counselor that day. I am so worried I will say goodbye and she won’t come home from school. I think about her birthday party, her eye doctor appointment, the therapist waitlist, the vacation we were planning and cry because what can I even plan for now.

Thank you to everyone who helped me feel not so crazy and lost before.","oğlum neredeyse bir yıldır burada ve olaydan beri onunla hiçbir iletişimimiz olmadı, babasıyla yaklaşık bir ay geçirdi ve son dokuz aydır babaanne ve dedesinin yanına taşındı denetim görevlisi ve mahkemelerle iletişim halindeyim kundaklama davası ilerledikçe uyuşturucu testi, terapi yapacak ve büyükanne ve büyükbabası barınak, yemek, giyim ve okul sağlayan bir tür vasi olmak için gönüllü oldular, yasal olarak başı derde girerse herhangi bir mali sorumluluk almak istemedikleri için gerçek bir vasilik üstlenmeyi reddediyorlar ben de istemiyorum ama bunu adil buluyorum ve onların tutumlarına karşı hiçbir şeyim yok

bir eve taşındık ve kızım ve ben, o bizimleyken mümkün olmayan veya en azından mümkün hissedebileceğimiz kadar kolay olmayan bir hayat yaşıyoruz, o hala ayakta tedavi terapisti için bekleme listesinde ama hala okul danışmanına gidiyoruz ve bu arada yapabileceği her şeyi konuşuyoruz, olumsuz duygulardan bahsediyor, bazen kardeşiyle ilgili incinme ve kafa karışıklığından bahsediyor kesinlikle bir terapiste ihtiyacı var ve bir terapiste gideceğiz ama o sosyal olarak gelişen ve başarılı olan tatlı ve sevgi dolu bir kız akademik olarak sıfır davranışsal sorunla ona karşı üzülüyorum ve o hayatımın mutlak ışığı

hafta hoş başladı, bir gün okuldan kaçtık, genelde okula gitmez, yemin ederim katılımı için bir ödül partisi aldı ve disneyland'a gittik bu hafta doğum günü için davetiyeleri gönderdim ve hatta kendimi çok iyi hissettim, bir iki kaçamak yemek yedim

cuma günü işteyken bir sesli mesaj aldım, polisti, oğlumun o sırada onların gözetiminde olduğunu ve çocuk koruma görevlilerinin beni arayacağını söylediler, görünüşe göre büyükanne ve büyükbabası onu geri çeviriyor ve onunla işleri bitti, o zamandan beri evlerine girmesine izin verilmedi, bu yüzden büyükbabanın onu daha önce almak istemediğini biliyorum, kimse babasına ulaşamıyor ve eminim eski kayınvalidem onun kaçmasına yardım ediyor ve onun için bahaneler üretiyor, vardiyam sırasında çocuk koruma görevlileriyle olabildiğince kısa ve özel olarak konuşmaya çalıştım, ona benimle kalamayacağını çünkü iki kişiyle yaşadığımı, öldürmeye çalıştığını ve birini cinsel taciz ettiğini ve onların güvenliğinin benim için pazarlık konusu olmadığını söyledim

not bu uzun bir sitem olacak çok üzgünüm ama bu bir öfke patlaması
CPS çalışanı en çatışmacı ve nahoş kişi ve işe giderken veya düzensiz bir resepsiyon alanında telefonda bir şeyi tekrarlamasını istersem onunla herhangi bir şekilde etkileşime girmekten korkuyorum sadece iki kez oldu ve bana neden bağırdığının farkındaydı ve saldırgan olmak için bir bahanesi olduğu için heyecanlı görünüyor evime geldi ve hemen zalimce davrandı kız kardeşimle ve benimle alay etti ve kızımın söylediklerine karşı sıfır empati gösterdi cinsel taciz olaylarını tekrarladıktan sonra bile kızım bir şey yaparsa onu da bir kenara mı atacaksın dedi taciz ettiği veya öldürmeye çalıştığı biriyle yaşamadığını söyledim cevabı bu onunla ilgili değildi o bir bahane değildi kalktım kahve aldım bu yüzden bağırmadım onunla ilgiliydi bu yüzden burada olamazdı yüzüme güldü ve oğlumun diğer ailesini aramaları gerektiğini ve kızımın başka bir ailesi olmadığını söylediğimde bir şeyler yazıyormuş gibi yaptı oğlumun gelişmediğini her şeyde başarısız olduğunu söyledi ve çete üyeleriyle ilişki kuruyor ve bunların hepsi benim yüzümden evet buna cinayet girişimi de dahil ve o daha küçücük bir çocuk çok üzücü herkes pes ediyor yardım alması için ona para vereceğimi söylememe rağmen o duygusuz bile değil duygusal olarak çok agresif aranacak biri değil hiçbir gerçeği takip etmeyi umursamıyor ve beni dinlememeye kararlı görünüyor amacının sadece beni onu almaya zorlamak olduğu açık olduğunda ona cevap vermeyi bıraktım artık emin değilim başka kimseyi sorgulamadan ve onu çekebileceğimizi söylemeden gitti eğer öyleyse nereye gitmeli sence kızımla ilgili

yıkıldım kızım bu kuduz hayvana karşı bir kaldıraç her şey görmezden geliniyor beni aktif olarak uygunsuz göstermeye çalışıyor gibi görünüyor ve oğlumun davranışlarının sebebi ve benim kıpırdamayacağımı söylemem cezalandırılmam ve onu kaybetmem gerektiği anlamına geliyor kimse babasına ulaşamadı ama oğlumu ihmal ettiğimi söylüyor bakımı ve ruhsal yardımı için para ödemeye hazır olduğumu söyledim canavar gibi tepki veriyor

tüm kundaklama davasının bu kadar yavaş ilerlemesine rağmen bizi mahkemeye çıkarmayı başardı çarşamba evden ayrılmasından bir hafta sonra kızım duruşma sırasında okulda olacak ve o gün okul danışmanıyla bir görüşmesi olacak çok endişeliyim vedalaşacağım ve okuldan eve gelmeyecek doğum günü partisini düşünüyorum göz doktoru randevusunu terapist bekleme listesini planladığımız tatili düşünüyorum ve ağlıyorum çünkü artık ne planlayabilirim ki

"I really need to get it off my chest. I haven’t celebrated my birthday since my 12th birthday, and even then it was small. Cupcakes only. Maybe one kid from my class would actually show up. We stopped doing anything all (cakes/dinner/etc included) when I was 13 and my parents got divorced. We always celebrate my sisters, who are younger than me, but I’ve never had a real birthday party. The last few years no one even texts or calls to wish my happy birthday. Last year we celebrated my graduation, which was two days before my birthday. Not a single person said it, even on the day of. And every year I just keep my mouth shut and move on cause if they don’t talk about it, then they’ll just get annoyed if I bring it up. And I feel really guilty cause I want someone to do something nice for my birthday. Last year my friend brought me lunch to work and a small gift, and it was the first time anyone had ever done something like that, and I actually cried. I turn 22 this year and just… I want a cake. I want the get togethers. I want gifts. I sound so selfish, but I want that loved feeling I got last year and I want to be seen and loved. It hurts my feelings so much that the two friends I do have, my family, and even my coworkers of several years don’t even remember, but they’ll celebrate other’s without anyone saying anything. I’m trying not to cry today and I just feel so sad. 

I want to tell people, but I feel like bringing it up just makes me look desperate and self centered. Should I just let it go? It just a birthday, so should I just not say anything and let people move on or is it okay to talk about and bring up? ","Gerçekten içimden atmam gerek, doğum günümü 20. doğum günümden beri kutlamadım ve o zaman bile sadece küçük kekler yapardık, sınıfımdan sadece bir çocuk gelirdi, ben ve annem boşandığında hiçbir şey yapmayı bıraktık, pastalar, akşam yemekleri vs. dahil, benden küçük olan kız kardeşlerimle her zaman kutlama yaparız ama hiç gerçek bir doğum günü partisi yapmadım, son birkaç yıldır hiç kimse doğum günümü kutlamak için mesaj atmadı veya aramadı, geçen yıl mezuniyetimi kutladık, doğum günümden iki gün önceydi, tek bir kişi bile bunu söylemedi, her yıl o gün bile, sadece ağzımı kapalı tutuyorum ve devam ediyorum çünkü eğer bundan bahsetmezlerse ve konuyu açtığımda sinirleniyorlar ve kendimi çok suçlu hissediyorum çünkü birinin doğum günüm için güzel bir şey yapmasını istiyorum, geçen yıl arkadaşım bana işe öğle yemeği ve küçük bir hediye getirdi ve ilk kez biri böyle bir şey yapmıştı ve aslında ağladım, bu yıl dönüyorum ve sadece pasta istiyorum, bir araya gelmeler istiyorum, hediyeler istiyorum, çok bencilce geliyorum ama geçen yıl yaşadığım o sevgi dolu hissi istiyorum ve görülmek ve sevilmek istiyorum duygularımı çok incitiyor ki sahip olduğum iki arkadaşım, ailem ve hatta birkaç yıldır birlikte olduğum iş arkadaşlarım bile hatırlamıyorlar ama onlar hiç kimse bir şey söylemeden başkalarını kutluyorlar bugün ağlamamaya çalışıyorum ve kendimi çok üzgün hissediyorum

insanlara söylemek istiyorum ama bunu gündeme getirmek beni sadece çaresiz ve bencil gösteriyor bunu boş mu bırakmalıyım sadece doğum günü bu yüzden hiçbir şey söylemeyip insanların hayatına devam etmesine izin mi vermeliyim yoksa konuşup gündeme getirmek sorun olur mu"

"throwaway account, english isn’t my first language


I (16F) share a room with my sister (20F) because our house is small, and our beds are across from each other. Every night and morning, she touches herself even though she knows I’m awake. This morning she did it again, three times, and it literally made me throw up, why would she do this if she knows I’m in the room? She doesn’t even try to hide it, she keeps doing it right under the covers. At first, I thought maybe she wasn’t actually doing it because I didn’t think she would with me in the room. But I can clearly hear it, especially since she wears a belly chain, which makes it even more noticeable. Now every time i hear a belly chain i get scared and feel like i’m about to cry bc i don’t want her to do it. Sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to cry, and this morning I threw up because I felt disgusted. I occasionally sleep on the couch in the living room to avoid hearing her, but it’s really small and the heating doesn’t work in the living room. I’m too embarrassed to talk to my parents, who are also pretty close-minded, and I can’t keep sleeping on the couch forever, but we don’t have any other bedrooms. Please help me i don’t know what to do and i just keep crying and throwing up","tek kullanımlık hesap ingilizce benim ana dilim değil

"I don’t know if this is allowed, but I was at the gym tonight, at the time I go, there are only ever one or two people, if any at all. But again around the same time every night a couple comes in, a very athletic male and a female who is a little overweight and I can tell she’s very insecure with herself, I feel she has absolutely no reason to be. I am physically fit, and I wear pretty normal clothes to the gym. I really don’t pay much attention to others at all and try to stay out of areas other people are working out. I don’t wear a bra, I just never really have, they make it difficult to breathe and are just plain uncomfortable, I see them as unnecessary. 

Well tonight she walked up to me right after the two of them arrived and asked if I’d ever heard of Victorias Secret, I obviously said yeah, knowing what she might’ve been implying. Well she said that every time she sees me, I’m never wearing a bra, I said I don’t like them, she said well its weird and I said, I just don’t really care. As in, it doesn’t bother me. Then she walked away. 

This makes me feel unhappy because I try my best to not make others uncomfortable, sometimes even going out of my way to make sure others are comfortable. But I feel like I draw the line at making myself uncomfortable. 

Do you think I should suck it up and buy a bra for the gym? Or should I just try to ignore her feelings and continue doing what makes me comfortable? ","bunun izin verilip verilmediğini bilmiyorum ama bu gece spor salonundaydım gittiğimde orada sadece bir veya iki kişi oluyordu ama yine de her gece aynı saatlerde bir çift geliyordu çok atletik bir erkek ve biraz kilolu bir kadın ve kendine güvenmediği belli oluyor bunun için kesinlikle hiçbir sebebi olmadığını düşünüyorum fiziksel olarak formdayım ve spor salonuna oldukça normal kıyafetler giyiyorum başkalarına pek dikkat etmiyorum ve diğer insanların çalıştığı alanlardan uzak durmaya çalışıyorum sütyen takmıyorum sadece hiç takmıyorum nefes almayı zorlaştırıyorlar ve sadece rahatsız ediciler onları gereksiz görüyorum

bu gece ikisi geldikten hemen sonra yanıma geldi ve victorias secret'ı duyup duymadığımı sordu ben de ima ettiğini bildiğim için evet dedim her seferinde beni gördüğünde sütyen takmadığımı söyledi ben de sütyen takmadığımı söyledim o da garip dedi ben de umursamadığımı yani beni rahatsız etmediğini söyledim sonra da uzaklaştı

bu beni mutsuz ediyor çünkü bazen başkalarını rahatsız etmemek için elimden geleni yapıyorum başkalarının rahat olduğundan emin olmak için elimden geleni yapsam bile kendimi rahatsız etmemek için bir çizgi çektiğimi hissediyorum

"UPDATE- so i just got home from work and I haven’t heard anything. The police did come by and check but she wasn’t here. That’s all I can really do for now. There hasn’t been any missing persons reports that I know of. 

Yeah. I know title sounds like clickbait but I promise it’s not. 

So a few weeks ago, on new year’s day, I got home the same time my neighbor did. Later that night when I was taking my dog out I saw her boyfriend come in and get into the elevator. 

That same night there was a lot of arguing and it stopped eventually so I assumed they sorted it out. I then fell asleep and woke up the next morning to the girl (my neighbor) crying in the hallway. I didn’t think much of it, she was leaving for work and I thought she was just crying because of the argument with her boyfriend the night before.

A few days went by and I noticed that his car was still here, but I hadn’t seen him leave. That’s when I started getting a little suspicious. Fast forward to last wednesday my neighbor (the girl in question) started moving out of her apartment. While she was moving she had the door open and there was an absolute horrid stench coming from her apartment and filling the hallway. I’ve genuinely never smelled anything like it. And then on friday of last week, my roommate was in the elevator with her and apparently she was talking to herself and mumbling? weird but ok. 

Then last night there was a trail of a weird brown-ish liquid coming from her apartment to the elevator. There was a puddle of it in the elevator and it smelled like shit along with what looked like suitcase wheels going through it? I decided to call crime check and they told me I wasn’t the first one to call about it. ???? wtf? and then literally just tonight I found a grocery bag with clothes and some type of wire/ cord in it on the stairs. I also noticed that the boyfriend’s car was gone yesterday as well. 

I’m really confused and concerned. Maybe I just watch too much crime stuff so I can’t help but think she killed her boyfriend. I’m sure there’s probably a logical explanation for it all but with all the factors combined i can’t help but assume the worst. I would call for a welfare check but the problem is, shes only been here between 5-7pm at night. she gets her things and then leaves for the night and doesn’t come back until the next night. Is there anything else I can really do? Our landlord/ property management company knows about this as well. Apparently other tenants on our floor have complained.

ETA- Todays date is 1/23/24. I’ll update in the morning and I will update when I get more info. 

Edit: Bag of clothes and cord/wire here https://www.reddit.com/u/SpacelessMinds/s/GNoj3HG8rL

Weird liquid found in elevator here https://www.reddit.com/u/SpacelessMinds/s/0K5zutpiTN

**Edit 2- Apparently my roommate says the bag of clothes and the wire/cord have been in the stairwell for the last week. I took the stairs a few days ago when the stench was bad and didn’t notice anything. It is possible I missed it as it was in the corner. My roommate assumed it was from a homeless person. But in order to get into the stairwell you have to input a code that only the tenants know. She could still be right. Once you reach the second story of the stairwell, the walls open to a balcony. It’s possible a homeless person just threw it up there. I find it very unlikely though considering the bag was not tied and I found it in the corner perfectly. 

***Edit 3- Crime Check is my city’s non-emergency line. So yes I’ve called non emergency. 

****Edit 4- Called the police this morning before going to work and explained everything to them. I gave them the girls name and car info. They’re sending someone out but unfortunately I won’t be home. I’ll keep this updated and try to get more info.

evet, başlığın tıklama tuzağı gibi geldiğini biliyorum ama söz veriyorum öyle değil

birkaç hafta önce yılbaşı günü eve geldiğimde komşumla aynı saatte eve geldim, o gece köpeğimi dışarı çıkarırken erkek arkadaşının içeri girip asansöre bindiğini gördüm

aynı gece çok fazla tartışma oldu ve sonunda bitti, bu yüzden çözdüklerini varsaydım, sonra uyuyakaldım ve ertesi sabah komşumun kızının koridorda ağladığını duyarak uyandım, pek önemsemedim, işe gidiyordu ve bir önceki gece erkek arkadaşıyla yaşadığı tartışmadan dolayı ağladığını düşündüm

birkaç gün geçti ve arabasının hala burada olduğunu fark ettim ama onu görmemiştim, o zaman biraz şüphelenmeye başladım, geçen çarşambaya doğru ilerledim, söz konusu kız, taşınırken evinden taşınmaya başladı, kapısı açıktı ve orada dairesinden gelen ve koridoru dolduran kesinlikle korkunç bir koku vardı, gerçekten daha önce buna benzer bir şey koklamamıştım ve sonra geçen hafta cuma günü oda arkadaşım onunla asansördeydi ve görünüşe göre kendi kendine konuşuyor ve garip ama tamam mırıldanıyordu

sonra dün gece dairesinden asansöre garip kahverengimsi bir sıvı izi geldi asansörde bir su birikintisi vardı ve bok gibi kokuyordu ve içinden bavul tekerlekleri gibi görünen bir şey geçiyordu suç bürosunu aramaya karar verdim ve bana bunu ilk arayan kişinin ben olmadığımı söylediler wtf ve sonra tam bu gece merdivenlerde içinde kıyafetler ve bir tür kablo bulunan bir market poşeti buldum ayrıca erkek arkadaşının arabasının dün de gittiğini fark ettim

gerçekten kafam karıştı ve endişelendim belki de çok fazla suç filmi izliyorum bu yüzden erkek arkadaşını öldürdüğünü düşünmekten kendimi alamıyorum eminim bunun için mantıklı bir açıklama vardır ama tüm faktörler bir araya gelince en kötüsünü varsaymaktan kendimi alamıyorum bir sosyal yardım bürosu arardım ama sorun şu ki o sadece gecenin 12'sinde buradaydı eşyalarını alıp sonra gidiyor gece ve bir sonraki geceye kadar geri gelmiyor gerçekten yapabileceğim başka bir şey var mı ev sahibimizin emlak yönetim şirketi de bunu biliyor görünüşe göre katımızdaki diğer kiracılar şikayette bulunmuş

"I just finished Dental School, now my husband wants me to be a stay at home mom.

I (26f) just finished dental school. I spent 8 years of my life working my ass off to do the job of my dreams. My husband (28m) and I have been married 5 years, but have been together since we were 17 and 19. 

We’ve talked about children many times, and what childcare would look like with them. We BOTH agreed on daycare once they were 2 and private school once they reach school age. I’ve expressed that though I think stay at home moms are literal superhero’s, it’s not something that I’m interested in. I’m a very career driven woman and the thought of taking care of 4 (yes, we want 4) kids all day every day with literally no break and not being financially independent does not sound appealing to me. I told him he was welcome to be a stay at home dad if he wanted someone to stay at home with our children, and the conversation ended there. This was YEARS ago. I thought we were on the same page, and I made my wishes clear. 

Well, I graduated Dental School about a year ago now, and I work at my dream office. I genuinely couldn’t be happier to be doing what I’ve dreamed of since I was a little girl, and something I’ve spent blood (literally, I’ve been stabbed with so many needles it’s crazy), sweat, and tears achieving. 

My husband and I are finally in a place where we want to start trying for our first baby. We’re both so ready to be parents. The topic of childcare came back up again when my husband said “Are you gonna be okay quitting your job though?” Thinking he was talking about maternity leave and was just confused, I said “No babe you don’t quit your job for that, you just take leave for a few months.” 

He looked at me like I was stupid and said “no, I’m talking about you staying at home with the kids.” I was FLABBERGASTED. I couldn’t help but laugh, which I think set him off. He said “Our kids need a present mom, Alyssa.” 

I corrected him and told him that a working mom does not mean that she’s not a present one, and that I will not be staying at home with our kids. I said I didn’t go through 8 years of school to just never use my degree. Besides, it doesn’t even make sense for ME to quit my job when I made over double his salary.

Now he’s saying I’m an asshole and a bad wife and mom if I don’t quit my job when we have a baby to be fully present with them. I didn’t think I was, but now I’m not sure. I grew up with a stay at home mom and I loved it, so I don’t really have any grounds to talk about what it’s like having a working mom. I still don’t think working as a mom will make me a bad one, or a bad wife. Honestly I can’t help but think it’s because now that I’m out of school, I make so much more than him and it may have caused an insecurity? Idk. I just need advice guys.

çocuklar ve onlarla çocuk bakımı hakkında birçok kez konuştuk ikimiz de onlar büyüdüklerinde kreş ve okul çağına geldiklerinde özel okul konusunda anlaştık evde kalan annelerin gerçek süper kahramanlar olduğunu düşünmeme rağmen bunun ilgimi çeken bir şey olmadığını ifade ettim ben kariyer odaklı bir kadınım ve evet çocuklarla her gün, kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiç ara vermeden ilgilenmek istiyoruz ve maddi olarak bağımsız olmamak bana çekici gelmiyor ona evde kalan bir baba olmak isterse hoş karşılanacağını söyledim ve konuşma orada sona erdi bu yıllar önceydi aynı fikirde olduğumuzu düşünmüştüm ve isteklerimi açıkça belirttim

diş hekimliği okulundan yaklaşık bir yıl önce mezun oldum ve hayalimdeki ofiste çalışıyorum hayal ettiğim şeyi yapmaktan gerçekten daha mutlu olamazdım küçük bir kız olduğumdan beri ve bir şey için kan harcadım kelimenin tam anlamıyla çok sayıda iğneyle bıçaklandım, çılgınca ter ve gözyaşları elde ettim

kocam ve ben sonunda ilk bebeğimiz için denemeye başlamak istediğimiz bir noktadayız ikimiz de ebeveyn olmaya çok hazırdık çocuk bakımı konusu kocam işini bırakmayı kabul edecek misin diye sorduğunda tekrar gündeme geldi doğum izninden bahsettiğini düşünüyordum ve sadece kafası karışmıştı hayır bebeğim bunun için işini bırakmayacaksın sadece birkaç ay izin al dedim

bana aptalmışım gibi baktı ve hayır dedi çocuklarla evde kalmandan bahsediyorum şaşkına dönmüştüm gülmeden edemedim sanırım bu onu kızdırdı dedi çocuklarımızın hediye bir anneye ihtiyacı var alyssa

onu düzelttim ve çalışan bir anne olmanın hediye olmadığı anlamına gelmediğini ve çocuklarımızla evde kalmayacağımı söyledim yıllarca okula gitmediğimi sadece diplomamı kullanmadığımı söyledim ayrıca maaşının iki katından fazlasını kazandığımda işimden ayrılmam mantıklı değil

şimdi o Ben bir pislik ve kötü bir eş ve anneyim, eğer bir bebeğimiz olduğunda onlarla tam anlamıyla ilgilenmek için işimi bırakmazsam öyle olduğumu düşünmüyordum ama şimdi emin değilim, evde kalan bir anne olarak büyüdüm ve bunu çok sevdim bu yüzden çalışan bir anne olmanın nasıl bir şey olduğu hakkında konuşacak bir şeyim yok, hala anne olarak çalışmanın beni kötü bir anne veya kötü bir eş yapacağını düşünmüyorum dürüst olmak gerekirse bunun nedeninin artık okuldan mezun olmam ve ondan çok daha fazla para kazanmam olduğunu ve bunun bende güvensizlik yaratmış olabileceğini düşünüyorum, bilmiyorum sadece tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var beyler"
"So, yeah, this is a throwaway because WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL!?

So first, not strictly incestuous, my family tree has got many branches.

So my Mother had my sister Becky (fake name) with her *high school sweetheart*, before her relationship with my Dad. Becky lived with my Mothers parents for a long time, pretty much from her birth until I was about 3 years old. My Mothers and Dads relationship had broken down by the time I was 1 so he was out of the picture. Becky and my Dad share no blood, but he met her as a child many times. He was dating her Mother, he has been in her life, even if it was only because of me...

Allegedly, the story goes that last year at a family get together, they started talking and he saw her as the **adult she was and not the child he knew** (I WANT THE GROUND TO SWALLOW ME WHOLE!). They kept their relationship secret. And have been ""exclusive"" for a few months. They decided to tell everyone when they couldn't hide Becky's pregnancy any more (she is 4ish months pregnant and not showing). So now, I am going to have a sister/niece or brother/nephew (is that how this works)... and I have to be ok with this?!

My Mother doesn't seem to fucking care!? She just keeps saying Becky is an adult. I told my Dad I think he is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy overstepping some quite obvious boundaries. I don't want to think of my Dad as being a predator, but I don't understand how he can separate the child from the adult?!

Not to mention the 20+ year age gap. I know its cool for some, but they are not on equal levels.

I don't know what Becky's Dad thinks about this because as far as I am aware he hasn't been in the picture for a while. My Grandpa has passed, but Grandma seems to see no issues with it, because Dad never really acted like Becky's Dad.

Am I blowing this out of proportion!? This is weird? Why is no one else shocked?! I honestly think I am angry. I just need some perspective.

**EDIT:** Firstly, please can I say thank you to some of the really nice people in the comments, it has helped greatly keep my sanity in the past 24ish hours. It was a lot of information for a Monday morning. My Dad dipped almost immediately after his announcement, I have messaged him and told him I do not want to see him, until I am ready to see him. As for my sister - she is delusional. I will update further later on, I have finished school for the summer so I have taken longer shifts at work and need to get going.

Some people were worried that I didn't have anyone to talk to in real life. That is true in some ways, but I do have a ""trusted adult"" outside of my fucked up family. I have been at my job for about 2 years and my boss is a really nice woman. I have actually been to her house and baby sat her kids (don't worry, I wont be letting my Dad near them) and I told her about all of this, she wants to have a real talk with me today when I get in.

To the people who said this wasn't real. Unfortunately, it is. I would not wish this feeling on anyone.

**EDIT:** I have posted a update [here ](https://www.reddit.com/user/Calm-Huckleberry-375/comments/1dufhll/update_my_f17_dad_m45_has_gotten_my_sister_f23/)","yani evet bu bir çöp çünkü gerçekte ne cehennem

yani ilk olarak kesinlikle ensest değil aile ağacımın birçok dalı var

yani annem kız kardeşim becky'nin sahte adını, babamla ilişkisinden önce lise sevgilisiyle birlikte kullandı becky, doğumundan ben yaklaşık 4,5 yaşına kadar annemin ailesiyle uzun süre yaşadı annemle babamın ilişkisi ben doğduğumda bozulmuştu bu yüzden o artık resimden çıkmıştı becky ve babamın kan bağı yok ama onunla çocukken birçok kez tanışmıştı annesiyle çıkıyordu hayatındaydı, sadece benim yüzümden olsa bile

iddiaya göre hikaye geçen yıl bir aile toplantısında konuşmaya başlamışlar ve onu tanıdığı çocuk değil yetişkin olarak görmüş yerin dibine girmek istiyorum ilişkilerini gizli tutmuşlar ve birkaç aydır özel hayatları varmış becky'nin hamileliğini artık gizleyemeyeceklerini herkese söylemeye karar vermişler becky yaklaşık 3 aylık hamile ve belli etmiyor bu yüzden şimdi bir kız kardeşim yeğenim veya erkek kardeşim olacak işler böyle mi yürüyor ve bununla barışık olmalıyım bu

annem umursamıyor gibi görünüyor, sadece becky'nin yetişkin olduğunu söyleyip duruyor, babama bence çok çok çok belli sınırları aştığını söyledim, babamı bir avcı olarak düşünmek istemiyorum ama çocuğu yetişkinden nasıl ayırabildiğini anlamıyorum

yaş farkından bahsetmiyorum bile, bazıları için harika olduğunu biliyorum ama eşit seviyede değiller

becky'nin babasının bu konuda ne düşündüğünü bilmiyorum çünkü bildiğim kadarıyla bir süredir ortalıkta yok, büyükbabam vefat etti ama büyükannem bununla ilgili bir sorun görmüyor çünkü baba hiçbir zaman becky'nin babası gibi davranmadı

bunu abartıyor muyum? bu garip, neden başka kimse şok olmuyor, dürüst olmak gerekirse öfkeli olduğumu düşünüyorum, sadece biraz bakış açısına ihtiyacım var

düzenleme öncelikle lütfen yorumlardaki gerçekten iyi insanlara teşekkür edebilir miyim? son birkaç saatte akıl sağlığımı korumama çok yardımcı oldu, pazartesi sabahı için çok fazla bilgiydi, babam duyurusundan hemen sonra çöktü, ona mesaj attım ve onu görmek istemediğimi söyledim onu görmeye hazırım çünkü kız kardeşim sanrılı, daha sonra daha fazla bilgi vereceğim yaz için okulu bitirdim bu yüzden işte daha uzun vardiyalarda çalışıyorum ve gitmem gerekiyor

bazı insanlar gerçek hayatta konuşacak kimsem olmadığı için endişelendiler bu bir bakıma doğru ama berbat ailemin dışında güvendiğim bir yetişkin var yaklaşık yıldır işimde çalışıyorum ve patronum gerçekten iyi bir kadın evine gittim ve çocuklarına baktım endişelenmeyin babamın onlara yaklaşmasına izin vermeyeceğim ve ona tüm bunları anlattım bugün eve geldiğimde benimle gerçek bir konuşma yapmak istiyor

bunun gerçek olmadığını söyleyen insanlara maalesef gerçek bu hissi kimsenin yaşamasını istemem

"Update at bottom.
This happened 2 days ago and I'm still a bit shook up about the whole situation and not sure what caused it.

 So for context, I (22f) have a brother (24m), for the sake of this post I will call him Mike. Mike and I have never really gotten along growing up, and he had gone to prison for 5 years when I was 17 and just got out last year. It was probably the longest me and him ever went without arguing about something.

On Sunday my brother came over to my grandmothers house (I had been living here with my husband and children to help take care of my grandma since she's dealing with Alzheimer's) and I was in the kitchen making a pizza since I had just woken up. My husband woke up about an hour or so before I did and had already gone upstairs into the kitchen and spoke with my father and mother (information I didn't know until after everything had happened). While I was in the kitchen cutting the pizza my brother called me from the living room. I told my son (4yo) to go see what he wanted and to get me if it was important. My son went into the living room to ask my brother what he needed and came to tell me that he just needed to talk to me.

I went into the living room and was met immediately with yelling and screaming. I had only been awake for 20 minutes by this point, so I was super confused and I asked him what he was talking about because I had no knowledge about any previous conversations that had taken place in the house. He was yelling about my husband not helping my father out with yard work (my husband had injured his shoulder at work a couple days prior.) I asked Mike what he was talking about because I didn't know anything and he just got into my face and started screaming that I needed to get out of the house because all I was doing was taking advantage of our family.

 I left the living room and went into the family room where my 3 children (4, 1, and 2 months) were and told my oldest to go downstairs into the basement. When I turned to get my 1 yo daughter, my brother had followed me into the family room and was only inches away from my face and was screaming. I was put into a ptsd attack because of how he was acting (I had been diagnosed with ptsd 3 years prior due to an abusive relationship I was in). I pushed him to get him away from me so I could get my daughter and 2 month old son to take them away from the screaming. As soon as I turned to start walking towards my baby (who had started crying due to the noise) he grabbed the back of my neck and started punching me until I fell down to my knees.

I ran to get my husband and told him what was happening. My husband was outside on the phone with his father because we were supposed to go over to his house to pick up something we left over there. My brother followed me outside and started screaming again and things kept escalating. He threatened to kill my husband, and when I heard that I ran inside and grabbed my phone which was on the table next to the playpen I had my baby laying in. I immediately called the police and took my other children downstairs. 

In the basement, we have a tv and a ps5, so my husband put on a Spider-Man game for my 4yo to play while I talked to the police. After the police talked to everyone and got statements, my brother was attested since he left a giant bruise on my neck where he had hit me. My dad thinks I should drop the charges because my brother was out of prison in god behavior and could be sent back for the rest of his sentence which would be a 6 year term. I told my husband that I will not drop the charges against him since it wasn't the first time he's ever hit me and I refuse to let him keep doing it.

My entire family is really torn about the whole situation, and my uncle (who was there when it happened) bailed my brother out of jail. I am still messed up about it since it all happened so quickly and I didn't even know why my brother was upset in the first place. My dad has been acting really cold to me since I won't drop the charges and I'm starting to feel like I may be going a bit too far by pressing charges. I don't know what to do. My dad has talked to me about me moving out of my grandmothers house since it happened and I don't know what to do. Should I go ahead with pressing charges?

UPDATE:
Thank all of you for the advice. I talked with my husband about everything and he agreed that we should get a protection order as well. To answer a few questions I saw in the comments, my grandmother owns her house but her will is set up as a trust so once she passes the house will be sold and the money split evenly between her 3 kids (my dad, uncle, and aunt). I told my parents I was concerned about the condition of my grandmother because my uncle's health had been declining and he can no longer cook for her which is why we moved in to help in the first place. Since I moved in I had been the primary cook in the house making sure my grandmother has healthy meals. We were planning on buying a house next summer, but since everything has happened we have moved up our move out date and will be buying a house before Christmas this year. Me and my husband will be paying for a nurse to come check on my grandmother because I am still concerned about her health and worried that when I'm not there no one else will put in the effort to care for her properly. I really appreciate all the advice given and definitely will continue to press charges against my brother. Thank you all for the comments.","update at bottom
this happened  days ago and im still a bit shook up about the whole situation and not sure what caused it

 so for context i f have a brother m for the sake of this post i will call him mike mike and i have never really gotten along growing up and he had gone to prison for  years when i was  and just got out last year it was probably the longest me and him ever went without arguing about something

on sunday my brother came over to my grandmothers house i had been living here with my husband and children to help take care of my grandma since shes dealing with alzheimers and i was in the kitchen making a pizza since i had just woken up my husband woke up about an hour or so before i did and had already gone upstairs into the kitchen and spoke with my father and mother information i didnt know until after everything had happened while i was in the kitchen cutting the pizza my brother called me from the living room i told my son yo to go see what he wanted and to get me if it was important my son went into the living room to ask my brother what he needed and came to tell me that he just needed to talk to me

i went into the living room and was met immediately with yelling and screaming i had only been awake for  minutes by this point so i was super confused and i asked him what he was talking about because i had no knowledge about any previous conversations that had taken place in the house he was yelling about my husband not helping my father out with yard work my husband had injured his shoulder at work a couple days prior i asked mike what he was talking about because i didnt know anything and he just got into my face and started screaming that i needed to get out of the house because all i was doing was taking advantage of our family

 i left the living room and went into the family room where my  children   and  months were and told my oldest to go downstairs into the basement when i turned to get my  yo daughter my brother had followed me into the family room and was only inches away from my face and was screaming i was put into a ptsd attack because of how he was acting i had been diagnosed with ptsd  years prior due to an abusive relationship i was in i pushed him to get him away from me so i could get my daughter and  month old son to take them away from the screaming as soon as i turned to start walking towards my baby who had started crying due to the noise he grabbed the back of my neck and started punching me until i fell down to my knees

i ran to get my husband and told him what was happening my husband was outside on the phone with his father because we were supposed to go over to his house to pick up something we left over there my brother followed me outside and started screaming again and things kept escalating he threatened to kill my husband and when i heard that i ran inside and grabbed my phone which was on the table next to the playpen i had my baby laying in i immediately called the police and took my other children downstairs 

in the basement we have a tv and a ps so my husband put on a spiderman game for my yo to play while i talked to the police after the police talked to everyone and got statements my brother was attested since he left a giant bruise on my neck where he had hit me my dad thinks i should drop the charges because my brother was out of prison in god behavior and could be sent back for the rest of his sentence which would be a  year term i told my husband that i will not drop the charges against him since it wasnt the first time hes ever hit me and i refuse to let him keep doing it

my entire family is really torn about the whole situation and my uncle who was there when it happened bailed my brother out of jail i am still messed up about it since it all happened so quickly and i didnt even know why my brother was upset in the first place my dad has been acting really cold to me since i wont drop the charges and im starting to feel like i may be going a bit too far by pressing charges i dont know what to do my dad has talked to me about me moving out of my grandmothers house since it happened and i dont know what to do should i go ahead with pressing charges

"Please read this before you comment. I am a (f42) English teacher who teaches at an alternative school. For obviously reasons I will be keeping the students name, my name; as well as my schools name out of this post. 

If you aren’t aware of what an alternative school is it’s basically a school that kids come to when they don’t do well at other schools. This can be for a multitude of reasons, such as drugs, grades, bullying, or just overall not being able to function in a normal school setting.

Before she joined our school all of the staff who would be teaching her had a meeting with our principal and the principal of her previous high school. He let us know why she was removed from her other high school, a long story short she got removed because she put one of her peers into the hospital.

Fast forward to school starting I don't have this girl in my class until the second semester of the year which started in January. When I see her, I automatically knew it was her. She just had a completely different energy than the other students who come to our school, she was confident, her peers respected her. She was quiet, although many people tried to talk to her she would kind of give them a look, nod at what they were saying, and just go back to her work. I very quickly found out that this girl was a borderline genius. She was one of the smartest students I've ever taught, and I should know this, considering I usually teach seniors in their English class, this girl was only a sophomore and in the same class. 

At this point, I had kind of forgotten about the meeting that we had had in regards to her past highschool and when someone had brought it up to me I just couldn't believe that this was the same girl and it was surely a misunderstanding however, this week everything changed. 

She came into class and you could immediately tell something was different. All of my students were scared and I'm not talking they were nervous or waiting for something to happen. I mean everyone came in they put their heads down and were quiet which is highly unusual. She came in about 10 minutes late, I told her she was 10 minutes late and asked where she was. She looked me dead in the face, scoffed at me, and then went and sat down.  As a teacher who is responsible for disciplining students I obviously walked over to her and asked her what was wrong? Why are you being disrespectful? And basically just trying to get a relative of what was going on in the school. 

 She didn't answer me just kind of stared at me while I talked to her and I'm going to be so honest with you guys; The look in her eyes made me a 42-year-old woman who has been teaching for almost 15 years afraid.  I was genuinely scared. The look in her eyes just gave me goosebumps. But this isn’t why I’m thinking about quitting. 

During my class right we’re doing a group project where the group gets to pick out a book and then kind of do a self-paced project. I had put her in a group with some people that I have seen she hung out with. She’s a relatively quiet person, but was being really playful and I could see that the group is off task. I walked over and told them to get back on task and kept redirecting them throughout the class. I got very annoyed at this at the end of the class I decided I was going to call her and tell her that I had wrote her up for being disrespectful to me and for distracting the rest of the class. She didn’t argue, she smiled at me. This was a uncomfortable situation. She smiled at me, said she understood, and then she walked out of class, this was on Monday.  She has been absent since this happened. 

Yesterday, which was Wednesday, I was at the grocery store around 6:30 p.m. everything was fine in the grocery store, and I’d honestly forgot about the encounter between me and this girl. Just as I was leaving the grocery store, I saw her. She wasn’t wearing her usual outfit of a T-shirt and pajama pants, she was wearing very loose pants with a shirt that have been cut right below her chest that had a hood attached to it and it was hard to tell it was her from far away, unless you knew her.  However, she was just standing outside the grocery store, staring at me. I kind of waved to her just to be polite. I wasn’t gonna go ask her why she had been absent and just figured she’d be back tomorrow, but as I’m pulling out of the grocery store, she still at the front staring at me watching me pull out. On my way home I was followed. I was followed by a black chargers with tinted windows; I took multiple turns away from my house; very complex turns and this car was definitely following me so I called the police.

I don’t know why, but after abt 15 minutes the car did a U-turn and pulled away. At this point I was shaking I’d called my husband and told them what happened and the cops told me that they would meet me at my house and get a description of the vehicle, and any suspicious features , on my way home I thought about the girl and I chalked it up to just a coincidence that she was there.

Today is Thursday it’s currently noon while I’m writing this I’m on my lunch break which is right after the class I have with her. She came into class after being absent all week and I had asked her where she’d been. She gave some vague answer about not feeling well and really just didn’t wanna have to deal with people in school; classic teenager answer, overall everything was relatively normal. She was reading her book, communicating with her group and then at one point she turns to me, looks me in the face and goes, “ Did you get home safe last night?”

She had never asked me this before or even remotely seem to care about my well-being. This was weird. I kind of gave her a look, and I told her that I got home fine and asked what she was doing at the grocery store by herself.  She gave me a half smile with her lips tucked in and went back talking to her group.  After that class I went down to go heat up my food just time to see her walking out the doors to the front of the school. As I was standing at the microwave, we got a very clear view of what was happening in front of the school since we have a very open concept with lots of windows. That’s when I noticed she was getting into a black charger.

I was watching her get into the car to see if I could see who was picking her up. When halfway through her opening the door, she stopped. She turned around, made eye contact contact with me through the window of the staff room, waved very slowly at me with a Terrifying look on her face. And when I say terrifying, I don’t mean she was making a scary face at me or like a monster I mean she had the most sinister smile that I have ever seen on her face then she got in the car.  I’m writing this debating on whether I should call the police or tell my principal or even tell anyone because I fear that I risk losing my job by accusing her of something like that when really, she hasn’t done anything wrong. That’s why I’m posting this here. 

Some kids at the school are associated with gangs and I just don’t know if I’ve put myself in danger. Can someone help me? What should I do? What are your opinions on the situation?

today is thursday its currently noon while im writing this im on my lunch break which isonunla birlikte olduğum dersten hemen sonra, bütün hafta boyunca yokluğunun ardından sınıfa geldi ve ona nerede olduğunu sordum, iyi hissetmediği ve okulda insanlarla uğraşmak istemediği konusunda belirsiz bir cevap verdi, klasik genç cevabı, genel olarak her şey nispeten normaldi, kitabını okuyordu ve grubuyla iletişim kuruyordu ve sonra bir noktada bana döndü, yüzüme baktı ve dedi ki dün gece eve sağ salim vardın mı

daha önce bana bunu hiç sormamıştı ve hatta uzaktan bile benim iyiliğimi umursamıyor gibiydi, bu garipti, ona bir bakış attım ve eve iyi geldiğimi söyledim ve market alışverişinde tek başına ne yaptığını sordum, dudaklarını büzerek bana yarım bir gülümseme verdi ve grubuyla konuşmaya geri döndü, o dersten sonra yemeğimi ısıtmak için aşağı indim, tam okulun önüne doğru yürüdüğünü görme zamanıydı, mikrodalganın önünde duruyordum, okulun önünde neler olduğunu çok net görebiliyorduk, çok sayıda pencerenin olduğu çok açık bir konseptimiz var, o zaman siyah bir şarj cihazına bindiğini fark ettim

arabaya binmesini izliyordum kapıyı açmasının yarısında durduğunda kimin aldığını görebiliyor muydum diye baktım, arkasını döndü, öğretmenler odasının penceresinden benimle göz teması kurdu, yüzünde korkutucu bir ifadeyle bana çok yavaşça el salladı ve korkutucu dediğimde bana korkutucu bir surat yaptığı veya bir canavar gibi davrandığı anlamına gelmiyor, yüzünde gördüğüm en uğursuz gülümseme vardı, sonra arabaya bindi, bunu polisi arayıp aramamam, müdüre söylemem veya herhangi birine söylemem konusunda tartışırken yazıyorum çünkü onu böyle bir şeyle suçlayarak işimi kaybetme riskiyle karşı karşıya kalmaktan korkuyorum, oysa aslında hiçbir yanlış yapmadı, bu yüzden bunu buraya yazıyorum

okuldaki bazı çocuklar çetelerle bağlantılı ve kendimi tehlikeye atıp atmadığımı bilmiyorum, biri bana yardım edebilir mi, ne yapmalıyım, durum hakkındaki görüşleriniz nelerdir"
"I (19F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been together for 3 years. We haven’t had any big problems or fights but he does not provide anything for me. He has no job, no car and didn’t graduate high school. I am beginning a medical program for my bachelors degree and make pretty decent money. But, all of it goes toward gas to take him places or food that I have to buy him. He recently tagged along for a family vacation where I paid 700 dollars on him. He never spent a dime on me. He’s never taken me out for a date and I am just tired of waiting around for him to change.

I just feel bad because we have no problems. We always have a good time together and have never had a fight about our relationship. I am starting to think that I should just called the relationship off.

"I'm 15f and my stepdad is openly perverted towards girls my age which unfortunately includes me. I came home from school today to change out of my school clothes and take my bra off and as i was getting dressed i saw that a video camera had been mounted to the wall facing Mr.

I went straight to my mom and told her and she said that my stepdad had installed it for safety reasons and that i shouldn't worry about it and that he isn't going to look at the camera footage unless something bad happens. I tried telling her that it's illegal and he has a recording of me undressing and she got angry at me for accusing him of having bad intentions.

From my prior experience with telling people at school about the times he's creeped on me I know its not going to help if I reported this to the school and I'm scared to go to the cops since I had a bad experience with police when I was younger.

How can I handle this since idk what else to do and I'll be in serious trouble if I break the camera so I feel like I'm out of options ","ben f ve üvey babam yaşıtlarımdaki kızlara karşı açıkça sapık ki ne yazık ki ben de dahilim bugün okuldan eve geldim okul kıyafetlerimi değiştirmek ve sutyenimi çıkarmak için ve giyinirken duvara monte edilmiş bir video kamera gördüm bay

"My best friend Sarah and her husband Matt are about two months away from having their first child, a baby girl. A few weeks ago they told me that they've decided on the name Dolly, after me. Now, Dolly is not my real name, but instead the nickname I've gone by for years, and basically everyone in my life knows me as such. Regardless, I am extremely flattered and super super excited for them.

However, I was first called Dolly by a middle school bully, for my (fairly large) boobs, just like Dolly Parton's. After a few years of hating being teased like this, right before my junior year of high school I kind of did a 180, and started to like it, so much so that for my senior year I stopped going by my real name (Allison) and started going by Dolly.

Sarah knows Dolly isn't my real name, but she doesn't know about the backstory of the nickname, because A. it's pretty embarrassing, and B. she's never asked, but I now feel morally obligated to help her avoid a naming mishap, because this is a HUMAN CHILD. 

What do I do? Is there any way for me to help her without revealing my secret? Should I just roll with it? Help!!!","en iyi arkadaşım sarah ve kocası matt ilk çocuklarına yaklaşık iki ay kala bir kız bebek doğuracaklar birkaç hafta önce bana dolly ismini koymaya karar verdiklerini söylediler şimdi dolly gerçek adım değil bunun yerine yıllardır kullandığım takma isim ve hayatımdaki herkes beni bu şekilde tanıyor, onlar için çok gururluyum ve çok çok heyecanlıyım

"My mum went out two days before christmas and then text me 12 hours later saying she would be gone for a week and for me to have the kids. She hasn’t come back since. So almost 9 weeks. I have heard from her 3 times total and she is saying she isn’t coming back any time soon, she just keeps sending money. 

My siblings are 16 13 12 9 and 7. I’m 19. 

I’m surviving looking after the kids by myself and tbh not much has changed because I did most of it when my mum was here anyway. We live with our nan but she doesn’t help with them really either, and my older siblings are long moved out.

I guess my question is, is my mum being gone a serious issue legally and with social services? I don’t want to risk the kids going into care (been there done that when I was younger) so I haven’t told anyone that she’s gone. I’m scared of what will happen if people find out so I don’t want to even ask the question irl","annem noelden iki gün önce dışarı çıktı ve sonra saatler sonra bana bir hafta boyunca uzakta olacağını ve çocuklarımla ilgilenmem gerektiğini söyleyen bir mesaj attı, o zamandan beri geri dönmedi, neredeyse haftalardır ondan haber alıyorum ve yakında geri dönmeyeceğini söylüyor, sadece para göndermeye devam ediyor

sanırım sorum şu, annemin gitmesi yasal olarak ve sosyal hizmetler açısından ciddi bir sorun mu, çocukların bakıma girmesini riske atmak istemiyorum, daha önce de böyle bir şey yaşadım, bu yüzden kimseye gittiğini söylemedim, insanlar öğrenirse ne olacağından korkuyorum, bu yüzden gerçek hayatta bile bu soruyu sormak istemiyorum"
"Hello - me (33F) &amp; my husband (42M) were married in May. Our wedding photographers were a husband wife team and they were awesome, incredible people. They brought so much creativity to our day and we were lucky to have them there. 

I'd been communicating mostly with the wife before the wedding - she's does their general admin. When our 6 week due date for the pictures arrived, I sent her message and heard nothing back. Tried an email and another text over a couple of weeks but still nothing. Started to worry - as they were really communicative. Even if just to say, we'll get back to you later. 

I then emailed her husband checking if everything was ok, only to find out that she had died from a short illness just a few weeks before. Its tragic - she was very young and they had 2 small kids. I sent him my condolences and said to take all the time he needs.

So - my question is (and I'm sorry if it sounds crass. I understand his whole world has been flipped upside down and everything must hurt right now and will for a long time), when could I contact him again to ask how things are going? 

I'm tempted to ask for the unedited files so we can just sort them out - my boss has photo editing software and has offered to help. But is that even appropriate? 

Just seeking a range of advice really.

"Throwaway account

The title pretty much says it all, but I’ve had a girlfriend a few years back who died in a car crash three years ago and I’d visit her grave from time to time for more than two years before I got my current girlfriend. I still talk to my previous girlfriends relatives. My current gf told me she felt a little uncomfortable to me still talking about my previous girlfriends relatives a few months ago but I brushed it off.

The other day, I went to visit her grave again (it’s been months since last time) and I cried a little because I’d talk to her grave about nothing and everything, about what’s going on in my life, what’s on my mind, etc, my current gf saw me on snap and immediately called me in my moment (she knows where the grave is because I took her there once) and freaked out on me. She told me to come home which I did.

When I got home she told me I was cheating on her, but her logic was clearly wrong which I pointed out and she made me sleep on the couch when I told her I was simply unloading myself because me and my past gf would unload each other’s baggage on each other. This was three days ago and she still gives me the cold shoulder when I try to talk to her. She doesn’t even respond to my texts, ove been trying to have a talk with her for two days and I’m worried because she hasn’t come home from work yet. Any advice?","tek kullanımlık hesap

Hala eski kız arkadaşımın akrabalarıyla konuşuyorum. Şu anki kız arkadaşım bana karşı biraz rahatsız hissettiğini söyledi. Birkaç ay önce hala eski kız arkadaşımın akrabalarından bahsediyordum ama önemsemedim

geçen gün tekrar mezarını ziyarete gittim. Son ziyaretimden bu yana aylar geçti ve biraz ağladım çünkü mezarıyla hayatımda olup biten her şey hakkında konuşuyordum. Aklımdan geçenler vs. Şu anki kız arkadaşım beni snap'te gördü ve hemen beni aradı. Mezarın nerede olduğunu biliyor çünkü onu bir keresinde oraya götürdüm ve bana çok kızdı. Eve gelmemi söyledi ve ben de öyle yaptım

eve gittiğimde beni aldattığımı söyledi ama mantığı açıkça yanlıştı. Bunu da belirttim ve ona sadece kendimi boşalttığımı söylediğimde beni kanepede uyuttu. Çünkü ben ve eski kız arkadaşım birbirimizin yüklerini boşaltacaktık. birbirimize bu üç gün önceydi ve ben onunla konuşmaya çalıştığımda bana hala soğuk davranıyor, mesajlarıma bile cevap vermiyor, iki gündür onunla konuşmaya çalışıyorum ve hala işten eve gelmediği için endişeliyim, herhangi bir tavsiyeniz var mı?"
"(Update part 2: electric boogaloo)
I have gotten so many supportive people. Many missed that I was a dad though lol Thank you for the awesome kind words. 
I gave him the option to have the day off. Figured he might need another day to sit with how he was feeling. He didn’t want to stay home because he just wanted to get the awkward moment of seeing her over with. I have verified she is blocked on everything. 
One kind person funded a trip to the theater to see the new Alien movie. Along with Godzilla and Rocky that’s his favorite series( good movie btw, go see it). That was awesome. 

I do think I have decided against bringing it to the parents attention, he thinks that could just make it worse and after some discussion with people here I agree. If she makes an issue at school i think that’s a different story

Thank you,
From one dad trying his best. 

(Update) Thank you for the kindness. Eventually he wanted to talk. She made him feel creepy for asking what was going on while she was with a group of her friends. 
I hugged him while he asked me what was wrong with him. 

That was the hardest thing to hear. After a while I was able to make him laugh a bit and he kicked my ass in Mortal Kombat 11 for a few hours.

I’ll be speaking to her parents today. I’d want to know if my son treated their daughter like this. 

Once again, thank you from a single dad who has no damn idea what he’s doing. 


My son is about to go to his first homecoming dance. He’s 17, late bloomer so his experience with girls is limited. 
I found out about an hour ago that the girl my son is going with has ghosted him all week. Won’t respond to messages. Ignores him at school. He still wants to go to figure things out.
I’m pretty sure this was her way of telling him she didn’t like him anymore. 

The look on his face right now is the most crushing thing I have ever seen. I’m 42 years old and I’m ready to bawl my eyes out. 

I know my son is about to have a very bad night. He still wants to go. He hasn’t lost home.

Any advice on how I can handle this? He’s a sensitive kid and this is gonna do some damage, I think.

"I need advice because I’m shaking with anger and embarrassment right now. My now ex-boyfriend (24M) and I (20F) have been together for over a year, and for the most part, everything has been great. We’re close, we trust each other, and our sex life has always been pretty healthy… or so I thought.

Yesterday, after we had sex, I went to use his phone to look something up (with his permission, of course). When I opened the browser, his recent search history was right there, and I saw *""Why is my girlfriend so loose?""* staring back at me.

I cannot even begin to describe how hurt and furious I am. Like, seriously?? Is this what he’s been thinking about while we’re being intimate? I feel completely humiliated. I’ve never been insecure about my body or sex before, but now I can’t stop thinking about it. All these questions are swirling in my head: Has he been feeling this way for a while? Does he think there’s something wrong with me? Why hasn’t he talked to me about it directly if this is how he feels?

Part of me wants to scream at him for making me feel like this. Part of me wants to crawl into a hole and never bring it up because I feel so embarrassed. I have no idea how to even start this conversation with him. What do I say? How do I confront him without either losing my cool or just breaking down?

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? How do you handle something so personal without it blowing up? Because right now, I don’t know if I can look at him the same way after seeing that.","tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var çünkü şu anda öfke ve utançtan titriyorum eski sevgilim m ve ben bir yıldan fazla bir süredir birlikteyiz ve çoğunlukla her şey harikaydı yakındık birbirimize güveniyoruz ve seks hayatımız her zaman oldukça sağlıklıydı ya da ben öyle düşünüyordum

"I (17M) go to a boarding high school. Last night my roomate (16M) started masturbating in his bed around midnight. I heard it from my bed and sat up to tell him to stop. To my horror I realized he wasn't doing it under the bed. He was above the covers masturbating. He was clearly watching porn and therefore his side of the room was illuminated. I saw a lot more than I wanted to and immediately flipped over and just tried to ignore it. It lasted a long time and was very loud (lots of lotion and loud breathing). I'm a senior and I only have 30 more days until graduation. I really don't want to have to move rooms so close to graduation but I also feel really uncomfortable with this situation. What should I do?

Edit: I'm going to put ghost pepper hot sauce in his lotion bottle. Probably tonight. I will update with what comes of this.

Edit: after much thought and consideration for his health, and my legal security. I decided against the pepper sauce in the lotion route and instead discussed it with my TAC officer (adult in charge). Ultimately this resulted in him being moved out of my room. So now I have my own room.

I tried contacting her friend cause I didn't want to believe it but she said that she wasn't with her at all.

I feel calm right now. But I am pissed. How could she do this to me. I've always been there for her. I get that long distance is difficult but at least be brave enough to break it up. I'm honestly not sure what I should do. She probably already know that I know. I don't know how I should confront her.


Edit: I am going to dump her. The bitch is out of my life. I just don't know how much I should say when I confront her. I'm more worried about making a fool of myself or giving her some semblance of power over me. Sorry if that wasn't clear in the post.

"For starters, I’m a 20 yo guy, and twice now when making out with my girlfriend of almost 4 months, I’ve came in my pants. Not precum, but a full on orgasm. Unsurprisingly, I’d rather not be making my pants sticky all the time.

I do check a few boxes that would make this more likely, I’m a virgin (waiting for marriage) and don’t masturbate, plus, while I have made out with a girl before, this is far more intense, and I am definitely more into her. I have talked to her about this, and she says it makes her feel incredible, so I’m not worried about scaring her off by doing this, I’d just rather not. Is there a way of preventing this that isn’t just stopping when I feel it coming and waiting?

"For backstory and context, when my husband and I first started dating, he was very upfront that he didn’t see himself as a father. He’d gone through a tough experience in his previous relationship, including a difficult breakup after trying for children. But after we got married, things changed. A couple of years in, he came to me and said he was ready to be a dad. A few months later, I was pregnant. We had a beautiful, healthy daughter, and everything seemed perfect. He stepped into the role of a dad seamlessly, and our little girl absolutely adores him.

However, after her birth, my husband began struggling. He started showing signs of depression, which was made worse by his long work hours and lack of sleep. During some of our more heated arguments, he confessed to feeling emotionally detached from her, like she was more of an obligation than his child. He’s been seeing a therapist, and I thought things were improving. He’s a fantastic father on paper—he provides for her, plays with her, and makes sure all her needs are met. But I can sense that he’s distant, especially when he’s overwhelmed.

Today, after a particularly rough night with her constant waking and crying due to colic, he sent me a text while I was out running errands. It said, ""I’m at my breaking point. I can’t handle the crying anymore. This morning, I had this urge to just leave her in her crib and walk out the door. I need help or I’m going to snap."" My heart sank. I immediately called my sister to come over and stay with him and the baby. We had a long conversation, and he’s clearly in a very dark place.

It feels like a sudden shift, and I’m terrified of what could happen if it happens again and he can't control those thoughts. I feel helpless and lost, and I don’t know what to do to protect both him and our daughter. It’s tearing me apart inside.","arka plan ve bağlam için kocamla ilk çıkmaya başladığımızda kendini bir baba olarak görmediğini çok açık bir şekilde söylemişti, çocuk sahibi olmaya çalıştıktan sonra yaşadığı zor bir ayrılık da dahil olmak üzere önceki ilişkisinde zor bir deneyim yaşamıştı ancak evlendikten sonra birkaç yıl içinde her şey değişti, yanıma geldi ve baba olmaya hazır olduğunu söyledi, birkaç ay sonra hamileydim, güzel ve sağlıklı bir kızımız oldu ve her şey mükemmel görünüyordu, sorunsuz bir şekilde baba rolüne büründü ve küçük kızımız ona bayılıyor

ancak doğumundan sonra kocam mücadele etmeye başladı, uzun çalışma saatleri ve uyku eksikliği nedeniyle daha da kötüleşen depresyon belirtileri göstermeye başladı, daha hararetli tartışmalarımızdan bazılarında, çocuğundan daha çok bir yükümlülükmüş gibi duygusal olarak ondan uzak hissettiğini itiraf etti, bir terapiste gidiyordu ve her şeyin düzeldiğini düşünüyordum, kağıt üzerinde harika bir baba, onun ihtiyaçlarını karşılıyor, onunla oynuyor ve tüm ihtiyaçlarının karşılandığından emin oluyor ancak özellikle bunaldığında mesafeli olduğunu hissedebiliyorum

"So for the last 4 days I have gotten countless apple notifications that an unrecognized AirTag has been following my location. I can tell it’s definitely in/on my car as it’s been located at every place I’ve been for these past few days. Every time apple gives me the notification it gives me an option to disable it, but I get a error and it tells me disabling the AirTag failed. I have torn my car apart and even got my dad to look under the hood and under the car itself, and nothing. What do I do? I can’t think of anyone that would put it in my car and it’s starting to really freak me out. Can anyone tell me how to properly disable it or what I can do to find it in the car? 


[UPDATE:] 
Hope im doing this right, I don’t use reddit often. I took my car into the shop first thing this morning and they found the AirTag. It was duck taped to the top my exhaust pipe. I’m officially freaked tf out. I filed a police report and they unfortunately don’t seem to be taking me very seriously, the first woman I talked to even asked me if someone would do this as a prank and thought I should just call my friends/coworkers and ask. i don’t think I have to say it but I know for a fact that is not the case, this is the farthest thing from a funny joke and the people I associate with think the same. Either way, they took the AirTag and said they would ‘look into it.’ (I really hope they actually mean that) I live in a smaller town with a high crime rate, so I’m worried this will be put on the back burner. Either way, I’ve listened to y’all, I’m taking extra precautions, and for those who have suggested it’s an ex, I’m currently looking into it and gave his name to the police just in case. thank you all so much, and if I find anything else or if something comes up I’ll let you know. 


FINAL EDIT: ok so now that I can talk about this I thought I’d let y’all know what happened! I’m not sure how to do this (again, not on Reddit a lot, hope I’m doing this right) but I will try my best. It was my ex. Legal action has been taken and in my state it’s kinda hard to prove stalking but he shot himself in the foot with the tracker, not to mention he fully admitted to doing it over text to try and scare me. It was a super easy and quick court hearing lol. not important but I thought I’d let y’all know he got kicked out of his place over this and it makes me giggle when I think about it (karma lol) thank you guys so much for everything, whoever told me to get my car checked is a lifesaver!!!! Stay safe ladies ","son günlerde tanınmayan bir airtag'in konumumu takip ettiğine dair sayısız apple bildirimi aldım, kesinlikle arabamda olduğunu söyleyebilirim çünkü son birkaç gündür bulunduğum her yerde bulunuyordu apple bana bildirim verdiğinde onu devre dışı bırakma seçeneği sunuyor ancak bir hata alıyorum ve airtag'i devre dışı bırakmanın başarısız olduğunu söylüyor arabamı parçaladım ve hatta babamdan kaputun altına ve arabanın altına bakmasını istedim ve hiçbir şey yok ne yapmalıyım bunu arabama koyacak birini düşünemiyorum ve beni gerçekten korkutmaya başlıyor biri bana nasıl devre dışı bırakacağımı veya arabada nasıl bulabileceğimi söyleyebilir mi

umarım bunu doğru yapıyorumdur reddit'i sık kullanmıyorum bu sabah arabamı tamirciye götürdüm ve airtag'i buldular egzoz borumun üstüne bantlanmıştı resmen çıldırdım bir polis raporu tuttum ve ne yazık ki beni çok ciddiye almıyorlar konuştuğum ilk kadın bana şaka amaçlı bunu yapıp yapamayacağını sordu ve şöyle düşündü arkadaşlarımı, iş arkadaşlarımı arayıp sormalıyım sanırım söylememe gerek yok ama bunun böyle olmadığını biliyorum bu komik bir şakadan çok uzak ve görüştüğüm insanlar da aynı şeyi düşünüyor her iki durumda da hava etiketini aldılar ve araştıracaklarını söylediler umarım gerçekten kastettikleri şey yüksek suç oranına sahip küçük bir kasabada yaşıyorum bu yüzden bunun arka plana atılacağından endişeleniyorum her iki durumda da sizi dinledim ekstra önlemler alıyorum ve eski sevgilim olduğunu söyleyenler için şu anda araştırıyorum ve ismini polise verdim her ihtimale karşı hepinize çok teşekkür ederim ve başka bir şey bulursam veya bir şey çıkarsa size haber veririm

"I had a little get together a few weeks ago. The next day I found my bottle of Pappy Van Winkle 15 year had been emptied. It was in my sort of out of the way expensive whiskey drawer that I never told anyone at the party about. MSRP on the bottle I think is like $150 (good luck), but I paid almost 1k. It is extremely rare and it was my yolo bottle for my wedding. 

I asked my friends and my best man admitted he found it trying to get more booze. My friends shared it and I was too drunk to realize. He had no idea it was that special and said he would buy a new one. Here’s the thing. You don’t just go out and buy a bottle of Pappy. Most liquor stores don’t have it and by some miracle they do, it’s 2k easy. I paid 1k and that was cheap for secondary. I explained this and he thought what you guys are probably thinking and said that’s ridiculous to pay for whiskey. 

My friends all split some Johnny Walker Blue label (it’s like $150 and they think it’s top shelf. I hate scotch) As a way to make up for it. My friends also don’t understand my passion for whiskey and how much I wanted that exact bottle at my wedding. They think the scotch makes it even. We’ve argued for weeks and they just don’t understand. I don’t know what to do. Even if I get them to understand, they are completely unwilling to pay minimum 400 each for a new one.

For my whiskey enthusiasts out there, I think the worst part was they said it tasted pretty good with coke.

Edit: One thing I want to point out is I have no leverage here. These are basically all of my groomsmen and if I try to uninvite them (not actually considering it), it would make the wedding extremely weird. I don’t think I have the heart to do it and my fiancé would be upset even if she understands.p","birkaç hafta önce küçük bir toplantı yaptım ertesi gün pappy van winkle şişemin boşaldığını gördüm partide kimseye söylemediğim pahalı viski çekmecemdeydi şişenin üzerindeki msrp'yi iyi şanslar olarak görüyorum ama neredeyse k ödedim bu çok nadir bir şişe ve düğünüm için yolo şişemdi

arkadaşlarıma sordum ve sağdıcım daha fazla içki almaya çalışırken bulduğunu itiraf etti arkadaşlarım paylaştı ve ben çok sarhoştum bunun ne kadar özel olduğunu bilmediğini ve yenisini alacağını söyledi işte olay şu ki dışarı çıkıp bir şişe pappy satın alamazsın çoğu içki dükkanında yok ve bir mucize eseri var k kolay ben k ödedim ve bu ikinci el için ucuzdu bunu açıkladım ve sizin muhtemelen düşündüğünüzü düşündü ve viski için ödeme yapmanın saçma olduğunu söyledi

arkadaşlarımın hepsi johnny walker blue label'ı paylaştı ve bunun en üst raf olduğunu düşünüyorlar telafi etmek için viskiden nefret ediyorum arkadaşlarım da viskiye olan tutkumu anlamıyor ve düğünümde tam olarak o şişeyi ne kadar istediğimi, haftalardır tartışsak bile viskinin iyi olduğunu düşünüyorlar ve anlamıyorlar, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, onları anlasam bile, yeni bir viski için her biri için minimum ödeme yapmaya tamamen isteksizler

"I was born with an internally messed up nose. It looks fine externally maybe a slight asymmetry but the real issue with it is it caused weaker breathing and deviated septum and a complete loss of smell.

I am 23 as well. What I am asking is simple.

3. What should I smell good and bad?

"For context, my boyfriend just turned 40. He's a recovering alcoholic. He's quit before for a little while and it ended when a family member gifted him several bottles of alcohol. He's decided to quit again and is 14 days in, no drinking. It was going as expected. He was sick, puking, and sleeping a lot. He was still aware and talking eating drinking fluids ECT. He was normal, just sick. Well his gut is distended. He's been complaining of back pain because of it so I've been massaging his back for him. 3 days ago he was feeling pretty bad and slept a lot more than usual but nothing out of the ordinary. Well 2 days ago he went to sleep and has only woken up to puke, bathroom, and sip water. He's still like that and very out of it. Anytime I ask him a question he cant coherently answer me. I tried to get him to eat, and he won't. I don't even think he realizes it's been 2 days since he's been asleep or eaten anything. I'm extremely worried about him. 
  
A couple of hours ago his mom called, and he's having issues using his hands. He keeps dropping stuff and knocking stuff over. So I picked up for him and handed him the phone. He just kind of laid it next to him like he forgot what he was doing and went back to sleep immediately so I spoke with his mom and she agreed I should take him to the hospital in the morning. He's yellow, distended, puking, and out of it. I looked in his face and he looks so thin? I'm not sure how to explain it. Not like skinny thin, but like everything has been drained from his face. He looks so frail. His stomach is so out of place since hes a medium sized guy. He has a pregnant woman's gut. 

Now that you know the same facts I do, here's where I need advice. How do I get him to the hospital? I am afraid I can't get him to cooperate or be able to walk to an Uber, and where we live we risk being kicked out if we call an ambulance (we live in an area with a lot of drug addicts. We live in a motel and the owners don't speak English very well and I'm scared she'll say we are a problem assuming it's drug related and kick us out) (for more context we've been here for a few years) I also worry because he does not have insurance and an ambulance here (USA) is VERY expensive. I understand they won't reject taking him because of that but I do not want to make a decision like that without asking him first which is not a choice right now. I don't really know anyone that can take us. We do not do anything illegal, we are just in hard circumstances in life right now. I don't know how to get him to the hospital, does anyone have any ideas? And please, be kind. I'm under a lot of stress right now trying to take care of the situation. Thank you!


UPDATE: ambulance is on its way 

UPDATE 2: The ambulance took him to the hospital. He had blood pooling out of the side of his mouth shortly before I posted the first update. I am on the way to the hospital to meet him there. I'll keep posting updates. 

UPDATE 3: I am in the hospital room with him. He's still pretty out of it. The lady had to get some info from me. I haven't been able to talk to a doctor to figure out what's going on yet, as I just got here. He looks like he's in a lot of pain, I feel so horrible. I will keep updating everyone as I'm updated. 

UPDATE 4: doctor told me he was really sick. Basically he would have been dead today or tomorrow. He's going to have to be x rayed and put on dialysis and a whole bunch of other stuff I can't quite remember right now. He got transferred to another hospital here in our city. I'm here with him now. Hes got some gloves on because he keeps pulling out everything they put on him. He's extremely confused. I'm being allowed to stay with him. Let's hope it gets better. I'll update in a while when I know more about what's going on. 

UPDATE 5: So the doctor came and saw me just a few minutes ago. She said what the other doctor said and she also told me his ammonia  levels were 100. She said specialist doctors are going to come and run tests on him. I asked with dialysis and everything (treatment in general) how long would he have. She said if this is his normal then he has 2 years at best. I'm broken, I'm sleep deprived, I'm lost. My heart feels like it's been ripped out of my chest. I would give anything to take his pain and sickness and give it to myself instead. I'm so upset I can't even describe how I am feeling. Let's hope for the best when they run their tests! 

UPDATE 6: scans told us exactly what I thought they would. None of it was good. He's filled with fluids. The ammonia build up in his body was what was causing his confusion. But great news! He just became aware again and I was able to sit down and talk to him. He wanted me to get in his bed with him and snuggle him, but I asked the doctor and it's a special bed that keeps his weight and everything and with all the cords from IVs and whatnot I couldn't. But I rubbed his back and head until he fell asleep again. His son and his mom and cousin are coming to see him tomorrow from the next state over.  They said I can continue to stay with him and it's better I stay anyways, due to patient safety. Which I'm happy about. They have him on some special medicine that is tricking his body into filtering out the ammonia through his feces instead of his kidneys. He's used the bathroom on himself 2 times today which was hard to see, because it's just not him but I am glad it's made him better. These last 3 nights have felt like weeks to me. I'm exhausted but I think I can finally sleep tonight in the chair next to him knowing he's coming back. He still has a long road ahead of him, so there will be more updates as the doctors fill me in more and more about his situation. Thank you for your support everyone, I truly appreciate it!

UPDATE 7: They cannot do the stomach tap to get the fluid out until they thicken his blood. They are getting him started on vitamin K. he also woke up with his legs and feet swollen. Physical therapy came and walked with him and they said he shouldn't need physical therapy which is good! He finally yelled at me today to go home. Apparently he was asking me for something and I was checked out. I'm so exhausted and I know he's right. So I'm trying to find a cheap taxi home or see if the hospital can provide transport for me. I plan on going home to sleep for a little bit then coming back later. I ended up crying from frustration. I'm not frustrated with him, I am frustrated with myself that I am not able to stay awake. I even walked around the hospital and ate breakfast trying to stay awake and I ended up falling asleep standing up. I'm anxious about going home and not being able to keep a close eye on him, but I know I don't really have a choice. I'm gonna get some rest so I can be back and awake for him! Hoping for the best!!! More updates soon!

UPDATE 7 (continued): I was able to get some sleep. I must admit I feel so tired still but much better now that I'm not sleeping standing up lol. I am packing some things to go back to the hospital. His mom called me and she was very sweet, telling me to take care of myself and that she loves and thanks me for helping her son. I was also able to get my medication (antibiotics) for my infection from a cervical surgery I had recently. I'll update once again once I get to the hospital and learn what I missed out on! 

The doctor said it's best to try and get his stomach to go down naturally rather than try to tap it since it may cause permanent damage. They are giving him plasma infused with vitamin K. Let's hope it goes down! I'm going to be making a GoFundMe for him tonight. He needs to be in an actual home. We also met with someone today to try and get him on medicade. I'm feeling much better since I got some rest today. I really appreciate the help and encouragement from everyone. I know it's silly since it's the Internet but it's really kept me going for himself and me. Thank you guys, more updates coming as soon as I know more!

UPDATE 8: He had his stomach drained today. 2.8 liters! That's a lot of fluid! He's started getting really irritated and unfortunately taking it out on me. I know he doesn't mean it and he's apologized to me. Like he didn't like his dinner today so I went to the cafeteria and got him a cheeseburger and I got the wrong kind of cheese on it and he had a fit. He then apologized and ate it and asked me to get him some pie 😂 such a silly man. His legs and feet are extremely swollen. He cried today because he's scared (about the swelling and getting drained). I am glad I'm here to be his rock. I am drained myself but I'm still staying strong for him. I was able to make and launch the GoFundMe last night. No donations so far but let's hope it gets noticed! We are going to try and get him on disability which will help me be able to pay rent and everything else until he's able to get back to being himself. Hopefully I can raise enough to be able to get an actual home (apartment or house). My infection came back from my surgery because I wasn't able to finish my antibiotics and my doctor told me I have to go back to the ER today. I will go tomorrow or the next day. I know I have to be healthy in order to be able to help him. So I won't push it off too much longer. I will be coming out with more updates soon. Hopefully he can get the swelling down and we can just go home together soon. I miss laying in bed with him. 

UPDATE 9: It's been awhile since I've posted and I'm not sure if anyone checks back anymore, but I'll catch you guys up. His tests kept getting better and he was doing better. He had one episode where he was seizing and bleeding but everything came back normal (CT scan, blood sugar, and vitals) he was walking better and his swollen legs and feet started going down. After his seizure incident the staff wouldn't let him walk outside which really pissed him off. He got to come home with me yesterday. One of the staff helped us get a taxi. He's home now and as suspected we are having trouble getting his meds while we wait for his disability to kick in. We spoke to the staff about it and there isn't much more they can do except wait like us. He's depressed which is understandable, but at least he's being conscious of his health now. He could still die, especially if he doesn't do what he's supposed to which I'm not worried about. I'm only worried we won't be able to do what he's gotta do. The GoFundMe I made for him hasn't gotten any recognition even though I shared it across many platforms. I'm feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, and frustrated. One of my family members even tried to get me to leave him because I'm, ""wasting my youth worrying about him."" Yes, I've cut them off. I am not worried about my youth, I'm worried about the man I love. I just want the nightmare to end. I want him to be healthy and I want us to be in a real place like an apartment.

UPDATE 10: We are back in the ER. I think they may keep him again. We don't know what's going on with him yet, but I'll let you guys know with a continuation of update 10.

UPDATE 11: His kidneys were failing again. Slowly but failing none the less. we finally got home 2 days ago. He is happy to be home and in his own bed. We got a month's worth of free samples of his medicine from the hospital and I've been making sure he takes everything on time. Hopefully we don't have to spend any more time in the hospital anytime soon. I don't think I can handle sleeping upright in a chair anymore. My back is definitely feeling it. He's still pretty yellow but not as bright yellow as he was. His stomach is still distended and swollen. He'll have to keep getting drained still. His skin is also still holding water but hopefully it gets better with medication. we have been walking and being active to help his swelling. He's not out of the woods yet, as I said his kidneys are still failing. I hope it gets better and he lives a full life. I'll keep posting updates as things progress. Thanks for checking back in ❤️

UPDATE 12: He's slowly getting better. His legs aren't swollen anymore and he's getting sick less and less. It's been a wild ride and he's got lots to-do still. He got denied for insurance but we got them to re-evaluate. We decided to get married! I truly love him for better or for worse. Thank you all for checking in on us, I appreciate you all!

UPDATE 13: We are back in the ER. He woke up confused, and seizing. He was bleeding from his mouth and nose again. He hasn't drank a drop of alcohol and has been taking his medication. He's hallucinating, confused, and not feeling well. He says his stomach hurts and that he's freezing cold even with 2 heavy blankets on and a hoodie. I'm not sure what's going on yet. They did some blood work, gave him some fluid and are working on CT scan orders even though it's taking forever. Here we go, round #2. I'll keep those of you who still check in updated. ","for context my boyfriend just turned  hes a recovering alcoholic hes quit before for a little while and it ended when a family member gifted him several bottles of alcohol hes decided to quit again and is  days in no drinking it was going as expected he was sick puking and sleeping a lot he was still aware and talking eating drinking fluids ect he was normal just sick well his gut is distended hes been complaining of back pain because of it so ive been massaging his back for him  days ago he was feeling pretty bad and slept a lot more than usual but nothing out of the ordinary well  days ago he went to sleep and has only woken up to puke bathroom and sip water hes still like that and very out of it anytime i ask him a question he cant coherently answer me i tried to get him to eat and he wont i dont even think he realizes its been  days since hes been asleep or eaten anything im extremely worried about him 
  
a couple of hours ago his mom called and hes having issues using his hands he keeps dropping stuff and knocking stuff over so i picked up for him and handed him the phone he just kind of laid it next to him like he forgot what he was doing and went back to sleep immediately so i spoke with his mom and she agreed i should take him to the hospital in the morning hes yellow distended puking and out of it i looked in his face and he looks so thin im not sure how to explain it not like skinny thin but like everything has been drained from his face he looks so frail his stomach is so out of place since hes a medium sized guy he has a pregnant womans gut 

now that you know the same facts i do heres where i need advice how do i get him to the hospital i am afraid i cant get him to cooperate or be able to walk to an uber and where we live we risk being kicked out if we call an ambulance we live in an area with a lot of drug addicts we live in a motel and the owners dont speak english very well and im scared shell say we are a problem assuming its drug related and kick us out for more context weve been here for a few years i also worry because he does not have insurance and an ambulance here usa is very expensive i understand they wont reject taking him because of that but i do not want to make a decision like that without asking him first which is not a choice right now i dont really know anyone that can take us we do not do anything illegal we are just in hard circumstances in life right now i dont know how to get him to the hospital does anyone have any ideas and please be kind im under a lot of stress right now trying to take care of the situation thank you

"I (M25), and my now ex-girlfriend is (F22). We've been together for a few years, and everything was going great until she started pressuring me to get married and have kids. I wasn't ready for that kind of commitment, and I made it clear to her.

However, she wouldn't let it go. She kept bringing it up, trying to convince me that we should take our relationship to the next level. I felt suffocated and stressed out by her constant nagging.

Then, one day, I discovered something that completely shattered my trust in her. I found her poking holes in the condoms we were using. I was shocked and angry beyond words. It felt like a huge betrayal of my trust and our relationship.

I confronted her about it, and she tried to downplay it, saying she just wanted to ""speed things up"" because she knew I was hesitant about having kids. But I couldn't believe her excuses. I couldn't be with someone who would manipulate me like that.

So, I ended things with her. It was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make, but I knew it was the right thing for me. I couldn't stay with someone who didn't respect my boundaries and would go behind my back like that.

Some of our mutual friends are saying I overreacted and that breaking up with her was too harsh. But I can't shake the feeling that I dodged a bullet. ","ben ve şimdiki eski kız arkadaşım f birlikteyiz birkaç yıldır ve her şey harika gidiyordu ta ki bana evlenmem ve çocuk sahibi olmam için baskı yapmaya başlayana kadar bu tür bir bağlılığa hazır değildim ve bunu ona açıkça belirttim

ancak o bunu bırakmadı sürekli gündeme getirdi ilişkimizi bir sonraki seviyeye taşımamız gerektiğine beni ikna etmeye çalıştı sürekli sızlanması yüzünden boğulmuş ve stresli hissettim

sonra bir gün ona olan güvenimi tamamen yerle bir eden bir şey keşfettim kullandığımız prezervatiflerde delikler açtığını gördüm kelimelerle anlatılamayacak kadar şok oldum ve öfkelendim güvenime ve ilişkimize büyük bir ihanet gibi hissettim

onunla bu konuda yüzleştim ve bunu önemsiz göstermeye çalıştı sadece işleri hızlandırmak istediğini söyledi çünkü çocuk sahibi olmak konusunda tereddüt ettiğimi biliyordu ama onun bahanelerine inanamadım beni böyle manipüle eden biriyle birlikte olamazdım

bu yüzden onunla ilişkimi bitirdim bu şimdiye kadar almam gereken en zor kararlardan biriydi ama bunun benim için doğru şey olduğunu biliyordum bana saygı duymayan biriyle birlikte olamazdım sınırlarım ve arkamdan böyle işler çevirirler

ortak arkadaşlarımızdan bazıları aşırı tepki verdiğimi ve onunla ayrılmamın çok sert olduğunu söylüyor ama bir kurşundan kurtulduğum hissinden kurtulamıyorum"
"My (28M) cousin (20F) has a boyfriend with the same first name as me, same spelling. They've been together for about a year-ish and over the past year she has frequently sent me texts meant for him. Most of the time it's menial things, random bits of conversation out of context, never anything bad or inappropriate. It's an understandable mistake and she always says ""Sorry"" or ""Whoops, wrong [my name]"". 

Only once before a couple months ago did she slip up and send me a wrong image and it was a photo of her in lingerie in a store changing room with a sexy caption meant for her boyfriend. She's worn bikinis around me in real life before so it wasn't anything I hadn't seen before in terms of partial nudity, but it was nonetheless at that point that I had to tell her to please be extra careful with which [my name] she is sending texts too and she said she will be more diligent in the future. She apologized and we moved on. Sometimes though, we do legitimately send each other memes or other funny things back and forth and getting a photo or video from her every now and then is not abnormal. We also both watch the TV show The Bear and will text about it whenever there are new episodes out. As ""the older cousin"" that's pretty much the extent of our relationship.

The past few months she has been very good with not sending me wrong messages...until now. Yesterday morning very early in the morning I received a text from her with a video. The video thumbnail was just a wall and a stool and the text caption said ""Good morning :)"". I assumed it was a meme or some other weird funny video so I pressed play and it turned out to be a video of my cousin completely naked, sitting on the stool, spreading her legs towards the camera and masturbating herself with a vibrator. I obviously clicked off as soon as I put together what I was seeing but I still saw *everything*. Crystal clear HD phone video taken in bright lighting. Unlike the previous instances there was no message afterwards saying ""Sorry"" or ""Don't watch that video"" or anything of the sort. Just the video of her naked masturbating and total radio silence since then.

I have chosen not to respond in any way because I think any response will lead her to assume that I have seen the content of the video, which is, in fact, true.

I have 2 assumptions of what happened. 
1) She tried to unsend it or cancel send as fast as she could and thought she was successful, not realizing it already went through on my end. This would explain the lack of a follow up. Or
2) She knows she sent it to me and is simply too mortified to say anything about it at all, which is completely understandable. This seems like the more likely option, but I can't know for sure. I know she has been on her phone because she has been actively updating her Instagram story and she looked at mine that I posted later that morning, but she has not said a single thing to me directly.

I am supposed to see her in person 2 days from now for my other cousin's (her older brother's) wedding, who I am pretty close with. I assume her boyfriend will also be there since he's usually with her at family functions. To be honest, if this happened with a cousin my age or older I probably wouldn't care as much, but she's been a kid for as long as I've known her up until a few years ago and our relationship is like that. If she does know she sent it to me, all of this will add to the awkward factor. She is an adult now but I have always thought of her as one of my kid cousins and now I've seen her masturbating and she probably knows it. If she doesn't know she sent it, then I guess nothing will happen. But I don't know if she knows.

What's the safest course of action? I don't want to confront her about it directly in person and risk a really uncomfortable conversation around others - especially if her boyfriend doesn't know - and I also don't want her to avoid me all day and keep it awkward between us forever, which could be the case if I say and do nothing.

I have no idea what to do. Has something like this ever happened to anyone else here? What did you do?

UPDATE Sunday 9/8/24: We avoided each other for most of the ceremony but afterwards during the reception we met waiting in line for food and she actually apologized without me having to say anything. She asked if me I saw the contents of the video and I said yes. She was mortified but acknowledged it was her wrongdoing and I made sure she changed my contact name to something more distinguishable. We both agreed never to speak of it. Her boyfriend doesn't know.
","kuzenim f'nin benimle aynı adı taşıyan bir erkek arkadaşı var aynı yazım yaklaşık bir yıldır birlikteler ve geçen yıl boyunca bana sık sık ona yönelik mesajlar gönderdi çoğunlukla önemsiz şeyler bağlam dışı rastgele konuşma parçaları asla kötü veya uygunsuz bir şey değil anlaşılabilir bir hata ve her zaman özür dilerim veya yanlış adım diyor

sadece bir kaç ay önce bir kez hata yaptı ve bana yanlış bir resim gönderdi ve bu onun bir mağazanın soyunma odasında iç çamaşırıyla çekilmiş bir fotoğrafıydı ve erkek arkadaşına yönelik seksi bir başlık vardı daha önce gerçek hayatta etrafımda bikini giydi bu yüzden daha önce kısmi çıplaklık açısından görmediğim bir şey değildi ama yine de o noktada ona mesaj atarken lütfen adımı daha dikkatli göndermesini söylemem gerekti ve gelecekte daha dikkatli olacağını söyledi özür diledi ve bazen devam ettik ama birbirimize meşru olarak meme'ler veya diğer komik şeyler gönderiyoruz ve ara sıra ondan bir fotoğraf veya video almak anormal değil ayrıca ikimiz de televizyon dizisini izliyoruz ayı ve yeni bölümler çıktığında bunun hakkında mesaj atacağım çünkü büyük kuzen ilişkimizin boyutu aşağı yukarı bu

geçtiğimiz birkaç ayda bana yanlış mesaj gönderme konusunda çok iyiydi ta ki dün sabaha kadar sabahın çok erken saatlerinde ondan bir video mesajı aldım video küçük resmi sadece bir duvar ve bir tabureydi ve metin başlığı günaydın diyordu bunun bir meme veya başka garip komik bir video olduğunu varsaydım bu yüzden oynat tuşuna bastım ve kuzenimin tamamen çıplak bir şekilde taburede oturup bacaklarını kameraya doğru açıp kendini bir vibratörle mastürbasyon yaptığı bir video olduğu ortaya çıktı gördüklerimi bir araya getirdiğimde hemen kapattım ama yine de her şeyi kristal netliğinde gördüm parlak ışıkta çekilmiş hd telefon videosu önceki örneklerin aksine sonrasında özür dilerim veya o videoyu izlemeyin veya benzeri bir mesaj yoktu sadece çıplak mastürbasyon yaptığı video ve o zamandan beri tamamen sessizdi

herhangi bir şekilde yanıt vermemeyi seçtim çünkü herhangi bir yanıtın videonun içeriğini gördüğümü varsaymasına yol açacağını düşünüyorum ki bu aslında doğru

ne olduğu konusunda varsayımlarım var
denedi göndermeyi geri almak veya göndermeyi olabildiğince hızlı iptal etmek ve başarılı olduğunu düşünmesi ve bunun benim tarafımdan çoktan iletildiğini fark etmemesi bu bir takip eksikliğini açıklar veya
bana gönderdiğini biliyor ve bunun hakkında hiçbir şey söyleyemeyecek kadar utanıyor ki bu tamamen anlaşılabilir bir durum bu daha olası bir seçenek gibi görünüyor ama emin olamıyorum telefonunda olduğunu biliyorum çünkü aktif olarak instagram hikayesini güncelliyor ve o sabah paylaştığım hikayeme baktı ama bana doğrudan tek bir şey söylemedi

birkaç gün sonra diğer kuzenlerimin ağabeyinin düğünü için onu şahsen görmem gerekiyor, oldukça yakın olduğum erkek arkadaşının da orada olacağını varsayıyorum çünkü dürüst olmak gerekirse aile toplantılarında genellikle onunla birlikte oluyor bu benim yaşımda veya daha büyük bir kuzeniyle olsaydı muhtemelen çok umursamazdım ama onu tanıdığım sürece birkaç yıl öncesine kadar bir çocuktu ve ilişkimiz böyle eğer bana gönderdiğini biliyorsa tüm bunlar garip faktöre eklenecek o artık bir yetişkin ama ben onu her zaman çocuk kuzenlerimden biri olarak düşündüm ve şimdi onu mastürbasyon yaparken gördüm ve muhtemelen bunu biliyordur eğer gönderdiğini bilmiyorsa o zaman sanırım hiçbir şey olmayacak ama onun bilip bilmediğini bilmiyorum

en güvenli hareket tarzı nedir onunla bunu doğrudan yüz yüze konuşmak ve özellikle erkek arkadaşı bilmiyorsa başkalarının yanında gerçekten rahatsız edici bir konuşma riskini almak istemiyorum ve ayrıca onun bütün gün benden kaçınmasını ve aramızdaki garipliği sonsuza dek sürdürmesini istemiyorum ki eğer hiçbir şey söyleyip yapmazsam durum böyle olabilir

"Sensitive topic* TW: I’ll be mentioning rape. 

When I (19f) was 5-6 years old, me and my mom moved into her boyfriends house and he had 2 sons and a daughter. The oldest son was about 15 and every night for a year would come into my room, bring me down to the basement where his room was and rape me. I won’t get into detail on it. I now have a boyfriend and he knows about this and is super understanding, but last night we were about to have sex and I had a panic attack and I felt like I was a child again. I’ve also been having a lot of nightmares about this childhood trauma and it’s been getting worse. The other day I was on Facebook and found my moms ex and I then found his other son, from there I found my childhood rapists account through a comment, but his last name was changed because apparently he was adopted but it was weird it was changed back to his original last name. And he wasn’t friends with his dad. I think it’s because he did something to his sister but that is not confirmed. I clicked on my childhood rapists Facebook and he is living his best life, he is smiling, has a beautiful wife, and overall just happy. While I’m left here broken. 

I want to tell his wife or at least his dad about what happened but I don’t know if I should. What’s the best advice?

EDIT: I’ve read everyone’s responses and I’ve decided to get a therapist. I wanted to reply to peoples answers but it started opening new wounds. I come from a small rural town, and his town is only an hour away so it is not hard to find each other. I don’t know the laws where I’m from and there really is no proof of what he did and I don’t want to be charged with anything for “ruining his life”. Many people said take revenge but I’m mostly just worried for any possible future kids and his wife. Once I get a therapist I will take their advice. ","hassas bir konu, tecavüzden bahsedeceğim

ben yaşındayken annem ve ben onun erkek arkadaşının evine taşındık ve oğulları ve bir kızı vardı en büyük oğlu etraftaydı ve bir yıl boyunca her gece odama gelip beni odasının olduğu bodruma indirip bana tecavüz ediyordu, bunun ayrıntılarına girmeyeceğim şimdi bir erkek arkadaşım var ve o bunu biliyor ve çok anlayışlı ama dün gece seks yapacaktık ve panik atak geçirdim ve tekrar çocukmuşum gibi hissettim ayrıca bu çocukluk travmasıyla ilgili çok fazla kabus görüyorum ve daha da kötüye gidiyor geçen gün facebook'taydım ve annemin eski sevgilisini buldum ve sonra oradan diğer oğlunu buldum çocukluk tecavüzcüsünün hesabını bir yorum aracılığıyla buldum ama soyadı değiştirilmişti çünkü görünüşe göre evlat edinilmişti ama garipti orijinal soyadına geri dönmüştü ve babasıyla arkadaş değildi sanırım bunun nedeni kız kardeşine bir şey yapmış olması ama bu doğrulanmadı çocukluk tecavüzcüsünün facebook'una tıkladım ve hayatının en iyi hayatını yaşıyor gülümsüyor güzel bir karısı var ve genel olarak mutlu ben buradayken kırık

karısına veya en azından babasına olanları anlatmak istiyorum ama yapmalı mıyım bilmiyorum en iyi tavsiye nedir

düzenleme herkesin yanıtlarını okudum ve bir terapist bulmaya karar verdim insanların yanıtlarına yanıt vermek istedim ama yeni yaralar açmaya başladı küçük bir kırsal kasabadan geliyorum ve onun kasabası sadece bir saat uzaklıkta bu yüzden birbirimizi bulmak zor değil nereden geldiğimi bilmiyorum ve gerçekten ne yaptığına dair hiçbir kanıt yok ve hayatını mahvettiğim için hiçbir şeyle suçlanmak istemiyorum birçok kişi intikam al dedi ama ben çoğunlukla gelecekteki olası çocuklarım ve karısı için endişeleniyorum bir terapist bulduğumda onların tavsiyesine uyacağım"
"I (26F) was raped by someone I’ve been friends with for 3 years a couple nights ago. Sparing the most of the details of the assault here. But important details: 1) he knows I’m celibate and that’s a choice I’ve been making for myself 2) when he started kissing me, I reminded him that I do not have sex 3) when he was actively assaulting me I was begging him to stop. 

Immediately after he was weepy and apologizing for hurting me. The next day he called me (I didn’t answer) and texted me saying he was freaking out and he wanted to make sure I was okay. 

The friend in me doesn’t want to ruin his life but then on the other hand, he assaulted me and caused me pain and injury. All of my friends I’ve talked to are telling me I should just report it to the police but it doesn’t feel that simple in my head. Has anyone had this experience? How do you reconcile the friend you know and the person who hurt you? ","Yıllardır arkadaş olduğum biri tarafından birkaç gece önce tecavüze uğradım, saldırının ayrıntılarının çoğunu burada saklıyorum ama önemli ayrıntılar, bekar olduğumu biliyor ve bu benim kendim için yaptığım bir seçim, beni öpmeye başladığında ona aktif olarak bana saldırdığında seks yapmayacağımı hatırlattım, durması için yalvarıyordum

hemen ağlamaya başladı ve beni incittiği için özür diledi, ertesi gün beni aradı, cevap vermedim ve bana çılgına döndüğünü ve iyi olduğumdan emin olmak istediğini söyleyen bir mesaj attı

içimdeki arkadaş hayatını mahvetmek istemiyor ama diğer yandan bana saldırdı ve bana acı ve yaralanma yaşattı, konuştuğum tüm arkadaşlarım bana bunu polise bildirmem gerektiğini söylüyor ama kafamda bu kadar basit gelmiyor, bunu yaşayan var mı? Tanıdığınız arkadaşınızla sizi inciten kişiyi nasıl uzlaştırırsınız?"
"My son (M15) just got suspended from his new school a second time both times for and I quote ""physically and verbally tormenting queer students."" I've tried to always teach him tolerance If he doesn't agree with a persons life style or ideals but he seems to have no empathy for anyone or anything. I previously had to move him from schools because of frequent incidents of fighting other kids, skipping classes, and bullying. They are threatening to expel him if his behavior doesn't get in check, He doesn't seem to care at all. He just hangs out with his friends all day and causes mayhem.

He acts extremally violent towards everybody including me yelling and threatening physical violence and often throwing rage fits. Not to mention he terrorizes his little sister and uses constant racist, homophobic, and sexist slurs publicly he has no respect for anyone. He also has been caught doing stuff like shoplifting with his friends, drinking at his homecoming dance, and vaping. I tried to take him to family therapy with me but that was a nightmare. I really don't know what to do I'm afraid for his future and the people around him.

I'm really trying my best to keep the family together but all the stress is putting a strain on me and my wife's marriage. My daughter hates her brother and I think my wife sees him as a monster. I love him so much and will never stop loving him but I don't know how to help him and I'm afraid he's only gonna get worse from here on so how can I help my son?

Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice I think I have a idea of what I'm going to do now. Just to clarify some stuff he's never physically hurt his sister or any of us before just yelling, screaming, and threats. Also he hasn't always be like this it really started when he started 6th grade and got progressively worse overtime. I will be putting him in private therapy and getting him professionally evaluated. I will also be restricting all internet access so no computer or phones instead I'm gonna replace his phone with a flip phone or something like that just incase he still needs to reach us. I will also be picking him up from school everyday and taking him straight home he is no longer able to hang out with his friends outside of school I've talked to the parents to make sure he isn't over at there houses. My daughter will be getting a lock on her door. Sending him away is a last resort and me and my wife are going to start going to couples therapy so wish he good luck and If anything new comes up I'll try my best to update you guys.","oğlum yeni okulundan ikinci kez uzaklaştırıldı, her ikisinde de eşcinsel öğrencilere fiziksel ve sözlü işkence yaptığı için ve alıntı yapıyorum, bir kişinin yaşam tarzı veya idealleriyle aynı fikirde değilse ona her zaman hoşgörü öğretmeye çalıştım ama kimseye veya hiçbir şeye karşı empati duymuyor gibi görünüyor, daha önce sık sık diğer çocuklarla kavga ettiği, dersleri kaçırdığı ve zorbalık yaptığı için onu okuldan almak zorunda kalmıştım, davranışları kontrol altına alınmazsa onu okuldan atmakla tehdit ediyorlardı, hiç umursamıyor gibi görünüyor, sadece bütün gün arkadaşlarıyla takılıyor ve kargaşa yaratıyor

"For some context, I (38F) and my husband (41M) sent our son, we’ll call him Max, (10M) to a church camp run by one of my husband’s friends. Max was so excited and didn’t even seem sad when we dropped him off. The camp was three days long and it was going to be with some of Max’s friends from youth church. He got back a little bit before Christmas, and it was like an entirely different person was controlling him. He was no longer bubbly and joyous. He spent all of his time in his room. My husband and I have to wake him up for him to get out of bed. He never has an appetite and he’s lost a visible amount of weight. He’s also picked up some strange habits, like he doesn’t want to sit down to do anything anymore. I don’t know what happened to him. I just want my baby boy back. We got him everything he wanted for Christmas and did all of his favorite activities, but he doesn’t even want to do that. Does anyone have any advice on what‘s going on with him?

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: thank you for all the replies. Many of you confirmed what I thought it was in the back of my mind, I just really hoped it wasn’t true. Many told me not to tell the camp to give them the hint that they needed to hide or something. I haven‘t been able to get Max in to see a doctor or a psychologist today, but he‘s scheduled to get in to see a doctor ASAP. I talk with him down after school and asked him about the camp. He was very secretive about it at first, but he started crying and apologizing and confirmed what most of you suspected. He told me that one of the counselors would come invite him into the counselor cabin to “play a game.” I’m truly horrified and I can’t believe that I couldn’t tell what was wrong earlier. I told him that whatever happened to him was not his fault and he didn’t need to apologize. I held him while he cried and then took him to his favorite restaurant and got him ice cream. He seems mildly better, but I don’t think I’ll ever have my son back. Max is in the shower right now and I’m waiting for my husband to decide what to do. I’ve already told Max that he doesn‘t need to go to church if he doesn’t feel comfortable, but he still wants to go to church because he likes the people there. I‘ll try my best to keep you updated in this mess, and I can’t tell you how thankful I am for all of your replies.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE 2: a lot of things have been happening and I haven’t really gotten a chance to sit down and update this until now. I got my son into a doctor and they essentially confirmed what had been happening. We were able to get a psychologist appointment on Tuesday, but for now I’ve just been trying to do things that make Max happy, like taking him out to eat and to the arcade. In regards to my husband, he’s currently staying with is mother. I told him what Max told me when he came home and that we should immediately contact the police and get the entire camp shut down. He started yelling about how I was crazy and I was trying to ruin his friend’s life and that we shouldn’t believe everything kids tell us. I think after he said that I just went into mama bear mode. I screamed at him that he was just as bad as those people and that we needed to end our relationship. He said that I was letting social media brainwash me into believing that Christians were all child molesters and that Max and I were the reason Pastors were believed to be pedos. I screamed back and told him that it wasn’t our son who was giving them a bad reputation and that it was the actual pedophiles who were giving them a bad reputation. I packed him a bag and I’ve been talking to a divorce lawyer. This whole even has turned Max and I’s lives upside down and I’m trying to be strong for him and keep faith that things will get better. Again, thank you for all of the replies and advice.","bazı bağlamlar için eğer ve kocam oğlumuzu, ona max m diyelim, kocamın arkadaşlarından birinin yönettiği bir kilise kampına gönderdik, max çok heyecanlıydı ve onu bıraktığımızda hiç üzgün görünmüyordu, kamp üç gün sürecekti ve max'in gençlik kilisesinden bazı arkadaşlarıyla olacaktı, noelden biraz önce geri döndü ve sanki onu tamamen farklı biri kontrol ediyordu, artık neşeli ve neşeli değildi, tüm zamanını odasında geçiriyordu, kocam ve ben onu yataktan kalkması için uyandırmak zorunda kalıyorduk, hiç iştahı olmuyordu ve gözle görülür bir kilo kaybı yaşadı, ayrıca bazı garip alışkanlıklar edindi, örneğin artık hiçbir şey yapmak için oturmak istemiyor, ona ne olduğunu bilmiyorum, sadece bebeğimi geri istiyorum, ona noel için istediği her şeyi aldık ve en sevdiği aktiviteleri yaptık ama bunları yapmak bile istemiyor, onunla ilgili neler olup bittiğine dair herhangi bir tavsiyesi olan var mı?

güncelleme tüm yanıtlar için teşekkür ederim, birçoğunuz aklımın bir köşesinde olduğunu düşündüğüm şeyi doğruladı, sadece bunun doğru olmamasını umuyordum Birçok kişi bana kampa söylememem gerektiğini, onlara saklanmaları gerektiği veya başka bir şey yapmaları gerektiği ipucunu vermemem gerektiğini söyledi. Bugün Max'i bir doktora veya psikoloğa götüremedim ama en kısa sürede doktora gitmesi planlanıyor. Okuldan sonra onunla konuştum ve ona kamp hakkında soru sordum. İlk başta çok gizli davrandı ama ağlamaya ve özür dilemeye başladı ve çoğunuzun şüphelendiği şeyi doğruladı. Bana danışmanlardan birinin gelip onu danışman kulübesine oyun oynamaya davet edeceğini söyledi. Gerçekten dehşete düştüm ve daha önce neyin yanlış olduğunu anlayamadığıma inanamıyorum. Ona başına gelen her neyse onun hatası olmadığını ve özür dilemesine gerek olmadığını söyledim. Ağlarken onu tuttum ve sonra onu en sevdiği restorana götürdüm ve ona dondurma aldım. Biraz daha iyi görünüyor ama oğlumu asla geri alamayacağım. Max şu anda duşta ve kocamın ne yapacağına karar vermesini bekliyorum. Max'e kendini rahat hissetmiyorsa kiliseye gitmesine gerek olmadığını söyledim ama oradaki insanları sevdiği için yine de kiliseye gitmek istiyor. Bu karmaşada sizi bilgilendirmek için elimden geleni yapacağım. ve tüm cevaplarınız için ne kadar minnettar olduğumu anlatamam

güncelleme bir sürü şey oldu ve şimdiye kadar oturup bunu güncelleme fırsatım olmadı oğlumu doktora götürdüm ve esasen ne olduğunu doğruladılar salı günü bir psikolog randevusu alabildik ama şimdilik sadece max'i mutlu edecek şeyler yapmaya çalışıyorum, mesela onu dışarıda yemeğe ve oyun salonuna götürmek gibi, şu anda annesiyle birlikte kaldığı kocamla ilgili olarak, max eve geldiğinde bana söylediklerini ve hemen polise haber vermemiz ve tüm kampı kapatmamız gerektiğini söyledim, deli olduğumu ve arkadaşlarının hayatını mahvetmeye çalıştığımı ve çocukların bize söylediği her şeye inanmamamız gerektiğini bağırmaya başladı sanırım bunu söyledikten sonra anne ayı moduna geçtim ona bağırarak onun da o insanlar kadar kötü olduğunu ve ilişkimizi bitirmemiz gerektiğini söyledim, sosyal medyanın beni Hristiyanların çocuk tacizcisi olduğuna ve max ve benim papazların sapık olduğuna inanmam için beyin yıkamasına izin verdiğimi söyledi, ben de karşılık olarak bağırdım ve ona oğlumuzun onlara kötü bir ün kazandırmadığını, onlara kötü bir ün kazandıranların gerçek pedofiller olduğunu söyledim. Ona bir çanta hazırladım ve bir boşanma avukatıyla konuştum. Tüm bunlar Max'i ve hayatını alt üst etti. Onun için güçlü olmaya ve her şeyin tekrar düzeleceğine inanmaya çalışıyorum. Tüm yanıtlar ve tavsiyeler için teşekkür ederim."
"So I, 18F got my parents a $200 gift card to a really nice steakhouse that I thought they would want to try. It’s enough to get them appetizers, entrees, and dessert. I was really excited because I haven’t been able to spoil my parents with big gifts before.  I had this conversation with my dad. He was talking about Christmas gifts and said that gift cards were the worst gift possible because they are unimaginative. I asked him “what about gift cards to restaurants?” And he said that was even worse because he’s gotten that before and they sit in his wallet and he never uses them. I feel awful, and I obviously can’t return the gift card. Do you think it will still be ok? I never told him that’s what I got him, but I’m super disappointed.

I was raped 3 months ago. I’m 18f. 

i read somewhere if u pretended to ‘enjoy’ it the perpetrator would be less rough. that’s what happened. i pretended like it was sex and i’ve never told anyone this. not even the cops or my therapist. 

i know it was rape. because he was an intruder and i begged him to stop. he was rough initially and it’s was so painful. so i realised the only way to make it less rough is to pretend like i wanted it. so i started enjoying it. i moaned and came with him. i feel so disgusted with myself. he raped me(idk if i should even call it that) for 4 hours and i moaned and kind of encouraged him by reciprocating it. 

i’m so ashamed. he was never caught. i told my parents that i was raped few weeks later.
my parents immediately made a police report and i went to therapy. i’m embarrassed to tell my therapist about this. i don’t feel like a woman. 

i hate myself. i even have the urge to masturbate to it sometimes.

i joined a SA victims group and i feel like i don’t deserve to be there because i encouraged the man to rape me. i was enjoying it which was why i orgasmed every single time. is this normal?","aylar önce tecavüze uğradım ben f

"We (27M 27F) have been dating for over 9 months now and I just found out that she has been lying to me about her daughter. I haven't told her about this yet because I don't want to confront her with high emotions. What do I do?

When we started dating I made sure that we establish what we want in this relationship and what we don't, especially about raising a family in the future. I told her am not yet ready emotionally and financially now but the idea of having children someday is welcome.

She always tells me stories of her older sister having a 4yo kid and how difficult it was to make her sisters ex cooperate with visitation and financial matters. Me being her partner, I always give her my best and honest opinion about what her sister could do about the situation. She also regularly sends me pictures and clips of her niece and I truly adore this kid, I even gave her a nice gift last Christmas.

A couple of months in being together, I started to notice irregularities like how she doesnt always have money to spend for our dates, not being available for certain days of the week, etc. I honestly did not mind since I understand that she may still have responsibilities at home.

Then a week ago I randomly borrowed her phone and saw her ex's name on top of her search bar. I did not ask her about it but my mind is already throwing a lot of questions. Why? Do they still communicate with each other?

Today I finally decided to browse through her ex's profile and found pictures of her 4yo niece with her ex as the profile photo. Went to the comments and saw comments saying ""congratulations [ex] &amp; [gf]!"". That's when I realized she has been lying to me about her sister. All the parenting difficulties she shared was hers. That's why her niece has been calling her mommy all this time.

I am totally furious right now. Please tell me what to do.

I'm just lost about this situation, because he is telling me that with me there is no other way and that he has to use physical strength to calm me down. I need someone else's opinion because it feels like i'm going crazy Is he being abusive or it's my fault for extreme emotions? I don't know what to think about myself, my self image is breaking. After he let go of the pillow I said ""what the fuck are you doing? Why?"" He said ""you see it worked, you stopped crying"" then I said"" you were hurting me, I couldn't breathe wtf"", he said that l'm being too dramatic and I didn't pass out. After that he sarcastically said that he is ""abuser"" and we should break up, after 5 minutes he said he didn't mean anything about that break up but now he feels like everything is his fault. A few years ago I had a bf who literally left bruises, I got out of that relationship and when I met my current bf, I showed him videos of my bruises and he knows how traumatazing it was back then, and now he is acting kinda the same way and still thinks that it's okay, it's okay to grab a fucking pillow and force it to my face and leave me without air for 5 seconds. He said that 5 seconds is not so much and I'm overreacting. I know that sometimes i Can be a little too much, but I don't think I deserved it.

UPDATE 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/kZ8zjPIdxW

Hi reddit, I’ve done my fair share of reading these but never thought I’d have to write one of these about myself or my own situation. I will try and keep this as short as possible but there’s a lot to cover. 

I am currently 30 weeks pregnant with my husband and I’s second baby (2 under 2 because we are young and careless), and I had been having severe symptoms of some sort of yeast infection or bacterial infection. I called my OB and asked if I could come in and get a swab because I had just run through a course of antibiotics and figured it caused an infection or imbalance. I got the test results back this morning and my OB informed me that I had an STD (I won’t specify which one for privacy reasons) and that it could have only been contracted through sex (not like a sat-on-a-sketchy-toilet-seat contracted). My heart instantly fell into my ass because I have had an extremely difficult and high risk pregnancy so we have been living with my parents (for the extra help) and only going back and forth to the doctors office 3 times a week so I have not been in the physical position to sleep with anyone else (also I’m not a total piece of shit and love my husband and could never fathom doing something like that). My husband has been incredible and so supportive during the entire pregnancy and has quite literally left my side only a handful of times in the past few months (because his job allows him to work from anywhere). 

Here is the kicker: I have been swabbed for BV, yeast infections, and this particular STD several times this entire pregnancy (my last one being a month ago) and everything has always come back negative. My first positive for this STD was the result I got back today. So it would have been in the past month or so that I got this. 

I have been cheated on before in the past and knew how to do all the precautionary things: I got ahold of his phone, laptop, and other devices to ensure I had everything in front of me that I needed. I checked every message, recently deleted folders, I literally checked every single app on those damn devices and he was CLEAN. Not a lick of proof or any sort of indicator of an affair. Bank statements, search history, app activity, app store downloads, call logs, fucking FACEBOOK MESSAGER and absolutely nothing. Normally, this would be a massive relief, but I still don’t know if I fully believe it. 

I have talked to him already and he had an extremely authentic sense of confusion and complete bewilderment that I had contracted this STD. I admit, I may be a bit of an AH for this, but I came into the conversation guns-a-blazing immediately demanding he fesses up to whatever or whoever he did. He instantly went into a complete state of shock and swore on his life that he would never and has never cheated on me. He started doing his own research seeing if there’s any way I could’ve caught it another way but even the internet says it’s extremely rare and unlikely (i.e. from damp or moldy towels, wet clothing, non sterile speculum/swab, or bacterial surfaces). He immediately said he wants to get tested himself to rule it out that he couldn’t have given me the STD (pertaining to I got it in a rare sort of freak accident way, not that I was cheating because to be quite honest, I haven’t been in the mood for sex as often and we are rarely having sex. I am home with my family all hours of the day and have not been allowed to drive/stay anywhere alone because I’m at high risk for strokes and the medication I am taking is not one where I can operate a vehicle so I am very obviously ruled out).

There are only 2 true scenarios where he a) could have been alone long enough to see someone and cheat and b) has been apart from me at all. The first scenario is when he went an hour away for a few hours for a work meeting. I have his location and it showed at the workplace and he drove the hour back immediately after he was done. The second scenario is when he went to his hometown to play a round of golf with one of his friends from high school, halfway through the round his friend’s girlfriend called and asked him to come home and he stayed to play the rest of the round “on his own.” He says he has people who can back his story that he was golfing alone because he ran into a family friend in the middle of the back 9 and he watched him play a hole or two. The only other time he is typically by himself is when he’s at the gym but my close relative owns the gym he goes to and has him coming and going from the gym on the cameras and he physically sees him come and go every time (it’s a small gym so it would be easy to see if he wasn’t really there). So I truly am trying to wrap my head around when he would have had time to cheat on me. I hear horror stories on here constantly so I know it’s not 100% ruled out, but other than the actual positive STD test, there really is no concrete evidence of an affair.

I went into my OB again today to get swabbed in hopes is was a terrible false positive, my OB is doubtful that it is a false positive because of how inflamed I am, but I’d rather get double the confirmation. 

He is persistent that he has never and would never cheat. Everything in me wants to believe him but it’s hard to believe it when science is backing the opposite. He is at the clinic getting swabbed now so we should have both of our results back by tomorrow. I plan on having a conversation when he does get home so I will update y’all when I have the chance to sit down and write it all out. I love my husband deeply and am still trying to wrap my mind around this. The thought of him with someone else and losing him as my best friend in the process makes me sick. I truly do not know what to do or where to go from here. I have given him every opportunity to fess up to an affair and he is still standing firm that he would never and has never cheated. At what point do I believe him or do I just throw away my whole marriage for this? And if it is some sort of freak accident how I got it, how do we move on from this? There are still so many things up in the air so I’m sure I’ll post an update when I’m able to get one, but I’d really just love some advice on what to do.

EDIT: Did not expect this to blow up. Reading through the comments and will make an update soon with more information! For right now, clarifying for everyone that the STD I had is not herpes. It’s trichomoniasis, it’s easily treatable and I am still doing active research and will be getting a second opinion to make sure I know all the facts. In the meantime, thank you for all of the comments/advice. Talk soon!","edit update has been posted on a separate post

düzenleme yorumları okurken bunun patlayacağını beklemiyordum ve yakında daha fazla bilgiyle bir güncelleme yapacağım, şu an için herkese açıklığa kavuşturacağım, sahip olduğum cinsel yolla bulaşan hastalığın herpes değil, trikomoniyazis olduğunu ve kolayca tedavi edilebileceğini ve hala aktif araştırma yaptığımı ve bu arada tüm gerçekleri bildiğimden emin olmak için ikinci bir görüş alacağım tüm yorumlar için teşekkür ederim, yakında görüşürüz"
"When I’m alone, I spend my time at home watching Netflix or YouTube, working out at home, draw, clean, shop and so on. 

On weekends, I spend my time with my husband going out on roadtrips, hiking, camping, shopping, and sometimes do short travels to different states if he has an extra day off.

Money is not an issue anymore. We both used to be broke. I worked 3 part-time jobs during community college, supporting both of us. He didn’t work at the time. Quickly, he got internships and a career making six figures. I didn’t have to work 3 jobs and found design job I enjoyed.

He told me my anxiety and stress is messing me up and that I should quit school and work. Luckily I finished my bachelor’s degree, but that was it… I never really moved further than this.

I’ve quit my job eventually. Been flying to different countries with husband, sometimes by months. I visited at least 15 different countries just this year. We’ve lived in different time zones all the time that I never ever saw my friends face or talk to them anymore.

I still lived everyday without any worries about money. 

Ok…so what? Now what?
I feel so…lifeless now.

I still enjoy doing photography stuff while I’m out, but that’s it. I stopped making things and I hate myself for it.

While I was in school, I had a full-time web designer job and got to do a little bit of game app development as freelance few years. I think that was my highlight moments when I was publishing few simple games I made myself.

I don’t know why but I haven’t been able to pickup my laptop or my tablet to code or even draw. I doodle now, but they’re just doodles…not real drawings.

I want to be a maker again and I’m not sure how. 

I miss working in a team. I miss making things. I miss those sleepless nights of working on projects…","yalnız olduğumda zamanımı evde netflix veya youtube izleyerek evde çalışarak resim çizerek temizlik yaparak alışveriş yaparak geçiriyorum

I treated her with respect, kindness, compassion I gave her things like flowers her favorite color or hand written notes. I feel like shit. I feel like she broke up with me because I couldn’t give her time sometimes because I go to school then work then if I can sleep. I don’t know what to do I need some advice on how to feel better. I just can’t right now. I don’t even know how I’m going to work through this.

I've tried to tell her about this in the past, but she and her husband (mainly him) laughed it off saying 'they are just kids.'

How do I go about telling her that if this happens again, that I'm taking my emergency key back but like...not as mean.

"About 3 years ago I was a little over 300 pounds. My dad weighed about the same and had a heart attack that nearly killed him and scared me shitless about my health. In the span of three years I’ve lost about 120 pounds and my health has improved drastically. One thing I didn’t account for was how I would be treated socially. When I was at my heaviest people barely looked my way. And now that I’m 180 pounds and toned things have completely changed. People smile at me, are kinder to me, people actually approach me now. That shit never happened when I was heavier. So now I can’t stop thinking, why are you worth my time? Would you have treated me like shit if I was heavier? Im not lonely because I still text my friends from high school 24/7, but I don’t connect with new people much anymore. How do I know they would like me for me, and wouldn’t have treated me like shit if I was 120 pounds heavier? I can’t shake the feeling that people are shallow and wouldn’t have liked the me of three years ago.",yaklaşık yıllar önce biraz fazla kiloluydum babam da aynı kilodaydı ve neredeyse onu öldüren bir kalp krizi geçirdi ve üç yıl içinde sağlığım konusunda çok korktum yaklaşık kilo verdim ve sağlığım önemli ölçüde düzeldi hesaba katmadığım bir şey en kilolu olduğumda sosyal olarak nasıl muamele göreceğimdi insanlar bana pek bakmıyordu ve şimdi kiloluyum ve fitim her şey tamamen değişti insanlar bana gülümsüyor bana karşı daha nazik insanlar bana yaklaşıyor şimdi daha kiloluyken böyle şeyler hiç olmadı bu yüzden şimdi neden zamanıma değdiğini düşünmeden edemiyorum daha kilolu olsaydım bana bok gibi davranır mıydın yalnız değilim çünkü liseden arkadaşlarıma hala mesaj atıyorum ama artık yeni insanlarla pek iletişim kurmuyorum beni olduğum gibi seveceklerini ve daha kilolu olsaydım bana bok gibi davranmayacaklarını nasıl bilebilirim insanların sığ olduğu ve üç yıl önceki halimi sevmeyecekleri hissinden kurtulamıyorum
"I’m 18f. I just turned 18 in June. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been shamed for having saggy breasts. For measurements and reference sake, I’m 5’4, 180 pounds and wear a 38-48 D/DD. My nipples face downwards. I’m not in denial that they’re saggy – I know they are – I just absolutely hate them for it. Even my closest friends and own family have made jokes and jabs about how my boobs shouldn’t be saggy at my age and yet, they are. It’s become an obsession. Everytime I look in the mirror, I lift my shirt up and start to tear up at my saggy breasts with downward facing nipples.

Growing up online, I’ve been exposed to lots of pornographic content and fake bodies and I’m aware most breasts don’t typically look like that in real life, but it’s hard not to compare myself to big boobs that are still perky.

I find myself looking at every other woman’s boobs. Not in a sexual way, but in a way, “Do their breasts look like mines as well?” and I feel myself spiraling into self hatred every time I see a woman with large breasts that are still perky.

I’ve been planning to exercise in hopes that it’ll help make them firm again, or at least help me lose enough weight where the sag won’t be as noticeable. If that doesn’t work, I’m incredibly set on getting a breast lift. I want to have children and breastfeed in the future, but my self hatred for my breasts is so bad that I would rather sacrifice my long term dream of being a mother for the chance to feel desirable and attractive.

I find myself always thinking of my breasts at every given second. I’m always checking how they look. It’s gotten to the point where I research plastic surgery clinics near me 24/7 and look at other women for even a bit of hope that maybe my breasts can still be desirable to someone.

I feel completely unattractive. Hideous. I’m firm in my belief that no man will ever want to see me naked, love me, marry me or have children with me because my breasts aren’t perky and desirable.

Does anyone have any advice for how to work through this self loathing? It’s been years and it’s only getting worse and worse. I don’t have access to therapy, so that’s not a question. I would love to experience breastfeeding but with how much I hate my breasts, I’m ready to give up that dream whenever I get enough money for surgery.

I guess I’d just like to know if there’s any other women struggling with this, especially women in happy relationships, and how you overcame this self hatred? Does anyone have any advice or tips that could help me begin to love my breasts better? Any and all (genuine) advice is welcome.

Thank you.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the lovely comments 💗 i’ve read them all and appreciate every single one of you!! (that left genuine advice and didn’t say anything stupid / tried to offend me lol). i’ve been going through and screenshotting all the wonderful advice and adding it to a folder when times get hard. nobody has to comment on this anymore. if you’d still like to, feel free!! but all the comments from ppl experiencing the same thing as me but still finding a partner who loves their flaws has made me hopeful! p.s: idk if this needed to be stated but this was not an invite to ask for nudes lol. don’t do that???

p.s.s: special shoutout to the person that mentioned nipples are meant to be downturned to breastfeed babies 💝 i’m not sure if that’s a fact or not, but every time I feel self conscious again, I’ll definitely remember that information :) most of you have been very kind and i appreciate that!! thank you all so much!

another edit: holy shit i didn’t think i should have to preference this but don’t fatshame me?? i’m AWARE i’m overweight, believe it or not lol. i’m on an active diet and work out as well. believe it or not, the weight doesn’t magically disappear! i’ve lost 60+ LBS and counting. plz focus on the actual discussion and not the weight i’m actively losing, thxs! don’t assume you know everything about everyone :) i’m working on losing the weight.","ben haziran ayında yeni doğdum hatırladığım kadarıyla ölçü ve referans uğruna sarkık göğüslerim olduğu için utandırıldım kiloluyum ve ddd takıyorum meme uçlarım aşağı bakıyor sarkık olduklarını inkar etmiyorum biliyorum öyleler sadece bundan nefret ediyorum en yakın arkadaşlarım ve ailem bile göğüslerimin benim yaşımda sarkık olmaması gerektiğiyle ilgili şakalar ve laf sokmalar yaptı ama sarkıklar bu bir takıntı haline geldi aynaya her baktığımda tişörtümü yukarı kaldırıp sarkık göğüslerime ağlamaya başlıyorum aşağı bakan meme uçları

"My boyfriend and I tried to have sex for the first time (first for me, not for him) and when he was inserting himself, he said he couldn't get it in fully because there was some sort of resistance.

It was also terribly painful on my end and I already expected that to happen but for some reason, my body involuntarily ""closes up"" and ""blocks"" him even though I don't want it to.

I'm 100 percent sure that I wanted to be intimate with him and I kept assuring him that I want him. 

I just don't know why my body is resisting him even if mentally, emotionally I was prepared for it? Is there something wrong with me? Why can't I lose my virginity? Is there anything I can do? Please help. ","erkek arkadaşım ve ben ilk defa seks yapmaya çalıştık, önce benim için, onun için değil ve kendini soktuğunda, bir tür direnç olduğu için tam olarak yapamadığını söyledi

"Hey y'all, f18. So as the title says, my parents saw my nudes. They were my JUST titties, but they're going crazy about it. My mom found it on my phone, and decided to show my dad. They decided to take the pictures and send it to themselves so they can show my grandparents. Meanwhile, I move to college next week and my grandparents are the ones who are buying me my things for moving. I'm just tired of them, mad at them, and feel very self conscious now. I couldn't play it down as an accident since they were like top notch lmao (sorry y'all, im just trying to lighten it up) but yeah.

Update: They asked if im at least making money from it which is insanely inappropriate, and made me feel so uncomfortable.

Another update: For the ones saying it's made up, keep it to yourself. I'm over here staying at a friends house now because it progressed.

Some of yall are trifling, i dont give a fuck who sees them, i have a whole OF. But who's the one posting them. ME. And i know what's being said about it. If it's not your picture, and you went into the persons friend, and then tries to show other people, that WRONG. Now if they found my OF, that's different.

"I was on Facebook and a woman I knew while I was in the army popped up on my “people you may know” list. She was someone I had a one night stand with, but she ended up getting into a relationship with a guy who I also knew shortly after. In her profile picture she was with a kid…who has a striking resemblance to me. She and her now husband have brown eyes, brown hair, and downward pointing noses. The child and I have blue eyes, blond curly hair, upturned noses, and very similar eyebrows and ears. I saw that his birthday was in August of 2015.
I happen to have photos that I took while on a date with her same day we had sex, and they say that they were taken in November of 2014. 9 months before his birthday. 

He would be 8 years old now.

Two years ago I caught her daughter with another girl when I came home from work. She begged me not to tell her mom so I didn't. It's not my place to discuss her sexuality.  
  
Yesterday her daughter came home from school with a girl and came out to her mom. She flew into this rage and started cussing and calling her daughter names. And then she kicked her out and told her not to come back till she's ""normal"".  
  
My fiancee is very Christian. So to her being gay is a sin. I tried to reason with her but she doesn't care. She doesn't want to see her daughter again.  
  
Her daughter went to stay with her girlfriend and her parents. I've been in contact with her and told her I'd try to persuade her mom to let her back in. But I don't see that happening.

İki yıl önce işten eve geldiğimde kızını başka bir kızla yakaladım, annesine söylememem için yalvardı, bu yüzden söylemedim, onun cinselliğini tartışmak benim işim değil

"So as the title says my fiancée still talks to and hangs out with her ex . When me and her got together she was coming out of a relationship with her ex and they were on terrible terms and weren’t speaking anymore. They shared a dog but for months the ex never saw the dog or spoke with my fiancée . It wasn’t until the ex came back from a trip that they started communicating so that he could see the dog . That was also around the same time that me and my fiancée got into the biggest argument we had ever had and when we started arguing the first person she called was him . She cried and vented to him about our relationship and told me that because I’m messing up she should be allowed to have her friend back. Being that I was in a pickle I decided to compromise . I hate the fact that they are getting closer and closer everyday . At one point it was them texting back and forth to see when would be a good day to pick up the dog. It has now escalated in 4 months to them sharing locations , calling all times of the night and her going to parties with him and not inviting me . These last 4 months have been rather difficult because I am uncomfortable at their relationship . I’ve expressed myself multiple times and also stated that I would prefer that she limited talking with him but that then in turn came with more backlash and arguments. The past couple of weeks have been nothing but mentionings of him and how they used to do things. Now she wants me to go on a trip with him and his friends and I told her I wasn’t comfortable. I’m sorry for rambling but the straw that broke my back was last night. We both worked last night and had plans to study together and cuddle to watch movies and make dinner. On her way home she gets a text from him saying that he is having a celebration for his fraternity and he wants her to come and bring somebody with her . She shows me the messages and immediately tells me that I need to study so she’ll be bringing her other friend along so it’ll be those two instead. She completely drops our plans and makes new ones to go hang out with him . I was clearly upset and asked her to stay home but she said that her friend really wanted her to go so she went . She left home at 12am and didn’t return until 2:40am . At this point I’m done , I felt abandoned and when I expressed myself she insisted that we weren’t going to do this tonight and she’d rather sleep at her friends house instead . She did come back home but was drunk and out of it. I don’t know what to do anymore , should I leave or should we try to work it out ? She also stated weeks ago that she would never want to live a life without her ex which is now her friend . 

Edit/Update: Thank you all for your answers to my scenario . Everyone on here was absolutely right and I did find out the next day after I posted this that she went and fucked her ex right after we “broke up” that morning. We are also both young just to add more detail , im a 24 year old female and she is a 21 year old female 
This has been the most heartbreak experience I’ve ever had to live through and I know you all asked why I stayed well it’s because I brought her out of state to my friend at the time’s house . My friend and I had been cool for 9 years and had a 3 month relationship when we were in high school that was sexual . We have been out of school for 6 years and I never brought it up to her but she found out we had a relationship after observing how we acted together . 
Regardless what I did (mind you this was months ago) I truly don’t feel I deserved this . I thought she and her ex could be friends but never wanted it to escalate to this .. thank you all ! ","başlıkta da yazdığı gibi nişanlım hala eski sevgilisiyle konuşuyor ve onunla takılıyor, ben ve nişanlım bir araya geldiğimizde eski sevgilisiyle ilişkisinden yeni çıkıyordu ve çok kötü bir ilişkileri vardı ve artık konuşmuyorlardı, bir köpekleri vardı ama aylarca eski sevgilim köpeği hiç görmedi veya nişanlımla konuşmadı, eski sevgilim bir seyahatten dönene kadar iletişim kurmadılar, böylece köpeği görebildi ve bu da nişanlımla aramızdaki en büyük tartışmanın yaşandığı zamana denk geldi ve tartışmaya başladığımızda aradığı ilk kişi oydu, ağladı ve ilişkimiz hakkında ona dert yandı ve bana işleri berbat ettiğim için arkadaşını geri almasına izin verilmesi gerektiğini söyledi, çünkü zor durumdaydım, uzlaşmaya karar verdim, her gün daha da yakınlaşmalarından nefret ediyorum, bir noktada köpeği almak için iyi bir gün ne zaman olacağını görmek için ileri geri mesajlaşıyorlardı, şimdi aylar içinde yerleri paylaşmaya, gecenin her saati aramaya ve nişanlımın onunla partilere gitmesine ve beni davet etmemesine kadar tırmandı, son aylar oldukça zordu çünkü rahatsızım İlişkilerinde kendimi defalarca ifade ettim ve ayrıca onunla konuşmasını sınırlamasını tercih ettiğimi söyledim ama bu da daha fazla tepki ve tartışmaya yol açtı. Geçtiğimiz birkaç hafta sadece ondan ve eskiden nasıl yaptıklarından bahsetti, şimdi benimle onun ve arkadaşlarıyla bir geziye çıkmamı istiyor ve ona rahat olmadığımı söyledim, saçmaladığım için özür dilerim ama sırtımı kıran saman çöpü dün gece ikimizin de dün gece çalışmamız ve birlikte ders çalışmayı, film izlemeyi ve eve giderken akşam yemeği yapmayı planlamamızdı. Ondan kardeşliği için bir kutlama yaptığını ve onun gelip birini getirmesini istediğini söyleyen bir mesaj aldı. Bana mesajları gösterdi ve hemen çalışmam gerektiğini, bu yüzden diğer arkadaşını da getireceğini, böylece bunun yerine ikisinin olacağını söyledi. Planlarımızı tamamen iptal etti ve onunla takılmak için yeni planlar yaptı. Açıkça üzgündüm ve evde kalmasını istedim ama arkadaşının gerçekten gitmesini istediğini söyledi ve gitti. Sabah evden çıktı ve sabaha kadar dönmedi. Bu noktada bitti. Kendimi terk edilmiş hissettim ve kendimi ifade ettiğimde gitmeyeceğimizde ısrar etti. bunu bu gece yapıp arkadaşının evinde uyumayı tercih etti eve döndü ama sarhoştu ve kendinde değildi artık ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum gitmeli miyim yoksa çözmeye mi çalışmalıyız ayrıca haftalar önce eski sevgilisi olmadan asla bir hayat yaşamak istemediğini söyledi ki eski sevgilisi artık arkadaşı

düzenlegüncelle senaryoma verdiğiniz cevaplar için hepinize teşekkür ederim buradaki herkes kesinlikle haklıydı ve bunu yayınladıktan sonraki gün öğrendim o sabah ayrıldıktan hemen sonra gidip eski sevgilisiyle seviştiğini ikimiz de genciz sadece daha fazla ayrıntı eklemek için ben bir yaşında bir kızım ve o da bir yaşında bir kız
bu şimdiye kadar yaşadığım en yürek parçalayıcı deneyimdi ve hepinizin neden iyi kaldığımı sorduğunu biliyorum çünkü onu eyaletin dışına, Times House'daki arkadaşıma götürdüm arkadaşımla yıllardır iyi anlaşıyorduk ve lisedeyken bir aylık bir ilişkimiz oldu bu cinsel bir ilişkiydi yıllardır okuldan uzaktayız ve bunu ona hiç açmadım ama birlikte nasıl davrandığımızı gözlemledikten sonra bir ilişkimiz olduğunu öğrendi
ne yaparsam yapayım aklınızda bulunsun bu aylardı gerçekten bunu hak ettiğimi düşünmüyorum onun ve eski sevgilisinin arkadaş olabileceğini düşündüm ama bunun bu noktaya gelmesini hiç istemedim hepinize teşekkür ederim"

**Recap of the situation leading to this update:**

I became suspicious of my wife after she started making strange comments about a 17-year-old boy she coaches in soccer. When I confronted her, she became defensive and lashed out. After going through her phone, I discovered that she’s likely been having an affair with the boy’s father. Initially, I felt a sense of relief that it wasn’t a predatory situation, but I was also overwhelmed with grief and betrayal, realizing that my wife had been unfaithful.

**Update:**

First off, I just want to thank you all for your support and patience through this difficult time. Unfortunately, my most recent update was removed, so I reposted it, but that was then locked so I haven’t been able to reply to any comments or make any edits to the actual post.

Now before the update I also need to admit something that I lied about in my last update. I said I got records from our shared phone provider, but the truth is, I actually went through her phone. I was nervous about admitting this on here and worried about potential consequences. But in retrospect, I feel I had good enough reason to check, and the phone was purchased using our shared bank account, which could give me a valid claim for accessing it. If it counts for anything, I did try to contact our shared service provider, but they told me they don’t give out any specific personal information (this includes messages) to anyone but the police, for security and confidentiality reasons.

When looking through her messages with ""Hot soccer dad"", the same name kept coming up and it became clear that this was the kid. The messages made it quite obvious who it was as they were often using the kid as an excuse to stay in contact. The conversations were overly flirty, and it was quite obvious that something was going on between the two of them. On top of this, it looks like they have met up several times for coffee after practice. I don’t know where the kid goes in that time, as there is still no mention of his mother, and I still don’t know much about the kid’s family situation.

With all that said, I’m relieved to say that things are finally moving forward. I decided to meet with a divorce attorney who has been fantastic and am in the process of finalising everything. I’m now set up in a temporary apartment with a separate bank account. It was surprisingly easy to open, and I regret not doing it earlier, the freedom it’s given me has been a massive weight off my shoulders. I’m not naïve anymore and I have no intention of dragging this out but know things may still get complicated. Though, after a lot of stress and uncertainty I’m finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and it’s a relief to think shell soon be out of my life.

The last real piece of bad news in this update. Her family, especially her sister, is fully aware of the situation but has chosen to side with her. I’ve never been the biggest fan of her sister to be completely honest, but never to this extent. I’ve been receiving aggressive messages from her sister, calling me selfish and threatening to ensure my wife “gets everything.” They’ve even implied that they use their family’s financial resources to back her legally as they’re well off and have offered to cover her costs. To add to this there are some legal loopholes regarding out shared assets, including the house, which could mean I have a lot more to lose in this than I expected.

This has been a humbling and, in some ways, eye-opening experience. I always assumed infidelity – or these kinds of situations – would be easy to spot. I never expected to be blindsided by my own partner, someone I loved and trusted completely. I realize now that betrayal doesn’t fit into near categories or follow obvious patterns. Although this situation didn’t turn out to be the predatory relationship I feared, it shown me that anyone – male or female – can be vulnerable to this kind of manipulation.

With the court date likely coming up in the next couple months and the divorce process underway, it feels like I’m nearing the end of this exhausting chapter. I’m incredibly grateful for all the support and insight I’ve received here. it’s been a strange few weeks, but I’m determined to close this chapter and start fresh. I’ll keep sharing updates as things progress, though I don’t foresee too many more developments.

Thank you again for being there. I know I can’t respond to everyone, but your encouragement has meant a lot and given me the courage to keep on fighting.

Oh, and one more thing I forgot to add - I reconnected with my brother and shared everything about what’s been happening. Thankfully, he was really glad I reached out, and he’s actually planning to come visit at the end of the year. I’m really looking forward to it; I’ve missed him a lot since we last saw each other during the difficult time of our mother’s passing.

Since this is the r/advice subreddit, I still need to ask for advice so: Can anyone give me any advice on how to get through a tricky divorce? Has anyone else been through anything similar to this? What is the best way to move on with my life?

"Yesterday I learned that my 3yo son got out of the house, crossed the street and went INTO our neighbors home and was found sitting butt naked on their couch by their son at 9am on a Monday morning. I am a nurse and was at work, my husband was watching our son. Typically I work weekends and my mom helps my husband with our son in the mornings. The neighbors whose house he went into have 4 other kids, they just moved in. Our kids played together once outside so they had an idea of who this child in their home was but got another neighbor to help bring him home. My husband didn’t answer at first as he was still in the shower. But eventually did and collected our son. 

If this story isn’t horrifying enough-my husband did not tell me this happened. Nope, 8 days later and a few weird looks from this family-our kids were playing together outside. And finally the Mom must have picked up that I had no idea and told me everything. I was holding back tears, fury and a panic attack as she told me. I’ve never been more embarrassed in my life. 

The seriousness of this situation isn’t lost on me. Between sex trafficking, my son potentially being hit by a car or drowning in the river near our home-police getting involved and children and youth investigating us, I feel paralyzed by this happening. 

When I confronted my husband he started telling me it “wasn’t a big deal” and “I told you.” I said how dare you try to gaslight me. All he said to me the other day was you can’t leave **kids name** downstairs while you shower. He can unlock the door. 

I plan on getting the neighbors and gift card and writing a long letter of thanks to them. I know how lucky we are this didn’t go catastrophically bad. 

What a fucking shit show. How would you feel if your husband kept this from you? I can’t even look at him. 


I had to come back and edit this-turns out my POS mid 30’s husband was having an affair with a 22 yo. Hence the distraction. Didn’t see it then but the lies were just beginning.

eğer bu hikaye yeterince korkunç değilse kocam bana bunun olduğunu söylemedi hayır günler sonra ve bu aileden birkaç garip bakış çocuklarımız dışarıda birlikte oynuyorlardı ve sonunda anne benim hiçbir fikrim olmadığını anlamış olmalı ve bana her şeyi anlattı gözyaşlarımı tutuyordum öfke ve panik atak bana söylediğinde hayatımda hiç bu kadar utanmamıştım

bu durumun ciddiyetini, oğlumun potansiyel olarak seks ticaretiyle karşı karşıya kalması arasında fark etmiyorum evimizin yakınındaki nehirde araba çarpması veya boğulma polisin dahil olması ve çocukların ve gençlerin bizi soruşturması bu olaydan dolayı felç olmuş gibi hissediyorum

kocamla yüzleştiğimde bana bunun önemli bir şey olmadığını söylemeye başladı ve sana nasıl bana gaz vermeye cesaret ettiğini söyledim geçen gün bana söylediği tek şey duş alırken çocukların ismini aşağıda bırakamayacağındı kapıyı açabilirdi

komşulardan hediye kartı alıp onlara uzun bir teşekkür mektubu yazmayı planlıyorum ne kadar şanslı olduğumuzu biliyorum bu felaketle sonuçlanmadı

ne boktan bir gösteri kocanız bunu sizden saklasa ne hissederdiniz ona bile bakamıyorum

geri dönüp bunu düzenlemek zorunda kaldımmeğerse pos mid s kocam bir yo ile ilişki yaşıyormuş bu yüzden dikkat dağıtıcı o zaman fark etmemiş ama yalanlar daha yeni başlıyormuş"
"Today my dad was driving me home from a sports event. The school I was playing at was about an hour and a half away from home, so I fell asleep on the ride home. Usually I’ll stay knocked out the whole time, but I left my earbuds in while I slept and a particularly loud song woke me up. I took my earbuds out and almost went back to sleep when I noticed my dad’s right arm was moving kind of weird. I couldn’t see what was happening because I was sitting in the seat right behind him so I assumed it was moving like that because the road we were driving on was bumpy. Then we got onto paved roads and it was still happening, that’s when I got suspicious. I was joking in my head that he was jacking off because I thought it was super unrealistic. Who would jack off in the car while their kid was in there too? But then he switched hands, and I knew what was happening. I tried to think logically and believe someone would never do something like that, until he parked the car and picked up an empty Starbucks cup…
What finally convinced me was when he dumped the contents of the cup outside of the car and continued driving.
I told a friend about this already and when she asked if I was okay I realized that what happened was really fucking weird.
Anyways I guess what I’m asking is should I tell my mother about this and is what happened super fucked up or should I let it go?? I’m neurodivergent so I often have trouble figuring out my emotions and deciding what I think is right and wrong. I’m a minor by the way, if that changes anything.

TLDR: My dad jacked off in the car while I was there too and I don’t know how to feel or who to tell if I should tell anyone at all.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your advice and support! I told my mother. She was very receptive and told me she will talk to my father today, hopefully all goes well. My parents already have a kinda broken relationship (my dad has expressed several times in words that he no longer wanted to be in a relationship with my mom), so I’m kind of scared about what’s going to happen. I’ll keep you guys updated.

EDIT 2: To all the people saying this is a « fetish post » or whatever y’all are calling it, that’s disgusting and I would never fantasize about that. I hate incest and I DESPISE pedophilia, I’ve literally thrown up thinking about what happened. I’ve fucking locked myself in my room since I got home from school because I can’t stand to be around my dad right now. If you don’t believe me, then don’t waste your time telling me so.

SMALL UPDATE: I asked my mom if she confronted my dad about it. She said she didn’t believe he was actually masturbating. She has a habit of not clearly answering my questions to try to avoid them, so I asked her again if she confronted him. She said she talked to him twice about it. I had to ask what he said twice because she wouldn’t answer, she told me he said he didn’t believe that happened?? Which doesn’t make sense because he was there, he was the one doing it, so he either knows he did it or knows he didn’t do it. My mom gets avoidant when she lies and it was very obvious to me that she lied about having confronted him. He was home from work today and not once did he seem off or mentioned what happened. I know that when my father fucks up, he gets really distant and/or gets angry and accusatory. So basically she most likely lied to me. I’m going to press her about it tomorrow.

FINAL UPDATE (probably): I’m so sick of this situation so I’m going to try to make this short. My mom still doesn’t believe me. I pressed her about talking to my dad yesterday and she started getting angry and yelling. She claims to have talked to my dad about it three times but when I asked her what she said to him, she said she asked him if he peed in a cup. And understandably, he was confused. She obviously has no intention of ever really asking him because when it comes down to it, she’ll always believe my father over me no matter what. I’m honestly just so done right now. Thankfully I’ll be leaving home in a few years and I have no intention of coming back because this is one of the least fucked up things that have happened to me here. Thank you all for your kind words and support.","bugün babam beni bir spor etkinliğinden eve götürüyordu oynadığım okul evden yaklaşık bir buçuk saat uzaktaydı bu yüzden eve giderken uyuyakaldım genelde sürekli uykuda kalırım ama uyurken kulaklıklarımı takmıştım ve özellikle yüksek sesli bir şarkı beni uyandırdı kulaklıklarımı çıkardım ve neredeyse tekrar uyuyacaktım ki babamın sağ kolunun hareket ettiğini fark ettim biraz garip ne olduğunu göremedim çünkü hemen arkasındaki koltukta oturuyordum bu yüzden hareket ettiğini varsaydım çünkü sürdüğümüz yol engebeliydi sonra asfalt yola girdik ve hala devam ediyordu o zaman şüphelendim kafamda onun mastürbasyon yaptığını düşünüyordum çünkü çocukları da arabadayken kimin arabada mastürbasyon yapacağı çok gerçek dışıydı ama sonra ellerini değiştirdi ve ne olduğunu anladım mantıklı düşünmeye çalıştım ve birinin asla böyle bir şey yapmayacağına inanmaya çalıştım ta ki arabayı park edip boş bir Starbucks bardağı alana kadar
sonunda beni ikna eden şey bardağın içindekileri arabanın dışına döküp devam etmesiydi sürüş
bundan bir arkadaşıma bahsettim ve iyi olup olmadığımı sorduğunda olanların gerçekten çok garip olduğunu fark ettim
neyse, sanırım sormak istediğim şey anneme bundan bahsetmeli miyim ve olan biten çok mu berbat yoksa boşvermeli miyim nörodiverjanım bu yüzden duygularımı anlamakta ve neyin doğru neyin yanlış olduğuna karar vermekte sık sık sorun yaşıyorum bu arada ben küçüğüm bu bir şeyi değiştirirse

kısa özet: babam da ben oradayken arabada mastürbasyon yaptı ve ne hissedeceğimi veya kime söyleyeceğimi bilmiyorum, eğer birine söylemeliysem

düzenleme tavsiyeleriniz ve desteğiniz için hepinize teşekkür ederim anneme söyledim çok anlayışlıydı ve bugün babamla konuşacağını söyledi umarım her şey yolunda gider ailemle ilişkimiz zaten biraz bozuk babam birkaç kez annemle artık ilişki istemediğini kelimelerle ifade etti bu yüzden ne olacağından korkuyorum sizi güncel tutacağım

düzenleme bunun bir fetiş gönderisi olduğunu veya her ne diyorsanız iğrenç olduğunu söyleyen herkese ve asla böyle bir fantezi kurmam nefret ediyorum ensest ve pedofiliden nefret ediyorum olanları düşününce kelimenin tam anlamıyla kustum okuldan eve geldiğimden beri kendimi odama kilitledim çünkü şu an babamın yanında olmaya dayanamıyorum eğer inanmıyorsanız bana bunu anlatarak zaman kaybetmeyin

küçük güncelleme anneme babamla yüzleşip yüzleşmediğini sordum mastürbasyon yaptığına inanmadığını söyledi sorularımı yanıtlamamak için net cevaplar vermeme alışkanlığı var bu yüzden ona tekrar sorup yüzleşip yüzleşmediğini sordum onunla iki kez konuştuğunu söyledi ne dediğini iki kez sormak zorunda kaldım çünkü cevap vermedi bana inanmadığını söyledi bu mantıklı değil çünkü oradaydı bunu yapan oydu bu yüzden ya yaptığını biliyor ya da yapmadığını biliyor annem yalan söylediğinde kaçınmacı oluyor ve onunla yüzleştiği konusunda yalan söylediği bana çok açıktı bugün işten eve geldi ve bir kez bile ilgisiz görünmedi ya da olanlardan bahsetmedi babam hata yaptığında çok uzaklaştığını ve/veya sinirlenip suçlayıcı davrandığını biliyorum bu yüzden temelde büyük ihtimalle bana yalan söyledi yarın ona bu konuda baskı yapacağım

son güncelleme muhtemelen bu durumdan çok sıkıldım bu yüzden bunu kısa tutmaya çalışacağım annem hala bana inanmıyor dün babamla konuşmam konusunda ona baskı yaptım ve sinirlenmeye ve bağırmaya başladı babamla bu konuda üç kez konuştuğunu iddia ediyor ama ona ne dediğini sorduğumda ona bir bardağa işeyip işemediğini sorduğunu söyledi ve anlaşılabilir bir şekilde kafası karışmıştı belli ki ona asla gerçekten sormaya niyeti yok çünkü işin aslına bakarsanız ne olursa olsun babama her zaman benden daha çok inanır dürüst olmak gerekirse şu anda çok mutluyum birkaç yıl içinde evden ayrılacağım ve geri dönmeyi düşünmüyorum çünkü bu başıma gelen en az berbat şeylerden biri bu nazik sözleriniz ve desteğiniz için hepinize teşekkür ederim"
"I work 40+ hours a week, I lucked out and have a job where I can play video games and be working kinf so I get in no trouble.. other than with her.

She tells me I’m immature and childish for not being able to give up games because I should be paying attention to our son. If I could take my son to work, I would. 

I don’t play games at home, I removed all of my consoles, turned my pc off and only use it for business(which is rare). 

I don’t get to talk to her about it, she just considers it arguing and that I’m proving her points. I just have a job being stuck in a room for over 8 hours and bring my switch/laptop to play and pass the time. I’m not sure what to do. I’m assuming nothing to do since I can’t even speak to her about it. 

Apologies if this isn’t the right place to post this. I’m truly not sure where to go with any of this. Therapy yes lol but will that happen? I doubt it. I’m just trying to be there for my son man","Haftada saatlerce çalışıyorum, şanslıyım ve video oyunları oynayabileceğim ve çalışabileceğim bir işim var, bu yüzden onun dışında başım belaya girmiyor

Oğluma dikkat etmem gerektiği için oyunlardan vazgeçemediğim için olgunlaşmamış ve çocuksu olduğumu söylüyor, eğer oğlumu işe götürebilseydim, oğlumla ilgilenirdim

Evde oyun oynamıyorum, tüm konsollarımı çıkardım, bilgisayarımı kapattım ve sadece iş için kullanıyorum, ki bu nadirdir

Onunla bu konuda konuşamıyorum, bunu sadece tartışma olarak görüyor ve onun fikirlerini kanıtladığımı düşünüyor, sadece bir işim var, saatlerce bir odada sıkışıp kalıyorum ve zaman geçirmek için Switch dizüstü bilgisayarımı getiriyorum, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, onunla bu konuda konuşamadığım için hiçbir şey yapmadığımı varsayıyorum

"I recently started a new job since I had been laid off for a year. My husband and I have been together for 5 years and I can probably count on two hands how many times he has cooked for us. Throughout our entire relationship I have cooked. Prepping meals. Grocery shopping. All of it. Well since I started a new job, my commute is an hour and sometimes even an hour and a half long. 

I would leave for work at 6am-7am and I won’t get back home until 6pm-6:20pm. I wake up to go to the gym at 4:30am. My job is more taxing on my body. My husband however works from home and he has a desk job. So I asked him if he can start cooking for us on the week days because by the time I get home, get settled, cook, eat and shower, it’s like 9pm and I need to be asleep no later than 9:30pm. And since I started the job, I have been cooking late/eating late which causes me to wake up and my stomach is hurting really bad and I’m nauseous. The food doesn’t have time to digest. 

Well today was the first day of our new routine of him cooking. I get home about 6pm and I see him in the kitchen prepping the food. I haven’t ate all day because I am cramping really bad. He knows I haven’t been feeling good the last few days. So I go to take a shower and I lay down on top of our bed because it’s the only comfortable position. From my understanding when I walked into the house, I saw him in the kitchen preparing the food so I’m thinking the food should be ready soon. 

Well I come out 2 hours later I haven’t heard from him. I ask my husband hey is the food ready yet since I hadn’t heard from him. He says he stopped cooking because he expected me to come to the living room area. I’m not sure why he wanted me out in the living room as a signal for him to keep cooking. At this point it’s too late for me to even eat because I’m already in pain and I know if I eat right now (an hour before bed) then I’ll wake up in even more pain. So we get into an argument and he is saying I am gaslighting him and that he is tired and just being very cold and he is just being completely not empathetic to the point that I am exhausted, in pain and tired from my long commute. 

He then ask me to come into the kitchen so I can take a look at the food to see if he is making it right. At that point I was fed up. I’m crying. I told him that it hurts to even walk right now so why would you ask me to get up and watch you cook. He says “I am trying to help you out” 

I make his plate for him every night and I bring it to him. I ask just one favor for him to cook. I’m so tired.  I told him I’m better off single because when I lived alone and I was in pain, at least I knew I could only rely on myself. I didn’t have someone being mean to me as well. I decide that I’m better off just going to bed without eating. Any advice? 

Edit: he got me chocolates this morning and said he was sorry I wasn’t feeling good. As for the people saying to stop and get food on my way home. I definitely will today because I’m craving McDonald’s hehe. ","yeni bir işe başladım çünkü bir yıldır işten çıkarıldım kocam ve ben yıllardır birlikteyiz ve ilişkimiz boyunca kaç kez bizim için yemek yaptığını muhtemelen iki elimle sayabilirim yemek yaptım yemek hazırladım yemek alışverişi yaptım hepsini yeni bir işe başladığımdan beri işe gidiş gelişlerim bir saat hatta bazen bir buçuk saat sürüyor

işe gitmek için amam'dan çıkıyordum ve eve ancak akşam 1'de spor salonuna gitmek için uyanıyorum işim vücudumu daha çok yoruyor ancak kocam evden çalışıyor ve masa başı bir işi var bu yüzden ona hafta içi bizim için yemek yapmaya başlayıp başlayamayacağını sordum çünkü eve geldiğimde yerleşip yemek pişirip duş almam gerekiyor ve en geç akşam 1'de uyumam gerekiyor ve işe başladığımdan beri geç yemek pişiriyorum geç yemek yiyorum bu da uyanmama neden oluyor ve midem çok ağrıyor ve midem bulanıyor yemeğin sindirilmesi için zaman olmuyor

bugün onun yemek pişirme rutinimizin ilk günüydü akşam 1 civarı eve geliyorum ve onu evde görüyorum mutfak bütün gün yemediğim yemeği hazırlıyor çünkü çok kötü kramplarım var son birkaç gündür kendimi iyi hissetmediğimi biliyor bu yüzden duş almaya gidiyorum ve yatağımızın üstüne uzanıyorum çünkü anladığım kadarıyla tek rahat pozisyon bu eve girdiğimde onu mutfakta yemek hazırlarken gördüm bu yüzden yemeğin yakında hazır olacağını düşünüyorum

peki saatler sonra dışarı çıktım ondan haber alamadım kocama sordum yemek hazır mı henüz ondan haber alamadığım için yemek yapmayı bıraktığını söyledi çünkü oturma odasına gelmemi bekliyordu neden beni oturma odasına çağırdığını bilmiyorum bu noktada yemek yapmaya devam etmesi için bir işaret olarak yemek yemek için bile çok geç çünkü zaten ağrım var ve eğer yatmadan bir saat önce yemek yersem daha da fazla ağrıyla uyanacağımı biliyorum bu yüzden tartışıyoruz ve ona gaz verdiğimi ve yorgun olduğunu ve çok üşüdüğünü ve uzun yolculuğumdan dolayı bitkin ve yorgun olduğum noktaya kadar tamamen empatik olmadığını söylüyor

sonra bana sordu mutfağa girip yemeğe bir göz atıp doğru yapıp yapmadığını görmek için o noktada bıkmıştım ağlıyordum ona şu anda yürümenin bile acı verdiğini söyledim o zaman neden kalkıp seni yemek yaparken izlememi istiyorsun o sana yardım etmeye çalıştığımı söylüyor

her gece onun için tabak hazırlıyorum ve ona götürüyorum ondan sadece bir iyilik istiyorum yemek pişirmesi için çok yorgunum ona bekar olmanın daha iyi olduğunu söyledim çünkü yalnız yaşadığımda ve acı çektiğimde en azından sadece kendime güvenebileceğimi biliyordum bana da kötü davranan kimse yoktu hiçbir tavsiye almadan yatağa gitmenin daha iyi olduğuna karar verdim

düzenle bu sabah bana çikolata aldı ve iyi hissetmediğim için üzgün olduğunu söyledi eve giderken durup yemek almamı söyleyen insanlara gelince bugün kesinlikle duracağım çünkü canım mcdonalds çekiyor hehe"
"Last Monday I woke up at 5am for work, the night before my wife had gotten home from work at 10:30 and brought a guy friend of ours home because she was going to drive him to work the next afternoon.

I hungout with them for maybe 30-50 minutes and had a drink and chatted then went to bed since I had to wake up at 5am.
I woke up and, my wife wasn't in bed with me.
As I opened the bedroom door and entered the hallway to use the bathroom,to get ready, at the end of the hall I could see my wife and this guy, cuddled face to face on the couch in my living room holding too close for my comfort.

I rushed into the bathroom to pee, but the whole time was thinking about how I just had to wake her up, they must have been up late drinking and passed out, I need to get her to bed, it must be innocent, they got drunk, it's fine.

I left the bathroom after maybe 2 minutes?
My wife was at the counter picking out music to play on her phone and the dude was at the opposite end of the couch I had just seen them face to face cuddling on.

She was obviously drunk, I told her it was almost 5:30am and to go to bed and she said ""no, we are listening and enjoying music together.""
So I said
""OK, you don't work today, I'll see you tonight.""

I'm a very trusting dude, but the whole situation felt off to me.
All day at work in was hoping I would come home and he would be gone, I sent my wife a text saying how I trusted her, but felt very uncomfortable and never heard back.

When I got home at 5pm she was asleep in bed and he was gone to my relief.
I told her how it made me feel very uncomfortable and she understood and apologized.
All week afterwards I felt like something was off however.

This was last Monday morning.

Tuesday she became a sexual goddess when she honestly hasn't been wanting me more than 2-3 times a month up to this point.
She was texting me all last week horny and when I was home couldn't get enough of me to the point we were doing it 3-6 times a night.

On Friday, i told her it all felt off me to, and that I was still off put by her laying with him on the couch cuddling and asked her if he had kissed her because it had been bothering me all week after seeing them and that I think they kissed.

She said.
""Yes, he kissed me""
I asked after a deep breath,
""So what did you do?""
And
She said,
""I kissed him back.""

My heart broke, I asked a ton of questions, it turns out that was the only night they kissed, but he did sleep in my bed and cuddle her while I was on a business trip the weekend prior.
They kissed multiple times that night while I was asleep in the next room asleep cause i had to go to work the next day and provide for us, they even went to her car to listen to music and kissed there too that night apparently.

I do not know what to do, I'm a very faithful man, I get hit on a lot and enjoy bragging to the ladies in question that I have a beautiful woman at home.
I was raised by my mom and saw her cheated on multiple times and I could never bring myself to do something like what my wife just did or to any woman in general, I'd rather just leave then have knowing I did that on my mental burdens list.

This was last Friday, today is the following Wednesday, I am still at our home, but I am asking for space and hardly talking to her cause I do not know what to say and what she has done has hurt me a lot but I still love her, I just don't know if I'm gonna get over this or be able to kiss her and not picture her kissing him, I have a place I can go for a bit, but can't bring my animals so I'd still have to come here daily until I found a place. 

Woman can't even scoop a litter box or feed my cat.

I do love the woman, I am just very hurt, any questions I'll answer, but I honestly just need advice right now.","geçen pazartesi sabah işe gitmek için uyandım, karım işten eve gelmeden önceki gece ve bir erkek arkadaşımızı eve getirdim çünkü ertesi öğleden sonra onu işe götürecekti

onlarla belki dakikalarca takıldım, bir içki içtim ve sohbet ettim sonra sabah uyanmam gerektiği için yatağa girdim

uyandım ve karım benimle yatakta değildi
yatak odası kapısını açıp banyoyu kullanmak için koridora girdiğimde hazırlanmak için koridorun sonunda karımla bu adamın oturma odamdaki kanepede yüz yüze sarılmış olduklarını görebiliyordum, rahatım için fazla yakın duruyorlardı

işemek için banyoya koştum ama bütün bu zaman boyunca onu uyandırmam gerektiğini düşünüyordum, geç saatlere kadar içki içip bayılmış olmalılar, onu yatağa yatırmam gerek, masum olmalılar, sarhoş oldular, sorun değil

banyodan belki dakikalar sonra çıktım
karım tezgahta telefonunda çalacak müzik seçiyordu ve adam kanepenin diğer ucundaydı, onları yüz yüze sarılmış halde görmüştüm

belli ki sarhoştu ona neredeyse sabah olduğunu ve yatağa gitmesi gerektiğini söyledim ve hayır, birlikte müzik dinliyoruz ve keyfini çıkarıyoruz dedi
bu yüzden dedim ki
tamam bugün çalışmıyorsun, bu gece görüşürüz

ben çok güvenen bir adamım ama tüm durum bana garip geldi
tüm gün işte eve gelip onun gitmiş olmasını umuyordum, karıma ona güvendiğimi ama kendimi çok rahatsız hissettiğimi ve hiçbir zaman geri dönüş almadığımı söyleyen bir mesaj attım

akşam eve geldiğimde yatakta uyuyordu ve o gitmişti, rahatladım
ona bunun beni çok rahatsız ettiğini söyledim ve o da anlayışla karşıladı ve özür diledi
sonraki tüm hafta bir şeylerin ters gittiğini hissettim

bu geçen pazartesi sabahıydı

salı günü dürüst olmak gerekirse bu noktaya kadar ayda bir kereden fazla beni istememesine rağmen cinsel bir tanrıçaya dönüştü
geçen hafta boyunca bana azgın bir şekilde mesaj atıyordu ve ben evdeyken benden o kadar doyamıyordu ki bunu her gece yapıyorduk

cuma günü ona her şeyin bana garip geldiğini ve onunla kanepede sarılıp yatmasından hala rahatsız olduğumu söyledim ve ona onu öptüm çünkü onları gördükten sonra bütün hafta boyunca beni rahatsız etmişti ve sanırım öpüştüler

dedi
evet beni öptü
derin bir nefes aldıktan sonra sordum
peki sen ne yaptın
ve
dedi
ben de onu öptüm

kalbim kırıldı bir sürü soru sordum meğerse öpüştükleri tek gece oymuş ama o benim yatağımda yatmış ve bir hafta önce iş seyahatindeyken ona sarılmış
o gece ben yan odada uyurken birkaç kez öpüştüler çünkü ertesi gün işe gitmem ve bize bakmam gerekiyordu hatta müzik dinlemek için arabasına bile gittiler ve o gece orada da öpüştüler görünüşe göre

ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum çok sadık bir adamım çok fazla flört ediliyorum ve söz konusu hanımlara evde güzel bir kadın olduğunu övünerek anlatmayı seviyorum
annem tarafından büyütüldüm ve onun beni defalarca aldattığını gördüm ve karımın veya genel olarak herhangi bir kadının yaptığı gibi bir şeyi asla yapamam, bunu zihinsel yüklerim listesine eklediğimi bilmektense onu terk etmeyi tercih ederim

bu sonuncusuydu bugün cuma, takip eden çarşamba, hala evimizdeyim ama alan istiyorum ve onunla pek konuşmuyorum çünkü ne diyeceğimi bilmiyorum ve yaptığı şey beni çok üzdü ama onu hala seviyorum sadece bunun üstesinden gelip gelemeyeceğimi veya onu öpüp onu öperken hayal edemeyeceğimi bilmiyorum bir süreliğine gidebileceğim bir yer var ama hayvanlarımı getiremiyorum bu yüzden bir yer bulana kadar her gün buraya gelmek zorundayım

kadın çöp kutusunu bile temizleyemiyor veya kedimi besleyemiyor

olduğum kadını seviyorum sadece çok incindim herhangi bir sorunuz varsa cevaplarım ama dürüst olmak gerekirse şu anda sadece tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var"
"My now Daughter just came out as MtF Trans.
I was very happy and proud of them to come up with the courage to tell me to say the least.

In a sign of love for her  I hung up a trans flag next to my door on a rod.
(I bought the flag from a local flag shop the following day)
I live right next to an LDS church so I kind of suspected it may stir up some issues.

Guess what it did.
2 days later a group of 3 Teenagers came on my porch and  took it down and stole it.
Which did not make me a happy camper.

Didn't call the cops because I knew that I can fix this issue.

I ordered a larger Trans Flag on Amazon and 3 days later I hung that Son Of A B**ch on the side of my home literally facing the LDS church.
(If you went out of the entrance you can see it very blatantly)

1 week goes by and a neighbor knocked on my door and told me that she goes to the church and that many members of that church find the flag """"""""""""""""""""Distracting""""""""""""""""""""

And very politely asked me to take it down.

I told them about the situation about my stolen flag. 
And said she would be willing to pay 3x the original value of the Stolen flag and The one I bought on Amazon, If I just took it down.
I said ""Would it make your life easier if I took it down?""

She said Yes and said I would ask my daughter what she thinks and you'll know if I decide to take it down or not in 2 days.

They wished me a good day and left.

So should I take the flag down? 
Should I leave it up to my Daughter?
Or should I say F em and leave it up....

Edit:
I want to make it clear I hung up the flag in support of my daughter. 
I knew it might stir something and thats completely fine with me.

But then the flag got stolen, so to prevent that from happening again I erected a larger one on the side of my home higher on the second story of it.
To make sure it didn't get stolen again.
And that's literally it.
The fact that it's pointing towards the church now I could just claim was unintentional. But for me it's just an added bonus.
Call me a Drama queen and a Pot Stirrer I'll be the bad guy here IDGAF.

UPDATE: 

Talking to my friends and family and seeing this thread has led to the decision of keeping it up.

I had a conversation with my daughter and we both agreed we both wanted the flag to stay up regardless of any potential consequences that may come with it.
Not going to make a huge scene out of it.

I usually keep my gate open because I don't think there would be any issues. But now that some issues have arised I will be keeping it locked for the time being. 
So that Church lady would have to physically jump over the fence to talk to me again.
Which me or my daughter don't want to.

People have suggested taking the money and leaving it up but I want as least amount of issues as possible with these people.
Thank you all for the input!","şimdiki kızım mtf trans olarak dünyaya geldi
onların bana en azından cesaretle söylemelerini sağladığı için çok mutlu ve gururluydum

ona olan sevgimin bir göstergesi olarak kapımın yanına bir çubuğa bir trans bayrağı astım
bayrağı ertesi gün yerel bir bayrak dükkanından aldım
bir lds kilisesinin hemen yanında oturuyorum bu yüzden bazı sorunları tetikleyebileceğinden şüphelendim

tahmin edin ne oldu
günler sonra bir grup genç verandama geldi ve bayrağı indirip çaldı
bu beni mutlu etmedi

polisi aramadım çünkü bu sorunu çözebileceğimi biliyordum

amazon'dan daha büyük bir trans bayrağı sipariş ettim ve günler sonra o bch'nin oğlunu evimin tam olarak lds kilisesine bakan tarafına astım
girişten dışarı çıktığınızda bunu çok açık bir şekilde görebilirsiniz

hafta geçti ve bir komşum kapımı çaldı ve bana kiliseye gittiğini ve o kilisenin birçok üyesinin bayrağı dikkat dağıtıcı bulduğunu söyledi

ve çok nazik bir şekilde sordu ben onu indirmeliyim

onlara çalınan bayrağımla ilgili durumu anlattım
ve eğer onu indirirsem çalınan bayrağın ve amazon'dan satın aldığım bayrağın orijinal değerinin x kadarını ödemeye razı olacağını söyledim
indirirsem hayatını kolaylaştırır mı dedim

evet dedi ve kızımın ne düşündüğünü soracağımı ve indirmeye karar verip vermediğimi birkaç gün içinde öğreneceğini söyledi

bana iyi günler dilediler ve gittiler

yani bayrağı indirmeli miyim
bunu kızıma mı bırakmalıyım
yoksa f em deyip asmalı mıyım

düzenle
bayrağı kızımın desteği için astığımı açıkça belirtmek istiyorum
bir şeyleri harekete geçirebileceğini biliyordum ve bu benim için tamamen sorun değil

ama sonra bayrak çalındı ​​bu yüzden bunun tekrar olmasını önlemek için evimin yan tarafına ikinci katına daha büyük bir tane diktim
tekrar çalınmamasını sağlamak için
ve tam olarak bu
şimdi kiliseye doğru işaret ediyor olması sadece kasıtsız olduğunu iddia edebilirdim ama benim için sadece ek bir bonus
bana drama kraliçesi ve tencere karıştırıcısı deyin, burada kötü adam ben olurum umrumda değil

güncelleme

arkadaşlarımla ve ailemle konuşmak ve bu başlığı görmek, onu devam ettirme kararına yol açtı

kızımla bir konuşma yaptım ve ikimiz de bayrağın olası sonuçlardan bağımsız olarak yukarıda kalmasını istediğimiz konusunda anlaştık
bundan büyük bir olay çıkarmayacağım

genellikle kapımı açık tutarım çünkü herhangi bir sorun çıkacağını düşünmüyorum ama şimdi bazı sorunlar ortaya çıktığına göre şimdilik kilitli tutacağım
böylece kilise hanımı benimle tekrar konuşmak için fiziksel olarak çitin üzerinden atlamak zorunda kalacak
ki ben veya kızım bunu istemiyor

insanlar parayı alıp açık bırakmayı önerdiler ama bu insanlarla mümkün olduğunca az sorun yaşamak istiyorum

"I (20 M) currently live in a dormitory and my roommate (around 22 M) is having sex with a girl multiple times a day while I'm there.

It started a few days ago and this happens either early in the morning (and I sometimes get woken up by the noise), either very late at night, so I can't for example go somewhere else for a bit to leave the room alone for him; I already made it clear to him that if he needs the room alone he can talk to me and we can work something out. He thanked me but never asked me this.

The furniture in the room is placed in such a way as to not have direct sight to each other's bed without going a bit in the other's half of the room, but every sound can be heard clearly, to the point where it gets frustrating and concentration is impossible. They try to muffle the sound by playing music (goddamn club music) but the thrusting and panting can still be heard flagrantly clear.

Should I ignore it (I will move out of the dorm in 1 month)? Should I talk to him and ask him to stop doing it while I am in the room? Or maybe I could start doing silly things while they do the deed to have a laugh for the small time until my leave; my girlfriend is also in the dorm and she is also willing to have some fun on this matter.

Edit: I did not expect getting so much attention. Thank you!

At first I thought that having fun about it would be immature. I still think that, but now that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

I'll start making a list with the suggestions, ordering them from mild to extreme, and start applying them.

I'll try to come back with updates.

  
Edit: Sorry for late update. Cbat fucking worked I can't believe it. They took a few days of pause, but once they started doing it again I played Cbat on my laptop's speakers. They continued doing it for a few seconds, but then I heard some frustrated breaths and they stopped.

  
The next time however I got really mad. They did it again a few days later in the morning, waking me up, and, because I had an exam that day that was stressing me, I bursted out telling him how annoying it is to hear their agonizing sounds. I told him I am not ok with this and that I have him the option to ask for some alone time for a reason.

The following day he apologized saying that I was right, but asked of me that next time I tell him my problems in private as it caused him some problems with the girl (for real).

I never heard them explicitly having sex after that, but I suspect that at certain times they were engaging in lighter stuff.

He also started being saltier and generally less nice. He started demanding a lot of stuff, and in certain cases accused me doing stuff like using his deodorant (because he found one hair on it.)

Also, his girlfriend started coming in the room when he was not there, sometimes even unlocking the door, to cook for him and to clean his stuff.

Thankfully the time of my leaving was approaching, and now I don't have to deal with that.","şu anda bir yurtta yaşıyorum ve oda arkadaşım oradayken günde birkaç kez bir kızla seks yapıyor

birkaç gün önce başladı ve bu ya sabahın erken saatlerinde oluyor ve bazen gürültüden uyanıyorum ya da gecenin çok geç saatlerinde oluyor bu yüzden örneğin odayı onun için yalnız bırakmak için başka bir yere gidemiyorum ona odada yalnız kalması gerekirse benimle konuşabileceğini ve bir şeyler ayarlayabileceğimizi zaten açıkça belirttim bana teşekkür etti ama bunu bana hiç sormadı

odadaki mobilyalar odanın diğer yarısına biraz girmeden birbirimizin yatağına doğrudan görüş olmayacak şekilde yerleştirilmiş ama her ses açıkça duyulabiliyor sinir bozucu hale geliyor ve konsantrasyon imkansız hale geliyor müzik çalarak sesi bastırmaya çalışıyorlar lanet olası kulüp müziği ama itme ve soluma sesleri hala açıkça duyulabiliyor

bunu görmezden mi gelmeliyim bir ay içinde yurttan taşınacağım onunla konuşup odadayken bunu yapmayı bırakmasını mı söylemeliyim yoksa belki de odadayken aptalca şeyler yapmaya başlayabilirim küçük bir zaman diliminde eğlenmek için yapıyorlar, ben ayrılana kadar kız arkadaşım da yurtta ve o da bu konuda biraz eğlenmeye istekli

düzenle bu kadar ilgi görmeyi beklemiyordum teşekkür ederim

ilk başta bununla eğlenmenin çocukça olacağını düşündüm hala öyle düşünüyorum ama şimdi tam olarak yapacağım şey bu

önerileri hafiften aşırıya doğru sıralayarak bir liste yapmaya başlayacağım ve uygulamaya başlayacağım

güncellemelerle geri dönmeye çalışacağım

düzenle geç güncelleme için özür dilerim cbat çok işe yaradı inanamıyorum birkaç gün ara verdiler ama tekrar yapmaya başladıklarında dizüstü bilgisayarımın hoparlörlerinden cbat'i açtım birkaç saniye daha yapmaya devam ettiler ama sonra sinirli nefes sesleri duydum ve bıraktılar

ancak bir sonraki sefer çok sinirlendim birkaç gün sonra sabah beni uyandırarak tekrar yaptılar ve o gün beni strese sokan bir sınavım olduğu için ona acı dolu seslerini duymanın ne kadar sinir bozucu olduğunu söyleyerek patladım ona bunun benim için sorun olmadığını ve biraz yalnız kalma talebinde bulunma seçeneğinin olduğunu söyledim sebep

ertesi gün özür diledi ve haklı olduğumu söyledi ama benden bir dahaki sefere ona sorunlarımı özel olarak anlatmamı istedi çünkü bu kızla gerçekten bazı sorunlar yaşamasına neden oldu

ondan sonra açıkça seks yaptıklarını hiç duymadım ama belli zamanlarda daha hafif şeyler yaptıklarından şüpheleniyorum

ayrıca daha tuzlu ve genel olarak daha az nazik olmaya başladı, bir sürü şey talep etmeye başladı ve belli durumlarda deodorantını kullandığım gibi şeyler yaptığımı iddia etti çünkü üzerinde bir saç teli buldu

ayrıca kız arkadaşı o yokken odaya girmeye başladı hatta bazen ona yemek pişirmek ve eşyalarını temizlemek için kapıyı bile açtı

çok şükür ki ayrılma zamanım yaklaşıyordu ve artık bununla uğraşmak zorunda değilim"
"Oh, so I have a daughter named Daisy, she is 16. I made another post about her. She has became a hermit. 1 day she starts yelling ""My face isn't my face"". I look at her and I ask Her what she means by that. She says ""they took out my face and replaced my face"". She screaming and crying that her face isn't her face. I don't know what to do. 

Guys, I did take her to the hospital. This happened this morning. ","ah, papatya adında bir kızım var, onun hakkında bir yazı daha yazdım, bir münzevi oldu, bir gün bağırmaya başladı, yüzüm benim yüzüm değil, ona baktım ve ne demek istediğini sordum, yüzümü çıkarıp yerine yüzümü koyduklarını söyledi, yüzünün onun yüzü olmadığını söyleyerek çığlık atıyor ve ağlıyor, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum

arkadaşlar, onu hastaneye götürdüm, bu sabah oldu"
"(throw away because i am afraid of family finding this.)

so... for some background knowledge, i graduated highschool last year (class of '23) and my fiancé (who we'll call daniel) is a highschool dropout. while he has some sort of an income, i am usually the one who brings in the money. however, i am now 37 weeks pregnant and about to pop. naturally, i went on maternity leave about a month ago. i work as a waitress at a local diner. i moved in with daniel about 3 months after i graduated, a little after i found out i was pregnant with his kid.

about a week ago, i walked in on him masturbating over an open tampon. keep in mind, i am pregnant and have not had my period for quite some time now. i was shocked to say the least, but the whole situation admittedly is funny as hell. i let out a laugh while standing in the doorway of our bedroom, and he turned to me with the most embarrassed expression i'd ever seen on him. 

i held back another laugh and asked what on earth was he doing???? to which he replied, ""i want to get baby number 2 cooking and figured if i did this in secret, next time you have shark week you'd use one and get pregnant again."" and i was SHOCKED. i didn't know men were this stupid when it came to how menstrual cycles worked. i honestly doubted if i wanted this man to be the father of my kid. 

i stood there in awe and genuinely went silent for about 5 minutes. i then explained to him that's not how it worked and it only made him more embarrassed. 

we haven't talked about it brought it up since.

looking back at it now, it's still pretty funny to me in an uncomfortable way, but i genuinely don't know if this is something i can forget about and move past. 

is this something worth breaking up over???? 

UPDATE: i have decided to break things off with him as soon as possible. thank you for everyone congratulating me on the pregnancy and for everyone giving me genuine advice, i am truly grateful for it 🫶🏻

without going into too much detail, baby number one was completely unplanned. i knew i was too young to have a kid, but i went through with it anyways because the thought of being a mother excited me. i am going to look into adoption and possibly staying with my sister for a little while just so i can get back on my feet.

if this happened to be my fiancé making up an excuse on the spot - i still do not want him to raise my child if i do keep it, nor do i want him to be in my life any longer because he doesn't have himself together. 

thank you again everyone


UPDATE 2: so, some extra information since people seem to be confused. i understand that he's not going to just disappear from my life, but if this does get taken to court i have a much higher chance at winning custody than he does. i was the one who paid most of the bills in our shared apartment and he only helped out by buying groceries occasionally. 


besides this issue, daniel was just overall very lazy. i'd constantly clean up after him, cook for him, remind him to shower etc. and after some hard thinking i do not want to deal with that on top of being a new mother. 

the ""maternity leave"" i previously mentioned was issued by a doctor because my feet were so swollen and so sore that i could no longer work long hours and be on my feet. i have known the owners of the diner since i was a young girl, and they're very understanding for the most part. 

as of right now, i have talked to my sister about the situation and she offered for me to stay with her temporarily. i am still heavily leaning toward keeping the baby, and while this may seem dumb, i just don't think i have it in me to get rid of it. 

i have not talked to daniel about any of this yet because i am honestly a little scared to, he has a tendency to get angry easily and i can't imagine him taking this news well. i will probably talk to him about it at lunch today.

again, thank you everyone for the support 🫶🏻
","ailemin bunu bulmasından korktuğum için atıyorum

biraz arka plan bilgisi için geçen yıl liseden mezun oldum ve nişanlım, daniel diyelim, lise terk, bir çeşit geliri var, genellikle parayı getiren benim, ancak şu anda haftalık hamileyim ve doğal olarak doğum yapacağım, yaklaşık bir ay önce doğum iznine ayrıldım, yerel bir lokantada garson olarak çalışıyorum, mezun olduktan yaklaşık aylar sonra, çocuğuna hamile olduğumu öğrendikten biraz sonra, daniel ile yaşamaya başladım

yaklaşık bir hafta önce, açık bir tamponun üstünde mastürbasyon yaparken yakaladım, hamile olduğumu ve bir süredir adet görmediğimi unutmayın, en hafif tabirle şok oldum ama tüm durum gerçekten çok komik, yatak odamızın kapısında dururken bir kahkaha attım ve bana şimdiye kadar gördüğüm en mahcup ifadeyle döndü

bir kahkahamı daha bastırdım ve ne yaptığını sordum, bebek numarası yemek pişirmek istiyorum dedi ve bir dahaki sefere köpekbalığı haftasında bunu gizlice yaparsam diye düşündüm birini kullanıp tekrar hamile kalırdın ve şok oldum, adet döngülerinin nasıl çalıştığı konusunda erkeklerin bu kadar aptal olduğunu bilmiyordum, dürüst olmak gerekirse bu adamın çocuğumun babası olmasını isteyip istemediğimden şüphe ediyordum

orada hayranlıkla durdum ve gerçekten birkaç dakika sessiz kaldım, sonra ona bunun böyle çalışmadığını açıkladım ve bu onu daha da utandırdı

o zamandan beri bunun hakkında konuşmadık, bu konuyu açtı

şimdi geriye dönüp baktığımda hala rahatsız edici bir şekilde komik geliyor ama bunun unutabileceğim ve atlatabileceğim bir şey olup olmadığını gerçekten bilmiyorum

bu ayrılmaya değer bir şey mi

güncelleme, onunla en kısa sürede ilişkimi bitirmeye karar verdim, hamileliğim için beni tebrik eden ve bana gerçek tavsiyelerde bulunan herkese teşekkür ederim, bunun için gerçekten minnettarım

çok fazla ayrıntıya girmeden, bir numaralı bebeğim tamamen plansızdı, çocuk sahibi olmak için çok küçük olduğumu biliyordum ama yine de yaptım çünkü anne olma düşüncesi beni heyecanlandırdı, evlat edinmeyi ve muhtemelen bir süre kız kardeşimle kalmayı araştıracağım sadece ayağa kalkabilmem için

eğer bu nişanlımın anında bir bahane uydurmasıysa, çocuğumu büyütmesini istemiyorum, eğer tutarsam da artık hayatımda olmasını istemiyorum çünkü kendini toparlayamıyor

herkese tekrar teşekkür ederim

güncelleme, bu yüzden bazı ek bilgiler, çünkü insanlar kafası karışık gibi görünüyor, onun hayatımdan öylece kaybolmayacağını anlıyorum ama eğer bu mahkemeye taşınırsa velayeti kazanma şansım ondan çok daha yüksek, ortak dairemizdeki faturaların çoğunu ben ödüyordum ve o sadece ara sıra market alışverişi yaparak yardım ediyordu

bu sorunun yanı sıra daniel genel olarak çok tembeldi, sürekli onun arkasını temizlerdim, ona yemek pişirirdim, duş almasını vb. hatırlatırdım ve biraz düşündükten sonra yeni bir anne olmanın üstüne bunlarla uğraşmak istemiyorum

daha önce bahsettiğim doğum izni, ayaklarım çok şiş ve çok ağrıdığı için bir doktor tarafından verildi, artık uzun saatler çalışamıyor ve ayakta duramıyordum, lokantanın sahiplerini küçüklüğümden beri tanıyorum genç bir kız ve çoğunlukla çok anlayışlılar

şu an itibariyle durum hakkında kız kardeşimle konuştum ve bana geçici olarak onunla kalmamı teklif etti, hala bebeği tutmaya meyilliyim ve bu aptalca görünebilir ama ondan kurtulmak için içimden bir şey gelmediğini düşünüyorum

henüz bunların hiçbiri hakkında daniel ile konuşmadım çünkü dürüst olmak gerekirse biraz korkuyorum, kolay sinirlenme eğilimi var ve bu haberi nasıl karşılayacağını hayal edemiyorum, muhtemelen bugün öğle yemeğinde onunla bu konuda konuşacağım

tekrar herkese destekleri için teşekkür ederim"
"My boyfriend and I have been dating 1 year nearly, both very inexperienced (I am a total virgin and he’s only had sex once with a friend where they only had penetrative sex and used toys on her), have had some sexual issues. In the beginning of our relationship, I often gave him blowjobs/handjobs without reciprocation. After addressing it, he began to pleasure me but occasionally would still neglect to return the favor after I pleasured him. It also particularly upset me because it only takes 5 minutes to make me cum, and the fact that he didn’t want to put in effort for just that. Recently, we've improved communication, and he now pleasures me consistently with how much I pleasure him. 


However, I'm slightly frustrated by the lack of variety in his sexual favors. While I've done more invasive things for him (handjobs, blowjobs and trying to deepthroat, bondage while doing blowjobs, etc). Meanwhile the most he’s done with me - ever - is dry humping me with both our underwear on, using his fingers to rub my clit outside of my underwear, use the vibrator on me and now he’s slowly working up to touching me without underwear.


Tonight, after briefly touching me without underwear - we’re talking rubbing me very lightly 4 times - he stopped, saying he lost momentum and didn’t feel 100% focused and energized which he says he needs when he wants to push his boundaries because he doesn’t want to disappoint me. He often uses this reason to halt further activity. It somehow bothers me though. I get in very vulnerable positions and do pretty invasive stuff for him. We toy around with bondage and I regularly get strapped down to perform oral on him - which I enjoy - but it does bother me that I’ve done all that yet he hasn’t even touched me down there fully yet, let alone even think about oral. He’s reassured me it’s not my body, smell, etc, anything, which I’ve specifically asked about and said I wouldn’t be offended. 


I tell him we can take things at his pace and I don’t express any of this frustration to him, only support, but I worry he’s using discomfort as an excuse to avoid effort, knowing he doesnt have to touch me down there and can just resort back to using the vibrator for 3 minutes to make me cum so he can then recieve a 20-minute bondage blowjob instead. I don’t want to push him, but the slow progress frustrates me. Advice appreciated.","erkek arkadaşım ve ben neredeyse bir yıldır çıkıyoruz, ikimiz de çok deneyimsiziz, ben tamamen bakireyim ve o sadece bir arkadaşıyla sadece bir kez seks yaptı, sadece penetrasyonlu seks yaptılar ve ona oyuncaklar kullandılar, ilişkimizin başında bazı cinsel sorunlar yaşadık, ona sık sık oral seks yaptım, elle mastürbasyon yaptım, karşılıksız olarak, bunu ele aldıktan sonra bana zevk vermeye başladı ama bazen ona zevk verdikten sonra iyiliği karşılıksız bırakmayı ihmal etti, bu beni özellikle üzdü çünkü boşalmam sadece birkaç dakika sürüyor ve bunun için çaba sarf etmek istemiyordu, son zamanlarda iletişimimizi geliştirdik ve şimdi beni ne kadar zevk verdiğimle tutarlı bir şekilde zevklendiriyor

ancak onun cinsel iyiliklerinde çeşitlilik olmamasından biraz hayal kırıklığına uğradım, ben onun için daha invaziv şeyler yaptım, elle mastürbasyon, oral seks ve oral seks yaparken derin boğaz esaret denemeleri vb. bu arada benimle yaptığı en fazla şey, ikimizin de iç çamaşırıyla bana kuru bir şekilde dokunmak, iç çamaşırımın dışında klitorisimi parmaklarıyla ovmak, üzerimde vibratör kullanmak ve şimdi yavaş yavaş iç çamaşırı olmadan bana dokunmaya hazırlanıyor

bu gece Kısa bir süre iç çamaşırı olmadan bana dokunduktan sonra beni çok hafifçe ovuşturduk, bazen momentumunu kaybettiğini ve odaklanmış ve enerjik hissetmediğini söyleyerek durdu, sınırlarını zorlamak istediğinde buna ihtiyacı olduğunu söylüyor çünkü beni hayal kırıklığına uğratmak istemiyor, genellikle daha fazla aktiviteyi durdurmak için bu nedeni kullanıyor, yine de beni rahatsız ediyor, çok savunmasız pozisyonlara giriyorum ve onun için oldukça istilacı şeyler yapıyorum, esaretle oynuyoruz ve ona oral yapmak için düzenli olarak bağlanıyorum, bundan hoşlanıyorum ama tüm bunları yapmış olmam beni rahatsız ediyor, henüz tam olarak oraya dokunmadı, oral yapmayı bırakın, beni rahatlattı, bunun benim vücudumun kokusu olmadığını vb. özellikle sorduğum hiçbir şey için ve kırılmayacağımı söyledim

ona işleri kendi hızında yapabileceğimizi söylüyorum ve bu hayal kırıklığını ona sadece destek olarak ifade etmiyorum ama çabadan kaçınmak için rahatsızlığı bir bahane olarak kullandığından endişeleniyorum, bana oraya dokunmak zorunda olmadığını ve beni boşaltmak için dakikalarca vibratör kullanmaya geri dönebileceğini ve bunun yerine bir dakikalık esaret oral seks alabileceğini biliyor, onu zorlamak istemiyorum ama yavaş ilerleme beni hayal kırıklığına uğratıyor tavsiyeniz takdir edilir"

"I just want to say firstly, I would never judge his body or make him do something he doesn’t want to do but I believe my reason for wanting him to shave is pretty valid. 

This is going to be very explicit so read and your own discretion 🤣

When we have sex, his pubes are so thick and long it’s genuinely feels like carpet burn on my pussy. It hurts. And his pubes will end up INSIDE OF ME. I have to go to the toilet and pull these THICK ass pubes out of my pussy and get this… my butt hole too. Last night I pulled three of his pubes from my butt hole. Dont ask me how because we don’t even do anal, it just happened with all the friction. And they really hurt, they feel sharp. One time a really thick sharp hair of his got stuck in the hood of my clit and left it hurting for 2 days. Imagine the pain when I pulled that fucker out, I wanted to cry. 

Its not even that he doesn’t want to shave, he just says he hasn’t had the time which I don’t think is true because I haven’t seen him all week till yesterday and he just goes home and plays games after work. 

It’s getting to the point where I’m going to give him an ultimatum, and say I refuse to have sex till he shaves. It’s not even a preference, it’s just genuinely getting in the way of me being able to enjoy sex now because of this. 

Does anyone have any advice? I’m not being out of order here am I? ","sadece ilk olarak şunu söylemek istiyorum ki asla vücudunu yargılamam veya yapmak istemediği bir şeyi yapmasını sağlamam ama tıraş olmasını istememin sebebinin oldukça geçerli olduğuna inanıyorum

bu çok açık olacak bu yüzden okuyun ve kendi takdirinize bağlı

seks yaptığımızda kasık kılları çok kalın ve uzun, gerçekten de vajinamda halı yanığı gibi hissettiriyor, acıyor ve kasık kılları içimde bitiyor tuvalete gidip bu kalın kıç kıllarını vajinamdan çekip çıkarmak zorundayım ve bunu da göt deliğime alıyorum dün gece göt deliğimden üç kasık kılını çıkardım bana nasıl olduğunu sormayın çünkü anal seks bile yapmıyoruz sadece tüm sürtünmeden dolayı oldu ve gerçekten çok acıtıyorlar, bir keresinde çok kalın ve keskin bir kılı klitorisimin başlığına takıldı ve günlerce acıttı o orospuyu çıkardığımda ne kadar acıdığını hayal edin ağlamak istedim

aslında tıraş olmak istemiyor, sadece vakti olmadığını söylüyor ki bunun doğru olduğunu düşünmüyorum çünkü dün geceye kadar onu bütün hafta görmedim ve eve gitti ve işten sonra oyun oynuyor

iş, ona bir ültimatom verip tıraş olana kadar seks yapmayı reddettiğimi söyleyeceğim noktaya geliyor, bu bir tercih bile değil, sadece bu yüzden artık seksten zevk almamın önünde engel teşkil ediyor

herkesin bir tavsiyesi var mı, burada sıra dışı davranmıyorum, ben"
"I am a fairly normal guy, married and with a baby. I say fairly normal because for a while I’ve wondered what it was like to wear feminine clothing like dresses, skirts, bras, etc. I am not trans or anything. I simply like the feeling of it. The only person who knew my secret was my wife, until today. She was a little confused by it but was supportive, saying that people can wear whatever they want especially if it makes them feel safe. 

A little bit of background. My wife and her family are extremely liberal. My wife has a trans sibling. My family is extremely conservative. They think that trans people have a mental illness. I sit somewhere in the middle of those two. My wife has always had a rocky relationship with my family, not really liking them but trying to be part of the family for me. 

As I said above, I told my wife about wanting to try wearing a skirt or dress or bra, and she was supportive. And tbh I liked it. Everything was soft, the bra felt like a constant hug. I would casually wear it around the house when me and the wife and baby were having a casual day. I’d sometimes wear leggings and a bra to bed because like I said, it felt like a constant hug. 

We wake up early because the baby likes to be up between 6 and 7am every morning. My wife grabbed the baby this morning and let me sleep in until a little after 7, as the baby was up at 2am crying and not feeling well at all. I woke up, played with the baby for a few minutes, and went to my office to play some of my video games for a bit before starting my day. 

My wife brought the baby into the room and sat her down next to me, and gave her one of her baby toy controllers. She took a picture, as it was incredibly cute. She sent the picture to my mom, as she wanted to show my mom how cute the baby was. In the picture, I was wearing what I fell asleep in; a bra and some sweat pants. I also did not know that the picture was sent, as I was busy playing my game and playing with the baby at the same time. 

My mom started blowing up my phone, asking me why the fuck I was wearing that, and why I would do that to my child. She also implied that I was being a pedophile and that I was harming my child. I begged her to forget about it, pretend like it never happened, because it meant nothing. She said my dad saw and asked why I would do that to him. I told them both that it meant nothing and if they were going to imply that I was hurting my child, we did not need to be in contact anymore. I also said that I was wearing that because it calms the baby down and reminds her of being with her mom, like those videos you see online of dads putting on bras and wearing the moms perfume so the baby will be calm for them. I haven’t heard anything from either of them since a few hours ago. 

I know my wife meant well. She did not maliciously do this, and she has not stopped crying and apologizing. I am not mad at her, I am mad at the situation and the fact that she couldn’t stop and double check the photo to make sure that the top half of me couldn’t be seen. 

I need advice, I don’t know how to move forward. I’ve already been so incredibly depressed since April. I got let go from my job of 3 years and I have been desperately looking for work, but have been unable to find anything. I don’t know what to do. I have no job, we are living off of one income and I cannot provide for my wife and child. My awesome relationship with my family is now ruined, and they think I’m a pedo. I really don’t know what to do now.","Ben evli ve bir bebekli oldukça normal bir adamım Oldukça normal diyorum çünkü bir süredir elbise etek sütyen gibi kadınsı kıyafetler giymenin nasıl bir şey olduğunu merak ediyordum Trans değilim veya başka bir şey değilim sadece bunun hissini seviyorum Sırrımı bilen tek kişi bugün karımdı, biraz kafası karışmıştı ama destekleyiciydi, insanların istediklerini giyebileceklerini, özellikle de kendilerini güvende hissettiriyorsa

Biraz geçmiş bilgisi karım ve ailesi aşırı liberal karımın trans bir kardeşi var ailem aşırı muhafazakar, trans insanların akıl hastalığı olduğunu düşünüyorlar ben bu ikisinin ortasında bir yerde oturuyorum karımın ailemle her zaman inişli çıkışlı bir ilişkisi oldu onları pek sevmedim ama benim için ailenin bir parçası olmaya çalıştım

Yukarıda söylediğim gibi karıma etek, elbise veya sütyen giymeyi denemek istediğimi söyledim ve destekleyiciydi ve açıkçası beğendim her şey yumuşaktı sütyen sürekli bir kucaklama gibiydi evde karım ve bebeğimle rahat bir gün geçirirken rahatça giyerdim bazen yatakta tayt ve sütyen giyerdim çünkü dediğim gibi sürekli bir kucaklama gibiydi

Bebek her sabah uyandığında ve arasında olmayı sevdiği için erken uyanıyoruz. Eşim bu sabah bebeği aldı ve bebek sabah ağlayarak ve hiç iyi hissetmediği için biraz uyumama izin verdi. Uyandım, bebekle birkaç dakika oynadım ve günüme başlamadan önce biraz video oyunları oynamak için ofisime gittim.

Eşim bebeği odaya getirdi ve yanıma oturttu ve ona bebek oyuncak kumandalarından birini verdi. İnanılmaz derecede sevimli olduğu için bir fotoğraf çekti. Fotoğrafı anneme gönderdi çünkü anneme fotoğraftaki bebeğin ne kadar sevimli olduğunu göstermek istiyordu. Üzerimde sütyen ve eşofmanla uyuyakaldım. Ayrıca fotoğrafın gönderildiğini bilmiyordum çünkü oyunumu oynarken ve aynı zamanda bebekle oynarken meşguldüm.

Annem telefonumu patlatmaya başladı ve bana neden bunu giydiğimi ve çocuğuma neden bunu yaptığımı sordu. Ayrıca pedofil olduğumu ve çocuğuma zarar verdiğimi ima etti. Onu unutması için yalvardım. hiç olmamış gibi davrandı çünkü hiçbir anlamı yoktu dedi babam gördü ve neden ona bunu yaptığımı sordu ikisine de bunun hiçbir anlamı olmadığını ve eğer çocuğuma zarar verdiğimi ima edeceklerse bir daha görüşmemize gerek olmadığını söyledim ayrıca bunu giydiğimi çünkü bebeği sakinleştirdiğini ve internette gördüğünüz babaların sütyen takıp annelerinin parfümünü sürdüğü videolar gibi annesiyle birlikte olduğunu hatırlattığını söyledim böylece bebek onlar için sakinleşecekti birkaç saat önce ikisinden de haber alamadım

karımın iyi niyetli olduğunu biliyorum bunu kötü niyetle yapmadı ve ağlamayı ve özür dilemeyi bırakmadı ona kızgın değilim duruma ve durup fotoğrafı iki kez kontrol edip üst yarımın görünmediğinden emin olamamasına kızgınım

tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var nasıl ilerleyeceğimi bilmiyorum nisan ayından beri inanılmaz derecede depresifim yıllardır yaptığım işten çıkarıldım ve umutsuzca iş arıyorum ama hiçbir şey bulamadım ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum işim yok yaşıyoruz tek bir gelirle geçiniyorum ve karıma ve çocuğuma bakamıyorum ailemle olan harika ilişkim artık mahvoldu ve beni sapık sanıyorlar şimdi ne yapacağımı gerçekten bilmiyorum"

birkaç gün sonra özür diledi ama hala ne dediğini unutamıyorum, bu yüzden yaşadığım ülkenin bir alt kesiminde bunun suç olup olmadığını sordum, ırkçı davranış ve bir daha yaparsa onu şikayet edebilir miyim? Yorumlar aldım, hepsi ırkçıydı, yasaklanana kadar gönderilerimi oylamadılar, ırkçı olmanın yasa dışı olmadığını söylediler, böyle şeyler için insanları hapse atmıyoruz, esmer ülkenize geri dönün, çok fazla iğrenç yorum aldım, kurban rolü yapmak için burada değilim, sadece kendi karına karşı ırkçı olmanın suç olmamasına şaşırdım

"So I (16m) have a semi large friendgroup of around 10 other guys. There are these 2 guys which I will call J (16m) and L (16m). Around 2 months ago, J and L went with some 4 other guys and 2 girls to the L's place, since he lives alone. While they were there 1 of the girls, let's call her A (16f), got extremely drunk and ended up in a hospital. When we asked J and L what happened, they told us that the girl hasn't eaten anything for 2 days and that is why she got extremely drunk so fast and ended up in a hospital. They also said that A was throwing herself at J and tried kissing him. J refused since he is getting really serious with some other girl. 

Now 2 days ago, me and my friend got a call saying that J got beat up by A's boyfriend and that he threw him in the trash. We were sceptical since J is in hospital right now because of something really small, so our first thought was that he lied about his reasons being at the hospital. Later that night we met with A and her boyfriend accidentally and asked them for the story. A's boyfriend explained that J admitted to putting a pill into her drink. A's boyfriend also said that he did just slap him a few times which left bruises, but nothing serious. He said that the reason A tested negative on the drug test is because they used some other pill, which she had to get a special drug test for and it came back positive

Now J is denying everything and he wants to meet up next weekend. So should I ignore it and continue hanging out with J and L or not?","yani diğer adamlardan oluşan yarı büyük bir arkadaş grubum var, j m ve l m diyeceğim adamlar var, aylar önce j ve l, oradayken yalnız yaşadığı için başka birkaç adam ve kızla ls'nin evine gittik, kızlardan biri ona f diyelim, aşırı sarhoş oldu ve hastanede kaldı, j ve l'ye ne olduğunu sorduğumuzda bize kızın günlerdir hiçbir şey yemediğini ve bu yüzden çok hızlı bir şekilde aşırı sarhoş olup hastanede kaldığını söylediler, ayrıca a'nın j'ye kendini attığını ve onu öpmeye çalıştığını söylediler, j, başka bir kızla gerçekten ciddileştiği için reddetti

birkaç gün önce ben ve arkadaşım, j'nin erkek arkadaşı tarafından dövüldüğünü ve onu çöpe attığını söyleyen bir telefon aldık, j şu anda hastanede olduğu için çok küçük bir şey yüzünden şüphelendik, bu yüzden ilk düşüncemiz, o gece hastanede olmasının nedenleri hakkında yalan söylediğiydi, a ve erkek arkadaşıyla yanlışlıkla buluştuk ve onlara hikayeyi sorduk, erkek arkadaş j'nin içeceğine hap koyduğunu itiraf ettiğini ve ayrıca ona birkaç kez tokat attığını söyledi morluklar bıraktı ama ciddi bir şey yoktu, uyuşturucu testinde negatif çıkmasının sebebinin, özel bir uyuşturucu testi yaptırması gereken başka bir hap kullanmaları olduğunu ve pozitif çıktığını söyledi

şimdi j her şeyi inkar ediyor ve önümüzdeki hafta sonu buluşmak istiyor, bu yüzden bunu görmezden gelip j ve l ile takılmaya devam etmeli miyim yoksa etmemeli miyim"
"i am 15 nearly 16 i will be in a month and my mom
makes me sleep in the same bed with the same duvet. 

I have my own room money isnt an issue the only issue is her attachment. Anytime i say im sleeping in my own room she throws a fit she will say “why what do you have to hide?” Or “What so your just leaving me?” i tell her that i want to be a teenager and go to bed later than her iykwim she goes to sleep at like 11pm and takes my phone so i font go on it and waken her. I say to her if u dont want me to waken you let me sleep by myself but she just throws another fit on how i dont love her and how im a horrible child.

When my two older siblings moved out ( 28 and 26) my mum also threw a fit and refused to talk to them for a month and wrecked their things all because they “left her” when my sister is literally in the town beside us and my brother is 10 minutes down the road. I often have sleepovers with one of them to try and catch a break. I also think she thinks i enjoy sleeping with her because ive never really said anything as ive been too scared to say or do anything to her based on her reactions to my siblings leaving.

She also makes comments about what university i will go to but it “has to he close so you can come home to my bed every night” when first the closest one is 1 hr 30m away and second i told her i want to go overseas and live in a dorm etc and she said oh ill have to come too then..

I need advice what is happening!?

(edit) i thought i might also add that she like idk how to describe it in the bed she like tries to spoon me ig idk 😭

"I spoke to my mum on the phone and told her i want her to give me custody of the kids since she is refusing to come back or say when she will be back and i’m done with her bullshit. We argued for like an hour but in the end she said she would do it after i told her I was going to call the police on her 

Before speaking to her i spoke to a lawyer and i should be able to get legal guardianship through a parenting order which will go through court. My 22 year old brother said he will move home and help me under the condition that my mum doesnt move back as he refuses to be around her. His income and input will help a lot and he seems serious about wanting to be involved with parenting and taking care of the kids especially our little brother as he needs a male role model badly

If we cant get custody then my nan should be able to. Either way my mum is very unlikely to keep custody unless she suddenly decides she gives a shit (i would bet my life she will never give a flying fuck) 

Getting legal custody is the outcome i want so I’m relieved it seems like a real possibility

Now i’m just trying doing a total overhaul of everything with the kids because i think they need a lot more structure, discipline, rules, routine than they have had until now. I have realised i dont really know anything about good parenting so i have a lot to learn. Maybe i will get some books. Until now our house has been more like a house share with everyone doing what they want and running around feral rather than anyone really guiding the kids. I grew up even more feral and i dont think its a good way to be raised. So i’m starting a bath and bedtime routine for the youngest two, and a curfew for the teenagers. Because rn the 12 year old goes off on his skateboard and will just show up again at like 10pm on a school night. I’ve also been giving them much better food than they usually have and its been rough to get them to eat healthy but we have made so much progress already. 

Any advice on instilling rules would be welcome as I dont think it will be easy and i have never had any kind of actual parent role model in my life ","Annemle telefonda konuştum ve ona geri dönmeyi reddettiği veya ne zaman döneceğini söylemediği için çocukların velayetini bana vermesini istediğimi söyledim ve onun saçmalıklarıyla işim bitti bir saat kadar tartıştık ama sonunda ona polisi arayacağımı söyledikten sonra yapacağını söyledi

Onunla konuşmadan önce bir avukatla görüştüm ve mahkemeye gidecek bir ebeveynlik emriyle yasal vesayet alabilmeliyim bir yaşındaki kardeşim eve taşınacağını ve annemin yanında olmayı reddettiği için geri dönmemesi koşuluyla bana yardım edeceğini söyledi geliri ve katkısı çok yardımcı olacak ve özellikle küçük kardeşimiz olmak üzere çocuklara bakmak ve ebeveynlik yapmak konusunda ciddi görünüyor çünkü erkek bir rol modele çok ihtiyacı var

Eğer velayeti alamazsak o zaman büyükannem her iki şekilde de alabilir annem aniden umursamaya karar vermediği sürece velayeti elinde tutması çok olası değil hayatımı bahse girerim asla umursamayacaktır

Yasal velayet almak istediğim sonuç bu yüzden rahatladım gibi görünüyor gerçek bir olasılık gibi

şimdi çocuklarla her şeyi tamamen elden geçirmeye çalışıyorum çünkü bence şu ana kadar sahip olduklarından çok daha fazla yapı disiplin kuralları rutine ihtiyaçları var iyi ebeveynlik hakkında gerçekten hiçbir şey bilmediğimi fark ettim bu yüzden öğreneceğim çok şey var belki biraz kitap alırım şimdiye kadar evimiz daha çok herkesin istediğini yaptığı ve çocukları gerçekten yönlendiren biri yerine vahşice koşturduğu bir ev paylaşımı gibiydi daha da vahşi büyüdüm ve bunun yetiştirilmenin iyi bir yolu olduğunu düşünmüyorum bu yüzden en küçük iki çocuk için bir banyo ve yatma vakti rutini ve gençler için bir sokağa çıkma yasağı başlattım çünkü bir yaşındaki çocuk kaykayıyla gidiyor ve okul gecesi öğleden sonra gibi tekrar ortaya çıkıyor ayrıca onlara normalde yediklerinden çok daha iyi yiyecekler veriyorum ve sağlıklı beslenmelerini sağlamak zor oldu ama şimdiden çok ilerleme kaydettik

"I’m 17 and pregnant being forced to keep my baby. My parents found out and they’ve told me that if I’m to get rid of the baby, they’re going to kick me out and cut contact. I have nowhere to go, I’ve got no job right now, no friends I can stay with, no money saved, my boyfriend left when he found out. If I keep the baby, they said I can stay but they’re not going to help me out financially. I don’t have the money to care for a child, I go days without eating because I have no food at home. I’ve done research and everything that I’d need is so expensive. I don’t know what i’m going to do. I’ve probably missed out certain things that I’d need for it too. I’m such a mess right now, I’m so lost and I’ve been placed in the most difficult situation I’ve ever had to deal with. I used contraception, my birth control didn’t work. I didn’t want this to happen, I’m not ready. How am I going to be able to support myself and a child? I’m not sure if I’ll even be able to get a job because of the pregnancy. I need help I don’t know what to do. I’m so sorry for asking like this. Does anyone have any advice for me, I’m struggling to figure this out on my own with no support.

Update: I have received so many messages, comments and helpful replies. Some of them aren’t so helpful but it’s the internet I can’t be picky. Thank you to everybody who has shown an interest and offered me support through this. A lot of people have privately messaged me offering to help me by sending me money, I hate that I’ve come to a point where I have to accept money from strangers which is why I ask everyone not to offer more than they can give. I have not accepted big donations as I do not want to feel like I’m taking advantage of kind people. I’m not asking for anyone to do this but for the people who already have or were thinking about it, I am so deeply thankful. 
I have not yet decided what I want to do, I’m overwhelmed with everything at the moment and think I need a short while to think through everything and make my own decision, one that I’m sure that I want.","Hamileyim ve bebeğimi doğurmaya zorlanıyorum, ailem öğrendi ve bana eğer bebeğimden kurtulursam beni evden atacaklarını ve iletişimi keseceklerini söylediler, gidecek hiçbir yerim yok, şu anda işim yok, arkadaşım yok, param yok, kalabilirim, erkek arkadaşım öğrendiğinde beni terk etti, eğer bebeği tutarsam kalabileceğimi söylediler ama bana maddi olarak yardım etmeyecekler, bir çocuğa bakacak param yok, evde yiyecek olmadığı için günlerce aç kalıyorum, araştırma yaptım ve ihtiyacım olan her şey çok pahalı, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, muhtemelen bunun için ihtiyacım olan bazı şeyleri de kaçırdım, şu anda çok karmaşa içindeyim, çok kayboldum ve şimdiye kadar başa çıkmak zorunda kaldığım en zor duruma düştüm, doğum kontrolü kullandım, doğum kontrolüm işe yaramadı, bunun olmasını istemedim, hazır değilim, kendime ve bir çocuğa nasıl bakacağım, hamileliğim nedeniyle bir iş bulabileceğimden bile emin değilim, yardıma ihtiyacım var, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, böyle sorduğum için çok özür dilerim, bana tavsiyesi olan var mı? kendi başıma bunu çözmeye çalışıyorum, destek yok

"UPDATE:

I hadn't had time to do this update but here it goes. 

First of all I want to thank a kind-hearted person who contacted me privately and sent a Crocs pair and an extra gift to my son. Thank you so much. It's the first time I’ve experienced kindness from someone unknown here on Reddit. 

Now I want to clarify some things, first, the price of the Crocs is about $60, but adding 3 pins (jibbitz) to each Croc, it became a total of $110. The idea of ​​the jibbitz was precisely to personalize his shoes and avoid losing them. And well, Crocs usually last my son around 2-3 years, and they are very versatile, so paying $60 for something that lasts a long time seems reasonable to me. 

The school did nothing. NOTHING. I tried to contact the people responsible for the summer camp, there was no response. I asked for the cameras, presumably only the ones at the entrance were working and when they had an activity there you can see my son with the Crocs on but when they go to the pool the cameras there “don't work.” They also told me that the cleaning service is subcontracted through a cleaning company, the staff is not directly employed by the school, so they only decided to notify this cleaning company about the loss and that they hoped that no one on their staff was responsible. Nothing else.

That was it. Thanks once again.


Hi everyone,

I’m feeling incredibly sad and disappointed, and I need to share an experience that happened to my 3-year-old autistic son during a summer camp at a private school (very expensive btw). 

He is autistic, level 1, very independent (can dress/undress himself, eating without problems, he knows what belongs to him, etc) with no sensory or aggressive issues, but he can’t communicate effectively. He can name colors, some objects, food, answer some simple yes/no questions and repeat almost everything but can’t have a conversation.

On Friday was “swimming pool day,” my son was wearing a brand new pair of Minions Crocs which he loved. During the activity, some adult from the school noticed that my son had an extra pair of shoes in his plastic backpack. Instead of taking care of him, this person decided to take away the brand new Crocs he was wearing and left him without shoes. Completely barefoot, something he would never do! 

When the Miss/teacher noticed him, she told me he was barefoot so she gave him the extra pair of crocs he had in his backpack. He NEVERS liked to walk around barefoot, never! Not even in a pool or the beach, so someone robbed him and since he’s not aggressive, and don’t cry easily, nobody notices it. And it was an adult that knew about his extra pair, since his backpack was plastic clear (I put him that backpack because it was swimming day so it made sense to me since he was going to have wet clothes)

Oh and each croc had a label sticker with his name on it, and also the letters jibbitz are his initials. 

It’s heartbreaking to think that a grown-up would take advantage of a ND toddler, especially one who can’t speak up for himself. I trusted this school to provide a safe and nurturing environment for my son, and this betrayal has left me feeling devastated. Their only answer was that they were going to send an email with the photo, asking other parents and school workers about it. They didn’t sent it. 

Never in his kindergarten something like this happened, NEVER! So I never thought that something like this could happen. Never occurred to me. Im naive. 

The minions crocs plus the 6 jibbitz were around $110 (I’m not in the US).  What makes it even worse is that nobody at the school is being held accountable for this incident, nor paying me back. 

I don’t have the money to buy them again and even if I had it, they’re sold out in his size, and sizes up. (Crocs US online store, Amazon, and the local store where I purchased them). 

My son keep repeating all weekend “yellow crocs, minion crocs” and I felt powerless. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? How did you handle it, and what steps did you take to ensure it never happened again? Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for reading.","güncelleme

bu güncellemeyi yapmak için zamanım olmamıştı ama işte burada

öncelikle bana özel olarak ulaşan ve oğlum için bir çift crocs ve ekstra bir hediye gönderen iyi kalpli birine teşekkür etmek istiyorum çok teşekkür ederim reddit'te tanımadığım birinden ilk kez nezaket gördüm

şimdi önce bazı şeyleri açıklığa kavuşturmak istiyorum crocs'un fiyatı yaklaşık olarak ne kadar ama her croc'a jibbitz iğneleri eklemek jibbitz fikrinin tam olarak ayakkabılarını kişiselleştirmek ve onları kaybetmemek olduğunu ve crocs'un oğlum için genellikle yıllarca dayandığını ve çok yönlü olduğunu, bu yüzden uzun süre dayanacak bir şey için ödeme yapmanın bana makul göründüğünü söyledi

okul hiçbir şey yapmadı yaz kampından sorumlu kişilerle iletişime geçmeye çalıştım hiçbir yanıt alamadım kameraları istedim muhtemelen sadece giriştekiler çalışıyordu ve orada bir etkinlik olduğunda oğlumu crocs'la görebiliyordunuz ama havuza gittiklerinde kameralar çalışmıyor ayrıca bana temizlik hizmetinin bir temizlik şirketi aracılığıyla taşeron olarak verildiğini söylediler personel doğrudan okul tarafından işe alındılar bu yüzden sadece bu temizlik şirketine kayıp hakkında bilgi vermeye karar verdiler ve personelinden kimsenin sorumlu olmadığını umduklarını söylediler başka bir şey yok

bu kadardı tekrar teşekkürler

herkese merhaba

inanılmaz derecede üzgün ve hayal kırıklığına uğramış hissediyorum ve özel bir okulda yaz kampı sırasında bir yaşındaki otistik oğlumun başına gelen bir deneyimi paylaşmam gerekiyor bu arada çok pahalı

otistik seviyede çok bağımsız kendi kendine giyinip soyunabiliyor sorunsuz yemek yiyebiliyor neyin kendisine ait olduğunu biliyor vs. duyusal veya saldırgan sorunları yok ama etkili bir şekilde iletişim kuramıyor renkleri ve bazı nesneleri isimlendirebiliyor yiyecekler bazı basit evet hayır sorularını cevaplayabiliyor ve neredeyse her şeyi tekrarlayabiliyor ama sohbet edemiyor

cuma günü yüzme havuzu günüydü oğlum aktivite sırasında çok sevdiği yepyeni bir çift minions crocs giyiyordu okuldan bir yetişkin oğlumun plastik sırt çantasında ona bakmak yerine fazladan bir çift ayakkabı olduğunu fark etti bu kişi giydiği yepyeni crocs'u almaya karar verdi ve onu tamamen çıplak ayak bıraktı bu asla yapmayacağı bir şeydi

öğretmen fark ettiğinde bana çıplak ayak olduğunu söyledi ve ona verdi sırt çantasında fazladan bir çift timsah vardı, çıplak ayakla dolaşmayı hiç sevmezdi, havuzda veya sahilde bile asla, bu yüzden biri onu soymuş ve saldırgan olmadığı ve kolay kolay ağlamadığı için kimse fark etmemiş ve sırt çantası plastik şeffaf olduğu için fazladan bir çift timsah olduğunu bilen bir yetişkindi, ona o sırt çantasını taktım çünkü yüzme günüydü, bu yüzden ıslak kıyafetleri olacağı için bana mantıklı geldi

ah ve her timsahın üzerinde adının yazılı olduğu bir etiket etiketi vardı ve ayrıca jibbitz harfleri baş harfleriydi

bir yetişkinin, özellikle de kendini ifade edemeyen bir yürümeye başlayan çocuktan faydalanması yürek parçalayıcıydı, oğlum için güvenli ve besleyici bir ortam sağlayacağına güvenmiştim ve bu ihanet beni perişan etti, tek cevapları, diğer ebeveynlere ve okul çalışanlarına fotoğrafla birlikte bir e-posta gönderecekleriydi, göndermediler

anaokulunda hiç böyle bir şey olmadı, hiç böyle bir şey olabileceğini düşünmedim, hiç aklıma gelmedi, safım

minyonlar timsahlar ve jibbitz etrafta ben abd'de değilim daha da kötüsü okulda hiç kimse bu olaydan sorumlu tutulmuyor veya bana geri ödeme yapmıyor

tekrar satın alacak param yok ve olsa bile kendi bedeninde ve daha büyük bedenlerde tükenmiş durumda crocs us online mağazası amazon ve satın aldığım yerel mağaza

oğlum bütün hafta sonu yellow crocs minion crocs'u tekrarlamaya devam etti ve kendimi güçsüz hissettim

başka biri de böyle bir şey yaşadı mı? Siz nasıl başa çıktınız ve bir daha asla olmamasını sağlamak için hangi adımları attınız? Herhangi bir tavsiye veya destek çok takdir edilecektir

okuduğunuz için teşekkür ederim"
"My daughter (18f) went ""out with her friends"" yesterday and got home late. She was, instead, going out with this guy (18m). At some point during the night, they came to the barbecue area of our condominium and probably spent a lot of time there.

I have a habit of going out for midnight strolls around the condominium when I can’t sleep, so I’m assuming you already know what happened next.

I pass by the barbecue area and see the two of them making out. 
I’m stunned. My daughter never had any reason to lie to me, I’ve always given her the freedom she seemingly deserved and now I see this. I froze completely and just say ""hello."" 
The two jumped apart with absolute horror on their faces. She sent the guy home straight after that and walked back into the apartment after I left.

She sent me a text apologising, saying that she understands if I don’t want to speak to her right now and that she deeply regrets having disappointed me and lied to me. I didn’t reply.

Morning rolls around and she doesn’t leave her room. She hasn’t left the whole day. I know she’s there, because I can hear her, but I don’t know what to do. I feel quite betrayed, but also feel shitty for the situation we’re in now. How should I approach this?

Edit: thank you so much for all of your responses. I want to make it clear that my goal isn’t to punish her or anything of the sort. She’s an adult, and I wasn’t in her life enough to feel like I should (even though I have absolutely no desire or need to) punish her. 

All I want to do is strengthen our relationship and provide her with as much support as I can provide, but I was just surprised by what I saw and am not sure how to go about it, since this is such a new relationship. (She’s only moved in a few months ago).","kızım dün arkadaşlarıyla dışarı çıktı ve eve geç geldi, bunun yerine bu adamla dışarı çıkıyordu, gecenin bir vakti apartmanımızın barbekü alanına geldiler ve muhtemelen orada çok zaman geçirdiler

barbekü alanının yanından geçiyorum ve ikisinin öpüştüğünü görüyorum

şaşkınım kızımın bana yalan söylemek için hiçbir nedeni olmadı, ona her zaman hak ettiği özgürlüğü verdim ve şimdi bunu görünce tamamen donup kaldım ve sadece merhaba dedim

ikisi de yüzlerinde mutlak bir dehşetle birbirlerinden uzaklaştı, adamı hemen eve gönderdi ve ben ayrıldıktan sonra daireye geri döndü

bana özür dileyen bir mesaj attı, eğer şu anda onunla konuşmak istemezsem anladığını ve beni hayal kırıklığına uğrattığı ve bana yalan söylediği için çok pişman olduğunu söyledi, cevap vermedim

"My gf and I have been together for a few months now, and recently we’ve been discussing sex for the first time. As soon as I mentioned that I was uncut, she was horrified - refusing to have sex with me until I circumcised it first. She claimed that by being uncut I could give her sexual infections, and I made the situation worse by saying I would never circumcise my children. Now she’s really angry at me for not wanting to circumcise my kids, the relationship is turning sour and we haven’t spoke in over 24 hours.

2 things I need advice with: 1, is the anything I can do to fix the relationship? Should I just circumcise anyway to save face? 2, I’m not sure how I’d give her a sexual infection when I’m a virgin - does she just hate uncut penises, or maybe it’s a religious tradition?

Thanks for reading 😀

Edit: an hour has gone by, and I brought this up again. At first she ignored it and refused to talk about it, but now it’s another argument. All responses I get, including responses people from here told me to use, are either her paraphrasing the original point, or sending laugh emojis to me. At one point, she said that women only want circumcised men since it feels better - but to be honest, I don’t care anymore. She’s completely ignoring any research papers I’m sending, instead trying to put her opinions onto me instead, and is completely in denial - it’s like I’m dealing with a conspiracy theorist. I’m out of here and blocking her. Thanks everyone for the help! 😀

Edit2: the next day and she is trying to add me on multiple alt accounts; oh dear I think I found myself a crazy. Hopefully my windows aren’t smashed in a few days.","kız arkadaşımla birkaç aydır birlikteyiz ve yakın zamanda ilk kez seks hakkında konuşuyorduk, sünnetsiz olduğumu söylediğim anda dehşete kapıldı, sünnet edene kadar benimle seks yapmayı reddetti, sünnetsiz olduğumda ona cinsel enfeksiyon bulaştırabileceğimi iddia etti ve ben de çocuklarımı asla sünnet etmeyeceğimi söyleyerek durumu daha da kötüleştirdim, şimdi çocuklarımın sünnetini yaptırmak istemediğim için bana çok kızgın, ilişkimiz kötüye gidiyor ve saatlerdir konuşmuyoruz

"I work in a kitchen at a restaurant, and after catering sometimes we have left over food. One of my coworkers suggested giving containers of leftovers to the homeless.
 I thought it was an amazing idea, so I asked my boyfriend (he’s also a coworker of mine) if we could, and he freaked out on me. He said fuck the homeless, they decided to fuck up their lives so why should we help them. I stared at him in disbelief, and something clicked inside me. I understand his point of view, but a lot of homeless people haven’t done stuff to fuck up their lives, they just have had it rough. I’m someone who loves doing good and making other people happy.

"I (14F) recently had another kid (14M) make a joke about raping me. We were given instructions by the director, which I did not hear, and he turned to me and said “do it or I’m gonna rape you”. Everyone around heard it, and immediately got weirded out and started whispering to each other. I wasn’t that bothered at first, but one of the other kids in my section told me to report him to one of the techs, which I did later on. He ended up getting in trouble, and apologizing. He claimed to not know what that word meant, but I’m not so sure if he’s telling the truth.

I also found out, 2 days after that happened, that he is autistic. Ever since I told people who knew about the situation that, they’ve starting saying “well it’s not that bad then” and making light of it because he’s autistic. I still feel so uncomfortable about the situation, and don’t want to be around him at all, but everyone else is saying it’s not that big of a deal since I told them that. Should I feel the same way, and try to forget about the whole thing?

Edit: He did it again yesterday. We had practice again, and while we were on the field, he turned to me and said “I’m gonna *pause* you. I’m not gonna say the actual word, but you know what I mean.” I was shocked and just waited till the set was over to find my friend, and go to the assistant director again. I told her what happened and she spoke with him and made him apologize (not very sincerely, of course). Around 20 minutes later, we were back on the field, and he got angry at me and asked why I kept telling on him. I told him he was being inappropriate and rude, and asked why he said that and he replied “I can’t get it out of my head”. He  then tried to say that “it was directed towards another kid” who just happened to be across the field. I told him that he looked me in the eyes and said it, and that I know it was towards me. He got angry and went silent. At the end of rehearsal, I went to my director and told him everything, to which he replied with the usual “I’ll speak to him and his parents”. 

I told my dad after rehearsal, and he was furious. He had me go to the police and file a statement with him, but as of right now, it’s technically not harassment. My dad also went and spoke with some of the administrators at my school today, and when I got in the car with him after school, they called him back and spoke with him about the incident. They said “he’s been dealt with and I’m sure nothing will happen again”, and that he wouldn’t been kicked out of the band unless he did it again, to which my dad got even angrier about. My parents are getting a lawyer.","i if yakın zamanda başka bir çocuk bana tecavüz etmekle ilgili şaka yaptı yönetmenden talimat aldık duymadım ve bana dönüp yap yoksa sana tecavüz ederim dedi etraftaki herkes duydu ve hemen ürktü ve birbirimize fısıldamaya başladık ilk başta çok rahatsız olmadım ama bölümümdeki diğer çocuklardan biri bana onu teknisyenlerden birine bildirmemi söyledi daha sonra yaptım sonunda başını belaya soktu ve özür diledi o kelimenin ne anlama geldiğini bilmediğini iddia etti ama doğruyu söyleyip söylemediğinden emin değilim

"I (19F) gave birth to a baby boy in August. He is a sweet amazing little boy. I do love him. I just can’t help but have these overwhelming feelings of wanting to get away from him. I do love him and want him to have a good life, but I never wanted to be a mother. When I found out I was pregnant my boyfriend (22M) and I initially agreed I would have an abortion. He was pro choice before but once my appointment came up he changed he is mind. He asked me not to get an abortion and said he really wants this baby. I was reluctant but chose to not go to the appointment. However I did schedule another abortion later because I really knew in my heart I didn’t want a child. Again my boyfriend begged me not to and said it was wrong. I caved and chose not to, but I regretted it and felt like I made the wrong decision my entire pregnancy.

 Fast forward to now, all I do is think about what my life could’ve been. What it should’ve been. I wanted to go to college, make new friends, branch out and explore/experience the world. It all got ripped away from me, I am now a stay at home mom who does nothing but care for my baby. He is a good baby to be honest, he is great actually. I just don’t want this, I never wanted this. Ive been diagnosed with PPD/PPA which I expected because I was already depressed and anxious before having a child. All I think about is leaving. I just feel like im wrong for wanting to leave. My family loves my son and I think they would look down on me for leaving. Same with my boyfriend’s family. His family is great and I just feel like they would frown upon such a decision. I am scared to talk about this to people in my life. I just want to know, is what im feeling wrong? Would it be bad of me to leave and just pay child support to my boyfriend?

 My boyfriend does know how I feel I told him this during and after my pregnancy, he thinks im being weak. I chose to not breast feed after two weeks of trying. I stopped because it was harming my mental health. He thinks im being weak for that too, he said his mom and sister EBF with no problem and that “millions of other women have too”. He makes me feel terrible about it. I want to leave, however I have a hard time actually making the decision to pick up and leave. I feel like a bad person. Im just so depressed. Im sitting in the shower typing this crying and wondering why I ever decided to have this baby. Please help.

"My crazy exhusband is on the warpath again.

He likes to come over unannounced and kick off. To deter him, I told him my boyfriend has moved in. He hasn't but he does live close by should anything bad happen.

In the meantime I know my exhusband will come around snooping. If he thinks a man is actually there, he won't bother me. He's a typical abusive exhusband who is happy to start fights with women, but quakes in his boots when it comes to men.

The only idea Ive had so far is to place some mens workboots outside the front door. Anything else? He can easily look inside the windows to the hallway and kitchen if he wants, anything I can put in there???

Yes the police have been informed many times and he is known to them. I have back up, I'm just after advice on a deterrent.

TIA!

Update: I didn't expect such a response! Thank you all for your help.

I should have mentioned in my post that I am in the UK so can't just go buy a gun.

Also he does have a restraining order that he keeps breaking. He's just out of custody for breaking the previous one, I have no doubt he will do it again. He has mental health issues and thinks himself above the law.

He doesn't have access to the house. But my front door and windows are right out onto the street so there's nothing stopping him looking in the windows.

I just bought this house only 3 months ago. I am unable to just move.

Thank you for such helpful tips! Much has been implemented and I'm feeling that little bit safer.

"I have been dating this guy for about 2months, he was over on the weekend and we were having a few drinks with friends, he leaves to go to the toilet and I kid you not I could smell it from the living room! However that didn’t put me off as I understand he probably just had a upset stomach, through out the night he goes to the toilet atleast 6 times in the span of 3-4 hours and each time does a bomb to the point my other guests didn’t want to use my toilet anymore as it was blocked lol But like I said i gave him the benefit of the doubt due to him probably having an upset stomach, but what didn’t make sense to me was he kept on drinking beer to the point he had atleast 7-8pints ! 

Fast forward to bedtime, he is drunk! we already planned for him to stay over, but at like 3am he wakes me up to tell me he just shat himself! And that he needs to wash his boxers! At his big big age (we are both 29) i felt disgusted and asked him to wash his boxers by hand as I couldn’t fathom putting them in the wash with my other clothes, he washes it by hand but than has the audacity to ask if he can put it on my radiator to dry.

Now it’s the next morning and I have the biggest ick but than has the audacity to fart in the bed first thing in the morning and this fart smelt like shit as let’s not forget he just shat himself few hours ago and didn’t even shower! I shouldn’t have to ask you to! All night i dodged his cuddles and slept on my side and I think he realised I was giving him the cold shoulder.

I truly cannot look at him the same way, I am disgusted,I don’t want to see him again and not sure how to tell him it’s because of that, this happened 2 days ago so it is still fresh in my mind, any advice ? 


 ps
I noticed he didn’t shower because once I woke up I checked my wardrobe to count my towels and they were untouched, so he couldn’t have showered.

Ps 
He left without saying a word whilst I was in bed, I think he knows exactly what he did and why I was being off with him.

Update: he texted me asking “what did I do wrong, you were being off with me all weekend?” Clearly he has no self awareness so I think I will have to just tell him straight? ","bu adamla yaklaşık aylardır çıkıyorum hafta sonu geldi ve arkadaşlarla birkaç içki içiyorduk tuvalete gitmek için ayrıldı ve şaka yapmıyorum oturma odasından kokusunu alabiliyordum ancak bu beni caydırmadı çünkü anladığım kadarıyla muhtemelen gece boyunca midesi bozulmuştu tuvalete en azından birkaç saat içinde gidiyor ve her seferinde öyle bir bomba yapıyor ki diğer misafirlerim tuvaletim tıkalı olduğu için artık kullanmak istemiyor lol ama dediğim gibi muhtemelen midesi bozulduğu için ona şüphe duyma ayrıcalığını tanıdım ancak benim için mantıklı olmayan şey en azından bira içtiği noktaya kadar bira içmeye devam etmesiydi

yatma saatine hızlıca ilerleyin sarhoş zaten gece kalmasını planlamıştık ama sabah gibi beni uyandırıp az önce altına sıçtığını ve boxer'larını yıkaması gerektiğini söylüyor bu yaşta ikimiz de iğrendim ve boxer'larını elde yıkamasını istedim çünkü onları diğer kıyafetlerimle birlikte yıkamaya koyamazdım elde yıkıyor ama sonra

şimdi ertesi sabah ve bende en büyük iğrençlik var ama sabahın erken saatlerinde yatakta osurmaya cüret ediyor ve bu osuruk bok gibi kokuyordu, unutmayalım ki birkaç saat önce sıçtı ve duş bile almadı, bütün gece senden bunu istememeliyim, onun kucaklamalarından kaçtım ve yan yattım ve sanırım ona soğuk davrandığımı fark etti

ona aynı şekilde bakamıyorum, tiksiniyorum, onu tekrar görmek istemiyorum ve ona bunun sebebinin bu olduğunu nasıl söyleyeceğimi bilmiyorum, bu birkaç gün önce oldu, bu yüzden hala aklımda taze herhangi bir tavsiye

ps
duş almadığını fark ettim çünkü uyandığımda havlularımı saymak için gardırobumu kontrol ettim ve dokunulmamışlardı, bu yüzden duş almış olamazdı

I don’t even remember my reaction because I was so scared why I stayed with him after this? Idk. But he of course said he was just kidding it wasn’t pointed at me. He stopped doing it we moved on, now he has started to bring out his ar-15 which has now been pointed at me 3 times and his dog.

She gets nightmares and when ever we are almost having intimacy she gets scared and starts to apologize because of her fear. I love her and I don’t care if she doesn’t feel comfortable with sex, she deserves the world and if shes scared or starts to cry I would stop and hug her immediately. Last night we had intimacy for the first time in our whole relationship. it was slow but I didn’t see any signs of her getting scared, I asked her before doing anything and she said yes. After she had an orgasm we stopped and she left the room in a hurry and started to cry in the bathroom. I knocked and tried talking to her but she wouldn’t answer.

"So this weekend I attended a friends wedding. I was one of his groomsmen along with 2 other guys.

Background:

Ive know my friend since I was 15 im now 25 (10 years) I first met him in highschool. 

When he was 19 he went to uni and thats were he met his now... wife.

During his time in uni, he met new people (friends) and I was doing my own thing (engineering apprenticeship) so we didnt meet up as often, maybe a few times a year but stayed in contact over socials.

The story:

Dude gets up to deliver his groom speech and says all the normal things youd expect a groom to say, it was all very lighthearted and then towards the end of his speech this is what he says:

""This has been a long time coming, ive known my girlfriend 4 years. Im still shocked my friend (me) has been with his girlfriend 9 years and he still hasnt got down on one fucking knee and popped the question""

The atmosphere in the room changed. The tone he said it in set the mood.

Ive been with my girlfriend since i was 16, shes training to be a doctor still, Im still studying engineering (HNC) and we always wanted to get a house before we got engaged and married, we are still working towards this and are very much happy.

I felt like this was a shitty thing to say, it seemed competitive and a below the belt jab, it felt like he was trying to embarass me as if im not ""man enough"".

I can take banter, im not sensitive in the slightest bit but it made my girlfriend feel like shit aswell cause we very much have our own struggle. Its as if we were the butt of the single joke he had.

I wanted to say something to him, tell him it was out of order, he done it in a position of power (his fckin wedding day) obviously im socially aware and have decency so I didnt want to put a downer on his special day. 

But now the wedding is done and I feel he needs to know that was a really shitty thing to do. 

Am I over-reacting? how do I address it?

I wanted to call him a piece of shit and kill the friendship tbh! It felt that bad, especially when he knows the challenges ive had within my family life that have set me back.

What do the people of reddit think?





","bu hafta sonu bir arkadaşımın düğününe katıldım, diğer adamlarla birlikte sağdıçlarından biriydim

geçmiş

arkadaşımı lisedeyken tanıdığımdan beri tanıyorum

o üniversiteye gittiğinde ve şimdiki karısıyla orada tanıştı

üniversitedeyken yeni insanlarla tanıştı, arkadaşlar ve ben kendi işimi yapıyordum, mühendislik çıraklığı, bu yüzden çok sık görüşmüyorduk, belki yılda birkaç kez ama sosyal medyada iletişim halindeydik

hikaye

adam damat konuşmasını yapmak için ayağa kalktı ve bir damadın söylemesini bekleyeceğiniz tüm normal şeyleri söyledi, hepsi çok neşeliydi ve konuşmasının sonuna doğru şunları söyledi

bu uzun zamandır beklenen bir şeydi, kız arkadaşımı yıllardır tanıyorum, hala şoktayım, arkadaşım kız arkadaşıyla yıllardır birlikte ve hala tek dizinin üzerine çöküp evlenme teklifi etmedi

odadaki atmosfer tonu değiştirdi, havayı ayarladı

kız arkadaşımla 1980'li yıllardan beri birlikteyim, doktor olmak için eğitim alıyor, hala mühendislik okuyorum hnc ve nişanlanmadan ve evlenmeden önce her zaman bir ev sahibi olmak istedik, hala bunun için çalışıyoruz ve çok mutluyuz

Bunu söylemenin berbat bir şey olduğunu hissettim, rekabetçi ve belden aşağı bir şaka gibi görünüyordu, sanki yeterince erkek değilmişim gibi beni utandırmaya çalışıyormuş gibi hissettim

Şakalaşmaya dayanabilirim, en ufak bir hassasiyetim yok ama kız arkadaşımı da berbat hissettirdi çünkü kendi mücadelemiz var, sanki onun yaptığı bekar şakasının hedefi bizmişiz gibi

Ona bir şey söylemek istedim, ona bunun sıra dışı olduğunu söylemek istedim, bunu güçlü bir pozisyonda yaptı, onun düğün günü belli ki sosyal olarak farkındayım ve terbiyeliyim, bu yüzden onun özel gününü mahvetmek istemedim

Ama şimdi düğün bitti ve bunun gerçekten berbat bir şey olduğunu bilmesi gerektiğini hissediyorum

Abartılı mı tepki veriyorum, bunu nasıl ele almalıyım

Açıkçası ona pislik demek ve arkadaşlığımızı bitirmek istedim, özellikle de aile hayatımda yaşadığım zorlukları bildiğinde çok kötü hissettim, beni mahvetti geri

My teenage daughter, 15, got pregnant 2 months ago. She does not want to do abortion because of personal feelings that she doesn't want to share. She hasn't been eating or gotten out of bed that much, ahe talks about the unborn baby like it's the worst being in the world. I need advice on what to do. Both of us are at a loss right now, and I could use some advice.  I've given her space, I've tried to talk, but nothing is working. I understand she's in a dark place right now, but I just want to help. Any advice?

Edit: I kind of forgot to add that it wasn't her choice to have intimacy. She was raped, and the baby's dad is in prison for charges of raping my daughter. I also obviously know that her being raped is obviously a big factor of her not wanting the baby. I'm just asking for advice on how to help her.","bunu yayınlamak için izin aldım

He's the face of our company and this is a bad image. We have no HR in the company to go through. How do I tell him about it without 1. being inappropriate and 2. letting him in on the fact that I went through his following?

"My friend, 22F lost her apartment in a house fire two weeks ago,  including all of her belongings, and immediately i offered for her to stay with me as her relationship with her family is strained. When she first moved, she couldn’t bring anything with her as everything she had was basically destroyed in the fire. So of course, i lent her my things, and we even went shopping together. Over the next few days, as I would be going about my morning routine as usual, i’d notice my hairbrush would be misplaced, often being put on my vanity instead of the bathroom counter where i typically keep it, or beside my bed, which was incredibly confusing.. and often when I would find it and use it, there would be a faint, slightly fishy and metallic odour on my hands after, and I’d have to wash them. 

Yesterday I came home early from work, and as I walked up the stairs, i noticed the bathroom door was open, and my friend was quickly scrambling, putting my hairbrush back, and pulling up her pants. Immediately I connected the dots. I didn’t know how to confront her, and I really didn’t want to, but I felt like this was a total violation of my respect and boundaries.. That night as we were washing dishes I just asked, “Were you using my hairbrush to masturbate?” and immediately she got defensive and flustered. I told her to stop and that it was my hairbrush, and she just shook her head and denied it. I told her about how I noticed the smell on the handle of my hairbrush these past few days and she was incredibly offended, accusing her of being “unhygienic” so then i said, “So you did use it..” and she walked out. I’m writing this the next day, in the afternoon, she’s blocked me on everything and i’m assuming she went to her moms house or her ex’s… I feel guilty but idk… I feel like it was really unnecessary for me to mention the smell on the handle but i’m just so confused as to why she would use my hairbrush… I need advice on how to handle this further on, should I let her stay?


Update: 
this sort of blew up and i’m praying she doesn’t see this because i know she has a reddit aswell 😭 so basically, i found out she was with her ex, and has basically unblocked me and called me, sobbing asking me why id accuse her of something like this, and why I would accuse her of rape.. which.. i didn’t? I explained that i didn’t mean to ask her the question so abruptly, and she just said she hasn’t been in the right headspace, that she’s lost her home and everything and for me to take away her sexual freedom felt so appalling.. but i didn’t.. she can masturbate all she wants.. just don’t use my hairbrush.. ","arkadaşım iki hafta önce bir ev yangınında dairesini ve tüm eşyalarını kaybetti ve hemen benimle kalmasını teklif ettim çünkü ailesiyle ilişkisi ilk taşındığında gergindi, yangında sahip olduğu her şey temelde yok olduğu için hiçbir şey getiremedi, bu yüzden elbette ona eşyalarımı ödünç verdim ve hatta birkaç gün boyunca birlikte alışverişe bile gittik çünkü her zamanki gibi sabah rutinimi yaparken saç fırçamın yanlış yerde olduğunu fark ettim, genellikle banyo tezgahına veya yatağımın yanına koymak yerine makyaj masamın üzerine koyuyordum, bu inanılmaz derecede kafa karıştırıcıydı ve genellikle onu bulup kullandığımda ellerimde hafif balık ve metalik bir koku olurdu ve onları yıkamak zorunda kalırdım

dün işten erken eve geldim ve merdivenlerden çıkarken banyo kapısının açık olduğunu ve arkadaşımın hızla saç fırçamı geri koyup pantolonunu hemen yukarı çektiğini fark ettim, noktaları birleştirdim, onunla nasıl yüzleşeceğimi bilmiyordum ve gerçekten de bunu yapmak istemiyordum ama o gece bunun saygımın ve sınırlarımın tamamen ihlal edildiğini hissettim, çünkü bulaşık yıkıyordum, sadece mastürbasyon yapmak için saç fırçamı mı kullandığını sordum ve hemen savunmaya geçti ve telaşlandı, ona durmasını ve bunun benim saç fırçam olduğunu söyledim ve sadece başını salladı ve reddetti, ona son birkaç gündür saç fırçamın sapındaki kokuyu nasıl fark ettiğimi anlattım ve onu hijyenik olmadığıyla suçlayarak inanılmaz derecede kırılmıştı, sonra ben de kullandığını söyledim ve o da gitti, bunu ertesi gün öğleden sonra yazıyorum, beni her yerden engellemiş ve annesinin evine veya eski sevgilisine gittiğini varsayıyorum, suçlu hissediyorum ama bilmiyorum, sapındaki kokudan bahsetmem gerçekten gereksizmiş gibi hissediyorum ama saç fırçamı neden kullandığını anlamıyorum, bunu daha sonra nasıl halledebileceğim konusunda tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var, kalmasına izin vermeli miyim?

Ona bu soruyu bu kadar ani sormak istemediğimi açıkladım ve o da sadece doğru ruh halinde olmadığını, evini ve her şeyini kaybettiğini ve onun cinsel özgürlüğünü elinden almamın çok korkunç olduğunu söyledi ama istemedim, istediği kadar mastürbasyon yapabilir, sadece saç fırçamı kullanma"
"My boyfriend and I have been together for years but he keeps saying “emergency” for things that are not emergency. For example, he texted me emergency while I was on the phone with someone important and I hung up because I was concerned that something was an actual emergency. (I also feel like I should mention that we are both in our early twenties)In reality it was not an emergency he just wanted me to come downstairs to hangout with him. I told him that although I think it’s cute that he wants to spend time with me he needs to stop saying emergency for things that are not an emergency. However he keeps doing this and I’ve told him repeatedly that he should stop because everything he does this I drop everything by out of concern but he keeps doing it. It’s gotten so bad that he texted my sister “emergency” just because he wanted her to come downstairs to play a game. Then when my sister found out it wasn’t an emergency she got annoyed that he called something that wasn’t an emergency and emergency. I had a talk with him and I told him that he should apologize to my sister for doing this he said “fuck no.” ",Erkek arkadaşım ve ben yıllardır birlikteyiz ama o acil olmayan şeyler için sürekli acil durum diyor örneğin önemli biriyle telefonda konuşurken bana acil durum mesajı attı ve bir şeyin gerçekten acil bir durum olduğundan endişelendiğim için telefonu kapattım ayrıca ikimizin de yirmili yaşlarının başında olduğumuzu söylemem gerektiğini düşünüyorum gerçekte bu bir acil durum değildi sadece aşağı inip onunla takılmamı istedi ona zaman geçirmek istemesini sevimli bulsam da acil olmayan şeyler için acil durum demeyi bırakması gerektiğini söyledim ama bunu yapmaya devam ediyor ve ona durması gerektiğini defalarca söyledim çünkü yaptığı her şeyde endişelendiğim için her şeyi bırakıyorum ama bunu yapmaya devam ediyor o kadar kötü oldu ki kız kardeşime sadece aşağı inip oyun oynamasını istediği için acil durum mesajı attı sonra kız kardeşim bunun acil bir durum olmadığını öğrendiğinde acil durum ve acil durum olmayan bir şeyi aradığı için sinirlendi onunla konuştum ve bunu yaptığı için kız kardeşimden özür dilemesi gerektiğini söyledim o da hayır dedi
"Yes, I'm an adult. And yes, I feel as embarassed as this post title sounds so this is a throwaway account.

It started three years ago when I set up a small business. My niece began to make cheeky remarks about the job that I do (it's nothing particularly interesting, strange or funny). At first, I approached this with humor even though I found some of the comments grating. I then started ignoring some of the ruder remarks, hoping that not paying attention to the rudeness would make it stop. I thought she would run out of steam eventually but the comments kept coming and became more mocking. I tried to have a conversation with her about this but it carried on.

She then began to email me through my website. Obviously I guessed it was her and I asked her to stop because I was trying to collect data on website visitors for my business plan. The emails stopped but the website visits continued which messed up the analytics. Around the same time, my niece began to shout stuff at me in the street e.g. ""Look, there she goes, the (my professional title). I found this embarassing, especially when she would encourage other children to do this. Again, I asked her to stop this. It turned into pointing and snickering instead.

I have heard her make comments about my weight  (I'm of average weight), my clothes (pretty normal) and my appearance. My own child has called her out on this and asked her to stop. My partner invited my niece for a sleepover and she deliberately walked into my bedroom while I was in my underwear after I had asked her not to come into my room. I lost my temper at that point. Her response was to laugh in my face and I sent her straight home.

The latest thing is to poke fun at a particular phobia that I have. She will begin talking about it to other family members in front of me while side-eyeing me to gauge my reaction. To anyone else, it looks like nothing but my niece knows about this phobia and I know she is talking about it on purpose. She even took the piss out of a close friend of mine dying which is absolutely the final straw for me. 

I'm at a loss on how to handle this now. It's honestly relentless because we live very nearby and so I see my niece in the street pretty much every day. And it happens EVERY time. Hundreds and hundreds of times, no exaggeration. It's really brought me down and I feel like I have tried almost everything to stop this. 

I feel so stupid and powerless because I feel bullied by a literal child. Her parents are aware of it but it's massively downplayed within the family. There have also been issues with my niece lying and bullying other children at school. Again, this is downplayed.

I don't understand why this began happening and why it hasn't stopped. I have been close to my niece in the past and we had lots of fun together when she was little. I have tried talking to my partner but they tell me that she's just a child who doesn't know what she's saying. I disagree to an extent because my niece knows what she's saying and what she says feels like it has hurtful intentions. I know she's a young child who is pushing boundaries but this has become way too much and gone on for way too long. Any advice or similar experience would be very greatly appreciated!


EDIT: Thank you for the responses - it's helpful to get some alternative views! To answer some questions:

1) My business is in the medical field. It has grown a lot since I set up. I'm very direct and focused at work and good at my job, but I struggle with family relations. My partner's family is chaos. 

2) My niece is my in-laws' child. My partner recognises that there is something not right but gets defensive about their family. My niece is the 'golden child' of the family and is given much more attention than the other children.

3) As some of you have rightfully pointed out, her parents are worse than useless. Speaking to them has not worked and I keep my distance from them. I used to feel very sorry for my niece. She didn't choose to have shitty parents BUT she is choosing to behave like this towards me. If she was my bio kid, there would be serious consequences and punishment but her parents do nothing. I'm extremely concerned about behaviour towards kids at school too(school are dealing with this). 

4) Nothing bad has happened between me and my niece. I've been in therapy for a long time (no mental health issues - it's healthy to have a space to talk) and I've reflected on this situation and myself with my therapist for months now. If I had done something, either me or my therapist would have worked it out. Even he is confused by it all.

","evet ben bir yetişkinim ve evet bu yazının başlığı kadar utanıyorum bu yüzden bu bir atılabilir hesap

üç yıl önce küçük bir iş kurduğumda başladı yeğenim yaptığım iş hakkında küstahça yorumlar yapmaya başladı özellikle ilginç bir şey değil ilk başta garip ya da komik bazı yorumları sinir bozucu bulmama rağmen buna mizahla yaklaştım sonra daha kaba yorumları görmezden gelmeye başladım kabalığa dikkat etmemenin bunu durduracağını umarak sonunda tükeneceğini düşündüm ama yorumlar gelmeye devam etti ve daha alaycı hale geldi onunla bu konuda bir konuşma yapmaya çalıştım ama devam etti

sonra bana web sitem üzerinden e-posta göndermeye başladı belli ki oydu tahmin ettim ve durmasını istedim çünkü iş planım için web sitesi ziyaretçileriyle ilgili veri toplamaya çalışıyordum e-postalar durdu ama web sitesi ziyaretleri devam etti bu da analitiği bozdu aynı zamanda yeğenim sokakta bana bağırmaya başladı örneğin bak işte mesleki ünvanım gidiyor bunu utanç verici buldum özellikle diğer çocukları bunu tekrar yapmaya teşvik ettiğinde ona sordum bunu durdurmak için işaret edip kıkırdamaya başladı

Onun kilom hakkında yorumlar yaptığını duydum, ortalama kilodayım, kıyafetlerim oldukça normal ve görünüşüm de oldukça normal, kendi çocuğum onu ​​bu konuda uyardı ve durmasını istedi, partnerim yeğenimi pijama partisine davet etti ve odama girmemesini söylememe rağmen iç çamaşırlarımla yatak odama bilerek girdi, o noktada sinirlendim, tepkisi yüzüme gülmek oldu ve onu doğruca eve gönderdim

Son şey, sahip olduğum belirli bir fobiyle dalga geçmek oldu, tepkimi ölçmek için bana yan gözle bakarken önümde diğer aile üyeleriyle bundan bahsetmeye başlıyor, yeğenim bu fobiyi biliyor gibi görünüyor ve bunun hakkında bilerek konuştuğunu biliyorum, hatta yakın bir arkadaşımın ölümüyle bile dalga geçti, bu benim için kesinlikle bardağı taşıran son damla

Şimdi bununla nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum, dürüst olmak gerekirse acımasız çünkü çok yakınlarda yaşıyoruz ve bu yüzden yeğenimi neredeyse her gün sokakta görüyorum ve her seferinde yüzlerce ve yüzlerce kez oluyor, hayır abartma beni gerçekten yıprattı ve bunu durdurmak için neredeyse her şeyi denediğimi hissediyorum

gerçek bir çocuk tarafından zorbalığa uğradığımı hissettiğim için kendimi çok aptal ve güçsüz hissediyorum ebeveynleri bunun farkında ama aile içinde bu çok önemsizleştiriliyor ayrıca yeğenimin okulda yalan söylemesi ve diğer çocuklara zorbalık yapmasıyla ilgili sorunlar da oldu bu önemsizleştiriliyor

bunun neden olmaya başladığını ve neden durmadığını anlamıyorum geçmişte yeğenime yakındım ve küçükken birlikte çok eğlenmiştik partnerimle konuşmaya çalıştım ama bana ne söylediğini bilmeyen bir çocuk olduğunu söylediler bir dereceye kadar katılmıyorum çünkü yeğenim ne söylediğini biliyor ve söyledikleri sanki incitici niyetler taşıyormuş gibi geliyor sınırları zorlayan küçük bir çocuk olduğunu biliyorum ama bu çok fazla oldu ve çok uzun sürdü herhangi bir tavsiye veya benzer deneyim çok takdir edilecektir

düzenleme yanıtlar için teşekkür ederim bazı soruları yanıtlamak için alternatif görüşler almak yardımcı oluyor

işim tıp alanında, kurduğumdan beri çok büyüdü işimde çok direkt ve odaklanmış biriyim ve işimde iyiyim ama aile ilişkilerimde zorlanıyorum partnerimin ailesi kaos içinde 

yeğenim kayınvalidemin çocuğu partnerim bir şeylerin doğru olmadığını fark ediyor ama ailesi konusunda savunmaya geçiyor yeğenim ailenin altın çocuğu ve diğer çocuklardan çok daha fazla ilgi görüyor 

bazılarınızın haklı olarak belirttiği gibi ebeveynleri işe yaramazdan da beter onlarla konuşmak işe yaramadı ve onlardan uzak duruyorum yeğenim için çok üzülüyordum o kötü ebeveynleri olmayı seçmedi ama bana karşı böyle davranmayı seçiyor eğer biyolojik çocuğum olsaydı ciddi sonuçlar ve cezalar olurdu ama ebeveynleri hiçbir şey yapmıyor okulda da çocuklara karşı davranışlar konusunda aşırı endişeliyim okul bununla başa çıkıyor 

yeğenim ile aramda kötü bir şey olmadı uzun zamandır terapi görüyorum hiçbir ruh sağlığı sorunum yok konuşmak için bir alan olması sağlıklı ve aylardır terapistimle bu durum ve kendim hakkında düşünüyorum eğer bir şey yapsaydım ya ben ya da terapistim çözerdi her ne kadar kafası karışık olsa da"
"My (23F) dad (48M) sexualizes me on a regular basis. It started happening around the time I hit puberty. Growing up I didn’t have a lot of friends so I didn’t even realize this wasn’t normal. He would pretend like he was going to give me a French kiss with his mouth wide open and his tongue out and even mentioned that I should start wearing a bra.

As I got older it turned into him jokingly asking to see my boobs and making masturbation jokes. I would ask him to help me with something and he would reply “if you let me see your boobs.” He still does this to this day. When he hugs me sometimes he reaches down and “jokingly” grabs my butt. He has even gone as far as to fake hump me.

When I was 17 my parents bought a vacation home in another country and started living there half the time. It made things harder and easier at the same time. But then my dad started putting cameras up all around the house. There was even one pointed at my bedroom door. He would joke around about hiding a camera in my shower or my bedroom, to the point sometimes I would worry there was actually a camera in my room.
I moved out a year and a half ago and things are slightly better because I don’t go over to their house super often. When I visit with my fiancé my dad doesn’t make any jokes or put any hands on me, it’s only when I’m over there by myself.

I’ve told him to stop and that I don’t like it but he just laughs and says it was a joke. It bothers me to no end and I’ve even started having dreams that my dad sexually assaults me. My mom doesn’t do anything about it and has never said anything about it. He does similar stuff to my older sister but I definitely get the worst of it.

How do I handle the situation? I feel guilty for letting it go on as long as it has.","babam beni düzenli olarak cinselleştiriyor, ergenliğe girdiğim sıralarda olmaya başladı, büyürken çok fazla arkadaşım yoktu, bu yüzden bunun normal olmadığını bile fark etmemiştim, ağzı açık ve dili dışarıda bana Fransız öpücüğü verecekmiş gibi yapardı ve hatta sütyen takmam gerektiğini söylerdi

yaşlandıkça şaka yollu göğüslerimi görmek istemeye ve mastürbasyon şakaları yapmaya başladı, ondan bir konuda bana yardım etmesini isterdim ve bana göğüslerini göstermeme izin verirsen diye cevap verirdi, bunu bugün bile yapıyor, bana sarıldığında bazen aşağı uzanıp şaka yollu popomu kavrar, hatta beni sahte bir şekilde becerecek kadar ileri gitti

ben ailem başka bir ülkede tatil evi satın aldığında ve orada yaşamaya başladığımda, işler aynı anda hem daha zor hem de daha kolay hale geldi, ama sonra babam evin her yerine kameralar koymaya başladı, hatta bir tanesi yatak odası kapımı bile gösteriyordu, duşuma veya yatak odama bir kamera saklamakla ilgili şakalar yapardı, bazen odamda gerçekten bir kamera olduğundan endişe ederdim
taşındım bir buçuk yıl önce ayrıldım ve işler biraz daha iyi çünkü nişanlımla ziyarete gittiğimde evlerine çok sık gitmiyorum babam şaka yapmıyor veya bana el kaldırmıyor sadece tek başıma orada olduğumda

ona durmasını ve bundan hoşlanmadığımı söyledim ama o sadece gülüyor ve bunun bir şaka olduğunu söylüyor bu beni çok rahatsız ediyor ve hatta babamın bana cinsel saldırıda bulunduğu rüyalar görmeye başladım annem bu konuda hiçbir şey yapmıyor ve hiç bir zaman da söylemedi ablamla da benzer şeyler yapıyor ama kesinlikle en kötüsünü ben yaşıyorum

durumu nasıl idare ediyorum devam etmesine izin verdiğim için suçluluk duyuyorum bu kadar uzun"
"I've (M) never been attracted to men, not in the slightest. I've even gotten screwed by a man, and it was so horrific that I never want it to happen again. but due to a deep rooted childhood fetish stemming from unrestricted internet access, every time I watch porn of that nature i get involuntarily hard. (Note; i did this to see if it would work, not to get relief to) And when i watch porn of women, i have to struggle to get anything. i have no idea how to stop this from happening. i can't get hard for women, despite my massive attraction to stuff like boobs and ass. do i need to keep trying or something? i know that later in life this is going to effect me greatly, and if i can't get a hold of it now, what are the chances i get ahold of it in the future? Plus, my gf is a hard Christian, she discovers that i can only get hard to men and it's over. please help, I hate this so much.

"At 12:30 am today my gf and I woke up to my upstairs neighbors having sex. At first I was like, okay, annoying, but then I couldn't fall back asleep because of how off it sounded. It almost sounded like she was crying and at one point I heard her saying ""baby stop"" (in kind of an urgent manner) but then shortly after that she'd be like moaning as expected I guess, or enjoying it. But then it like kept going back and forth between her sobbing crying (from our interpretation of what we heard) and it sounding non-consensual to her seemingly okay and participating (even though my girlfriend said that she wasn't buying that her good moans were authentic). We laid there for an hour sick to our stomachs contemplating what to do. At one point he was choking her and then slapping her. All could be very normal things, but it was making us sick to our stomachs because of how not mutual it sounded at points.

We don't even know what the people above us look like much less their names. Our building is still relatively small though and we didn't want to make a huge scene by calling the police at 1 am and rlly they're just in to bdsm. We considered going to knock on the door and asking them to be quiet to just be nosey, but ultimately decided that wasn't safe. So after a while it seemed to stop, so we fell back asleep. But my girlfriend woke up around 5.... and it was happening again.

To my best understanding as a bisexual woman, it is not possible for a woman to have THAT aggressive of sex for THAT many hours and it be enjoyable. That made me feel so terrible about our decision to not call at 1. We called the non emergency police line this morning and requested a welfare check on the woman. They showed up an hour later... knocked... no answer.. left. I've literally been sick to my stomach all day thinking about this woman but I truly don't know what to do at this point.","bugün sabah saat 12'de kız arkadaşım ve ben üst kattaki komşularımızın seks yaptığını duyarak uyandık, ilk başta tamam sinir bozucu dedim ama sonra sesi çok garip geldiği için tekrar uyuyamadım, neredeyse ağlıyormuş gibi geliyordu ve bir noktada acil bir şekilde bebeğim dur dediğini duydum ama kısa bir süre sonra tahmin ettiğim gibi inlemeye başladı ya da bundan zevk aldı ama sonra duyduğumuz şeyin bizim yorumumuza göre hıçkırarak ağlaması ve onun için rızası dışında gelmesi arasında gidip gelmeye devam etti, kız arkadaşım iyi inlemelerinin gerçek olduğuna inanmadığını söylese de bir saat boyunca midemiz bulanarak orada yattık, ne yapacağımızı düşündük, bir noktada onu boğuyordu ve sonra tokatlıyordu, hepsi çok normal şeyler olabilirdi ama bazen karşılıklı olmadığı için midemiz bulanıyordu

üstümüzdeki insanların neye benzediğini bile bilmiyoruz, isimlerini hiç bilmiyoruz ama binamız hala nispeten küçük ve sabah ve gerçekten polisi arayarak büyük bir olay çıkarmak istemedik onlar sadece bdsm'e meraklılar kapıyı çalıp onlara sadece meraklı olmak için sessiz olmalarını söylemeyi düşündük ama sonunda bunun güvenli olmadığına karar verdik bu yüzden bir süre sonra durdu gibi göründü bu yüzden tekrar uykuya daldık ama kız arkadaşım uyandı ve tekrar olmaya başladı

"to make a long story short my bf broke his phone yesterday. I work in IT so he had me set up his new one. He hasn’t backed up his icloud in forever so it started restoring some old pics and vids. there was a sex tape of him fucking a girl from behind, in february 2020. we started dating in Dec 2020- so it didn’t register at first that it couldn’t have been me. The video looked very very very similar to me, we both have the same hair color, body type, no identifiable  tattoos from the angle of the video- so i watched almost the entire thing until i turned the sound and heard a woman who was not me :( 

i know my boyfriend has not watched this video in ages and didnt know it still existed in his icloud. we have a healthy relationship in regards to fidelity and trust and i have had open access to his phone our entire relationship- never found anything. this is just an extremely unfortunate circumstance but it feels so traumatic, it keeps replaying in my head, i keep thinking about how the way he fucked her looked exactly like how he fucks me, i can’t help but have insecure thoughts :( 

i also want to point out some stuff i can get over but is making this harder 

-he talks about this girl in a way that made it seem they stopped having sex long before that video. he said the last year of their relationship he barely could have sex with her bc of how toxic and terrible it had gotten he even started exploring bisexuality bc he thought he was gay when he ‘couldnt get hard for her’. then i see this video of him fucking her happy as hell 10 months before we get into a relationship. it just fuckin sucks. 

i understand the nuance to this. i want to move past it. my boyfriend is a great partner, he will be a great husband and father, i know he loves me, but i can’t help but feel heartbroken and sick to my stomach. i want to forget the image out of my head. please help me find a way to get over this and to forget the image as it is actually haunting me. i threw up this morning from discomfort and heartbreak. 

he knows i saw it. he deleted it immediately. he’s heartbroken that i saw it. he doesn’t even want to talk about it tho bc it was an accident and he hates that it happened but i feel like i just need to keep fucking talking about it i don’t even know I CANT GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD PLEASE HELP 

tldr- bfs icloud backup restored an old video of him having sex with an ex from the back that looked exactly like me so i watched the entire thing multiple times until i turned the sound on and realized it was a different woman from before we started dating. it’s burned into my brain and i can’t stop feeling sick

UPDATE: i sat by the lake all day yesterday and wrote the most depressing shit on rocks and threw them into the lake to drown (thank u for the suggestions). my bf ended up checking my location and meeting me there after work. we sat by the lake and talked about everything, he clarified any concerns i was having, and i feel a lot better. it fuckin sucks for sure but i will get over it. i think i really needed re assurance from him and with time our good memories will hopefully tape over this one. thank you for everyone’s kind words. 🖤","uzun lafın kısası erkek arkadaşım dün telefonunu kırdı ben de onda çalışıyorum bu yüzden bana yenisini kurdurdu icloud'unu sonsuza dek yedeklememiş bu yüzden eski resimleri ve videoları geri yüklemeye başladı şubat ayında bir kızı arkadan becerdiği bir seks kaseti vardı aralık ayında çıkmaya başladık bu yüzden ilk başta bunun ben olamayacağımı fark etmedim video bana çok çok çok benziyordu ikimizin de saç rengi vücut tipi aynı videonun açısından bakıldığında ayırt edilebilir dövmelerimiz yok bu yüzden neredeyse tamamını izledim ta ki sesi açıp benden farklı bir kadın duyana kadar

erkek arkadaşımın bu videoyu uzun zamandır izlemediğini ve icloud'unda hala var olduğunu bilmediğini biliyorum sadakat ve güven açısından sağlıklı bir ilişkimiz var ve telefonuna açık erişimim vardı tüm ilişkimizde hiçbir şey bulamadık bu sadece son derece talihsiz bir durum ama çok travmatik hissettiriyor kafamda tekrar tekrar oynuyor onu becerme şeklinin beni becerme şekline tıpatıp benzediğini düşünüp duruyorum elimde değil güvensiz düşünceler

Ayrıca üstesinden gelebileceğim ama bunu daha da zorlaştıran bazı şeylere de işaret etmek istiyorum

Bu kızdan, videodan çok önce seks yapmayı bırakmış gibi görünen bir şekilde bahsediyor, ilişkilerinin son yılında onunla neredeyse hiç seks yapamadığını çünkü ne kadar toksik ve korkunç hale geldiğini söyledi, hatta biseksüelliği keşfetmeye bile başladı çünkü onun için sertleşemediğinde eşcinsel olduğunu düşünüyordu, sonra onun bu videosunu gördüm, ilişkiye girmeden aylar önce cehennem gibi mutlu bir şekilde onu beceriyor, bu çok kötü

Bunun nüansını anlıyorum, bunu aşmak istiyorum, erkek arkadaşım harika bir partner, harika bir koca ve baba olacak, beni sevdiğini biliyorum ama kalbimin kırıldığını ve midemin bulandığını hissetmekten kendimi alamıyorum, lütfen bunun üstesinden gelmenin ve beni gerçekten rahatsız eden görüntüyü unutmanın bir yolunu bulmama yardım edin, bu sabah rahatsızlıktan ve kalp kırıklığından kustum

Gördüğümü biliyor, hemen sildi, gördüğüm için kalbi kırıldı, ama bunun hakkında konuşmak bile istemiyor çünkü kazaydı ve bunun olmasından nefret ediyor ama bunun hakkında konuşmaya devam etmem gerektiğini hissediyorum, hatta bilmiyorum bile, kafamdan çıkaramıyorum lütfen yardım edin

tldr bfs icloud yedeklemesi, tıpkı bana benzeyen eski bir eski sevgilisiyle seks yaptığı eski bir videoyu geri yükledi, bu yüzden sesi açıp çıkmaya başlamadan önceki kadından farklı olduğunu fark edene kadar her şeyi birkaç kez izledim, beynime kazındı ve kendimi hasta hissetmekten alamıyorum

güncelleme dün bütün gün göl kenarında oturdum ve kayalara en depresif şeyleri yazdım ve boğulmak için onları göle attım önerilerin için teşekkür ederim erkek arkadaşım sonunda bulunduğum yeri kontrol etti ve işten sonra orada benimle buluştu göl kenarında oturduk ve her şey hakkında konuştuk, sahip olduğum endişeleri açıkladı ve kendimi çok daha iyi hissediyorum, kesinlikle berbat ama bunun üstesinden geleceğim sanırım ondan gerçekten bir güvenceye ihtiyacım vardı ve zamanla umarım güzel anılarımız bunu örtbas eder herkesin nazik sözleri için teşekkür ederim"
"
My heart is breaking for her. I dont even think ive processed it because while she has cried her eyes out to me irl and otp and ive consoled her without crying some part of me feels like what shes saying is untrue. Idk

As the title says what hurts her the most is her bf of 2yrs whom she lived with and planned to get married to left her after he found out. They had a normal happy loving relationship. But after he found out he packed his stuff and left and told her he cant do this. 

She has always put her bf first. She loves him so much. Always made him food, ironed his clothes etc made sure he was set and ready to go. 

Her parents live abroad so shes here all alone. Shes gonna work until march to go back to her home country. She told me if she goes back to her home country likely her dad wont let her come back here which means i probably wont ever see her again. Idk what to do for her im so sad. 

","kalbim onun için kırılıyor, bunu anlayabildiğimi bile sanmıyorum çünkü bana gerçek hayatta ve otp'de gözlerinden yaşlar boşanırken ve ben onu ağlamadan teselli ederken, bir parçam onun söylediklerinin doğru olmadığını hissediyor, bilmiyorum

başlığın da dediği gibi onu en çok üzen şey, birlikte yaşadığı ve evlenmeyi planladığı yılların erkek arkadaşının, normal, mutlu ve sevgi dolu bir ilişkileri olduğunu öğrendikten sonra onu terk etmesi ama öğrendikten sonra eşyalarını toplayıp gitmesi ve ona bunu yapamayacağını söylemesi

erkek arkadaşını her zaman ilk sıraya koymuş, onu çok seviyor, ona her zaman yemek yapmış, kıyafetlerini ütülemiş vs. onun hazır olduğundan ve gitmeye hazır olduğundan emin olmuş

anne ve babası yurtdışında yaşıyor, bu yüzden burada tek başına, memleketine dönmek için mart ayına kadar çalışacak, bana memleketine dönerse babasının muhtemelen geri dönmesine izin vermeyeceğini söyledi, bu da onu bir daha asla göremeyeceğim anlamına geliyor, onun için ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, çok üzgünüm"
"25M here. I met a girl (let’s call her Riley, 23F) at my university. When the semester began this year I noticed that during orientation she kept looking at me and I took that as her thinking something about me. Maybe she thought I was ugly or cute idk. Riley and I both ended up taking a class together and I noticed again that she would look to my direction frequently throughout the semester. Another classmate (I also ended up being friends with) also noticed this and told me that “she’s totally into me”.  Towards the end of the semester Riley and I were put into a group for some class project. I thought it was a good time to strike conversation without coming off weird since I had the excuse that we were in a group together. We spoke but she did not reciprocate most of the time. 

As days past we occasionally struck up conversation but I noticed that I was the only one carrying the conversation. I still very much thought she was attractive and never made a move until today. I can’t sleep due to the cringe. 

For context, I’ve been getting my feet wet in bodybuilding since April now and my first minor community competition is going to be next week. It’s nothing extravagant. Just a little “beginner” show for those who are interested in bodybuilding. After our last class (which was yesterday). As she was leaving the building, right outside I flagged her down. I went up to her and said it was nice working with her this semester yadda yadda yadda. I then invited her to see me “compete” in said competition. Here’s the cringy exchange of conversation from what I can remember:

Me: “hey by the way, I’m actually competing in a beginner BB competition next week and wanted to invite you. Afterwards we can get food as I’ve been dieting these past few months.

Riley: “uh for what”? 

Me: *f*ck panicking* “ it’s for bodybuilding, it’s not a big competition it’s just a beginner event hosted by members of the community. 

Riley: “Oh that sounds kind of weird. Is it only men?”

Me: “yeah the competition is for men” but family and friends and welcome to cheer whoever they support on stage when it’s their turn”

Riley: “wait we’re friends?”

Me: “well yeah I consider you a friend” 

Riley: “OP no offense but I barely know you and don’t you think it’s weird you’re inviting a girl to an all men competition?” 

At this point I was so uncomfortable as I saw the eyes of other people looking at us while having this exchange of conversation. When she said that, my heart literally sunk and I felt like I was going to faint. Thinking about it right now makes me kinda choke up lol.

Me: “uhhh, yeah I understand. no worries. Never mind, haha. Have a good Christmas break yeah?”

At this point I noticed Riley looked a bit uncomfortable herself. And I turned around 180 and just walked away feeling so stupid for what just happened. I looked over my shoulder and noticed Riley was still standing there probably feeling the same? I don’t know. 

I don’t know what to do. Maybe I did come off a little creepy? She has a point I didn’t even have her number and here I was inviting her to see me half naked in a BB beginner competition. FML I feel so damn stupid for even thinking that was a good idea. Considering our major has a pretty small class size, I’m almost certain I’m going to see her next semester.","burada üniversitemde bir kızla tanıştım, ona riley f diyelim, bu yıl dönem başladığında oryantasyon sırasında bana bakmaya devam ettiğini fark ettim ve bunu benim hakkımda bir şeyler düşündüğü şeklinde yorumladım, belki beni çirkin veya sevimli bulmuştur, bilmiyorum riley ve ben birlikte bir derse gittik ve tekrar fark ettim ki dönem boyunca sık sık bana bakıyordu, arkadaş olduğum başka bir sınıf arkadaşım da bunu fark etti ve bana tamamen benden hoşlandığını söyledi, dönemin sonuna doğru riley ve ben bir sınıf projesi için bir gruba konulduk, garip görünmeden sohbete başlamak için iyi bir zaman olduğunu düşündüm, çünkü birlikte bir grupta olduğumuz bahanesi vardı, konuştuk ama çoğu zaman karşılık vermedi

günler geçtikçe ara sıra sohbete başladık ama sohbeti sürdüren tek kişinin ben olduğumu fark ettim, hala onu çok çekici buluyordum ve bugüne kadar hiç hareket etmedi, utançtan uyuyamıyorum

bağlam için nisan ayından beri vücut geliştirmeyle uğraşıyorum ve ilk küçük topluluk yarışmam önümüzdeki hafta olacak, hiçbir şey değil abartılı sadece vücut geliştirmeyle ilgilenenler için küçük bir başlangıç ​​gösterisi dün son dersten sonra binadan hemen dışarıda ayrılırken onu durdurdum yanına gittim ve bu dönem onunla çalışmanın güzel olduğunu söyledim filan filan filan sonra onu söz konusu yarışmada yarışmamı izlemeye davet ettim hatırlayabildiğim kadarıyla iğrenç bir konuşma alışverişi şöyle

bu arada ben aslında gelecek hafta bir başlangıç ​​bb yarışmasında yarışıyorum ve sonrasında seni davet etmek istedim son birkaç aydır diyet yaptığım için yemek yiyebiliriz

riley uh ne için

ben fck panikledim vücut geliştirme için büyük bir yarışma değil sadece topluluk üyeleri tarafından düzenlenen bir başlangıç ​​etkinliği

riley oh bu biraz garip geliyor sadece erkekler mi

ben evet yarışma erkekler için ama aile ve arkadaşlar ve sahnede destekledikleri herkesi sıraları geldiğinde desteklemeye davetliler

riley bekle biz arkadaşız

ben evet seni bir arkadaşım olarak görüyorum

riley op kusura bakma ama seni zar zor tanıyorum ve sence de garip değil mi bir kızı sadece erkeklerden oluşan bir yarışmaya davet ediyorsun

bu noktada diğer insanların gözlerinin bize baktığını gördüğümde çok rahatsız oldum, o bunu söylediğinde kalbim kelimenin tam anlamıyla çöktü ve bayılacak gibi hissettim, şu anda bunu düşünmek beni biraz boğazım düğümleniyor lol

ben uhhh evet anlıyorum, endişelenmene gerek yok, haha ​​iyi noel tatilleri geçir evet

bu noktada riley'nin biraz rahatsız göründüğünü fark ettim ve arkamı dönüp az önce olanlar için kendimi çok aptal hissederek uzaklaştım, omzumun üzerinden baktım ve riley'nin hala orada durduğunu fark ettim, muhtemelen aynı şekilde hissediyordu, bilmiyorum

ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, belki biraz ürkütücü göründüm, haklıydı, numarası bile yoktu ve burada onu yarı çıplak bir şekilde bir bb başlangıç ​​yarışmasında beni görmeye davet ediyordum, fml, bunun iyi bir fikir olduğunu düşündüğüm için kendimi çok aptal hissediyorum, ana dalımızın oldukça küçük bir sınıf mevcudu var, onu önümüzdeki dönem göreceğimden neredeyse eminim"
"Pretty much what the title says, I was with this really hot girl and had her already pretty turned on, kissed her neck, her lips, touched her a little and rubbed against her for a lot of time. As soon as she said put on your condom and put it inside, I really don’t know what happened, but my rock hard erection went away pretty quick. I have to say that I’m still a virgin, and that that was my “first time” which really doesn’t count cuz I couldn’t put it in. 

I really don’t know how to feel or who to talk to, I’m still in shock and in utter disbelief, even more due to it being my first time. I just went to put on the condom and it went away, even though we were already in the bed for a good 20 minutes (rock hard), I really don’t know what to do rn. She was very supportive and her reaction really impressed me a lot, she said it did not matter and that it happens more often than I think, but still, I can’t believe what happened tonight. What should I do? Should I see a doctor? Any advice and questions are welcome. 😞","başlıkta yazdığı gibi gerçekten çok ateşli bir kızla birlikteydim ve onu çoktan tahrik etmiştim boynunu öptüm dudakları ona hafifçe dokundu ve uzun süre ona sürtündü prezervatifini tak ve içine koy dediğinde ne olduğunu gerçekten bilmiyorum ama kaya gibi sert ereksiyonum oldukça hızlı geçti hala bakire olduğumu ve bunun ilk seferim olduğunu söylemeliyim ki bu gerçekten önemli değil çünkü takamadım

nasıl hissedeceğimi veya kiminle konuşacağımı gerçekten bilmiyorum hala şoktayım ve inanılmaz bir durumdayım ilk seferim olduğu için daha da fazla prezervatifi takmaya gittim ve geçti zaten yatakta dakikalarca olmamıza rağmen kaya gibi sert ne yapacağımı gerçekten bilmiyorum şu an çok destekleyiciydi ve tepkisi beni gerçekten çok etkiledi bunun önemli olmadığını ve düşündüğümden daha sık olduğunu söyledi ama yine de bu gece olanlara inanamıyorum ne yapmalıyım bir doktora görünmeli miyim her türlü tavsiye ve soruya açığım"
"So yesterday I surprised my girlfriend with breakfast in bed. When I was done, I knew not to pour the grease from the bacon down the sink, so I thought I would be fine pouring it on the back porch (I thought it would be bad for the grass). Well I now realize how stupid that was because, as I'm sure you all can guess, it hardened and has left a gooey, slippery spot. My girlfriend saw it last night as we took the trash to the curb and was like ""be careful, there's ice"" (it was dark out) and I was like ""haha, yeah. That's totally ice.""

How do I clean this up before we get hurt (or worse, she finds out i poured bacon grease on a walking surface)? I've tried baking soda to absorb it to no avail. Water cleared a spot in the puddle, but still not much.","dün kız arkadaşımı yatakta kahvaltıyla şaşırttım işim bittiğinde pastırmadan gelen yağı lavaboya dökmemem gerektiğini biliyordum bu yüzden arka verandaya dökmenin sorun olmayacağını düşündüm çimler için kötü olacağını düşündüm şimdi bunun ne kadar aptalca olduğunu anlıyorum çünkü hepinizin tahmin edebileceği gibi sertleşti ve yapış yapış kaygan bir leke bıraktı kız arkadaşım dün gece çöpü kaldırıma götürürken gördü ve dikkatli ol buz var dedi dışarısı karanlıktı ve ben de haha ​​evet bu tamamen buz dedim

So I wanted to ask if I can do something for her not to spy on me and watch everything I'm doing?  
(I'm not accepting answers like: ""Just talk to her"" or ""call 911"")

edit: I just want to let you guys know that what I meant by ""calling 911 isn't a solution for me"" is that I meant that I don't want to call the police on my own parents or any other authorities, because that just seems too wrong for me.","annem ve babam yakın zamanda odama bir kamera yerleştirdi ve o zamandan beri kesinlikle hiç mahremiyetim kalmadı bu yüzden dün bu saçmalığa daha fazla dayanamayacağıma karar verdim ve kameranın fişini çektim ama sonra annem bana bağırmaya başladı ve kamerayı tekrar takmamı ve böyle bırakmamı söyledi bu yüzden ona beni gözetlememesini ve yaptığım her şeyi izlememesini sağlamak için bir şey yapıp yapamayacağımı sormak istedim
sadece onunla konuş veya ara gibi cevapları kabul etmiyorum

"I’ll try to keep this simple. About 10 years ago, I left my hometown after being caught in an embarrassing situation. Word spread quickly, and I became the target of constant ridicule. I went from having a healthy group of friends to being laughed at wherever I went. I realized that what I did would follow me forever, so I packed my bags and moved a few states away, where no one knew me.

Since then, I’ve rebuilt my life. I landed a great job, made some amazing friends, and even got invited to social circles that I’d never have had access to before. My boss, who owns the company, eventually introduced me to one of his daughters. After dating for a few years, we got engaged and are planning to get married next year.

Despite being very close to both my fiancée and her father, I’ve always avoided talking about my past or my family. It’s come up a few times with her dad, and I’ve told him that I left my hometown because of something embarrassing I did, but I made it clear that it wasn’t illegal or harmful to anyone. I told him I was bullied for it, and that’s why I left. He understood and never brought it up again.

However, my fiancée really wants to meet my family. She can’t fathom how anyone could see me as anything other than the person she loves, but I know my family and my old friends, and I’m afraid if the past comes up, it’ll change her view of me completely. This has caused some tension between us, and we’ve had a few fights over it.

I’ve been thinking about reaching out to my parents and telling them about my life and future plans, but after not speaking for the last decade, I’m worried it could end badly and damage the positive image my fiancée has of me.

What do you think I should do?

Edit : The embarrassing thing I did was getting caught peeling in a sink … like the sink where you wash your hands …

Edit 2 : I have been overwhelmed by the amount of kindness and support so many of you have offered, here is an update, I told my Fiancée the following, I left my hometown because of bullying and harassment, my parents showed no support and were very close minded to my calls for help which is why I left, they didn’t care to communicate with me since. I told her that I’ll send them a message and keep the door open. I messaged my parents and it didn’t go well. My father mocked me, I guess he’s still upset and even mentioned that he’d rather I ‘stay out of dodge’. I told my fiancée that I wouldn’t take further steps to bridge gaps there. She understood. 

Edit 3 : My father said he’d like to know where I live to ‘forward’ some mail, I have no socials so there’s no way he’d be able to find me but I told him that I’d pay to have the mail scanned at a Staples, he told me to ‘forget about it’ and then asked me if I still ‘piss on the floor’ so yeah that was fun ","Bunu basit tutmaya çalışacağım yıllar önce utanç verici bir duruma yakalandıktan sonra memleketimi terk ettim haber hızla yayıldı ve sürekli alay konusu oldum sağlıklı bir arkadaş grubundan gittiğim her yerde alay konusu olmaya geçtim yaptığım şeyin beni sonsuza dek takip edeceğini fark ettim bu yüzden çantamı topladım ve kimsenin beni tanımadığı birkaç eyalete taşındım

o zamandan beri hayatımı yeniden kurdum harika bir işe girdim harika arkadaşlar edindim ve hatta daha önce hiç erişemediğim sosyal çevrelere davet edildim şirketin sahibi olan patronum sonunda beni kızlarından biriyle tanıştırdı birkaç yıl flört ettikten sonra nişanlandık ve gelecek yıl evlenmeyi planlıyoruz

hem nişanlımla hem de babasıyla çok yakın olmamıza rağmen geçmişim veya ailem hakkında konuşmaktan her zaman kaçındım babasıyla birkaç kez konuştuk ve ona memleketimi yaptığım utanç verici bir şey yüzünden terk ettiğimi söyledim ama bunun yasadışı veya kimseye zararlı olmadığını açıkça belirttim ona bunun yüzünden zorbalığa uğradığımı ve bu yüzden ayrıldığımı söyledim o da anladı ve asla bunu kabul etmedi tekrar yukarı

ancak nişanlım gerçekten ailemle tanışmak istiyor, herhangi birinin beni sevdiği kişiden başka bir şey olarak nasıl görebildiğini anlayamıyor ama ailemi ve eski arkadaşlarımı tanıyorum ve geçmiş ortaya çıkarsa bana bakış açısını tamamen değiştireceğinden korkuyorum bu aramızda biraz gerginliğe neden oldu ve bu yüzden birkaç kez kavga ettik

ebeveynlerime ulaşmayı ve onlara hayatımı ve gelecek planlarımı anlatmayı düşünüyordum ama son on yıldır konuşmadıktan sonra bunun kötü sonuçlanabileceğinden ve nişanlımın benim hakkımdaki olumlu imajını zedeleyebileceğinden endişeleniyorum

ne yapmam gerektiğini düşünüyorsun

düzenle yaptığım utanç verici şey, ellerinizi yıkadığınız lavabo gibi bir lavaboda soyulurken yakalanmaktı

düzenle birçoğunuzun sunduğu nezaket ve destek miktarı karşısında şaşkına döndüm, işte bir güncelleme nişanlıma şunları söyledim, zorbalık ve taciz yüzünden memleketimi terk ettim, ebeveynlerim hiçbir destek göstermedi ve yardım çağrılarıma çok dar görüşlüydü, bu yüzden ayrıldım, ona onlara bir mesaj göndereceğimi söylediğimden beri benimle iletişim kurmakla ilgilenmediler mesaj at ve kapıyı açık tut anne ve babama mesaj attım ve iyi gitmedi babam benimle alay etti sanırım hala üzgündü ve hatta benim ortalıkta görünmememi tercih ettiğini söyledi nişanlıma oradaki boşlukları kapatmak için daha fazla adım atmayacağımı söyledim o da anladı

düzenle babam yaşadığım yeri bilmek istediğini söyledi bazı postaları iletmek için sosyal medya hesabım yok bu yüzden beni bulması imkansız ama ona postayı Staples'ta taratmak için para ödeyeceğimi söyledim bana bunu unutmamı söyledi ve sonra hala yere işeyip işemediğimi sordu yani evet eğlenceliydi"

Me and my mate went out drinking yesterday. Idk if it matters but im 17 and he is 16. Anyways. After we had a bit to drink he was hammered. I was fairly drunk too but not as drunk as him. He asking if he could s my p. He said he just wanted to try. He took my pants down by force and kept nagging. Said he just was curious. He asked if I could s his p. I kept saying no. After a bit he had cornered me and took out his p. He kinda pushed me down and made my face touch his p several times. I was REALLY unconfortable. I didn't want to make the situation get out of hand so I laughed it of as i slowly got up. He was so drunk so i'm not sure he remembers. But I do. It makes me really unconfortable and I get sick, disgusted and ashamed when I think about it. I hate it. I try to be really tough all the time and i'm a fairy masculine man.

"Exactly what the title says. My wife and I skew left, and her parents are MAGA folks. They don’t go to rallies or have a million signs, but they are big Trump supporters. 

From 2015-2018 there were lots of “debates” and arguments that caused some issues between my in-laws and our household. At some point we all kind of agreed discussing politics was just not on the table for us. We managed to navigate the pandemic and 2020 election and ensuing years without any problems. 

In leading up to this election, there’s been mostly radio silence but about 3 weeks ago over some wine and conversation my MIL asked us, “Are you really going to vote for her?” It was asked respectfully, and when we both told her yes, she was visibly disappointed but we all moved on quickly.

My children were home from school today, but I worked and my wife had appointments, so my MIL watched our children for a stretch today.

I received my mail-in ballot on Friday evening, and I left it in our bills/mail holder over the weekend as a reminder to take care of it.

It is now missing. 

I saw it yesterday morning. I have ripped the house apart since 3:30, and it is gone. We live in a swing state, so our votes “really matter.” 

We are also very organized and do not misplace things generally. My wife only votes in-person. I asked her if she has seen it, but she has not.

I haven’t mentioned my suspicions to my wife, but I am very concerned that my MIL either destroyed my ballot or even worse, decided to take it upon herself to cast a vote for the other guy.

While I know this would be illegal, I have no interest in the authorities. My wife’s mother is extremely sensitive and would take even inquiring about it as an accusation.

We’ve worked really hard to get in a good place, and I really don’t want to mess it up, but I obviously need to figure out what went down.

What should I do?

"
Hello! This is very unusual for me to be writing here but I feel I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

My (26 nb) older sister (31 f) is wanting to have a baby with her husband (30 m) but they have been having fertility issues. I feel for her since I have one kid of my own with my partner (26 m) and can’t imagine my life without him. I told my sister I would be here for her through this hard time and we have been spending lots of time together, me, her and my son, to help her through complicated emotions and difficult circumstances. We have been discussing options for her and BIL like adoption, artificial insemination, and surrogacy. She said none seemed ideal to her but she would talk to her husband about the options and see what he thought. About a week later my sister comes over for a scheduled hang out but seems much more nervous then usual. She asks if we can sit and chat about something and i say of course let me set ned (my son) up with his show and we can chat in the kitchen. She tells me her and BIL(bill) talked about options and he seemed interested in surrogacy, reason being it would be his own sperm. I said that I was glad and she continued, she said bill had suggested ME as their surrogate. I was a bit surprised and had told her I need to think about it. She left and I was feeling stressed. After talking with my partner about my feeling on the matter I decided to decline being my sisters surrogate and not tell her why. I met up with my sister and told her I was not going to be her surrogate. She was visibly disappointed by this and sat with the info for a minute. She eventually asked why I declined and I basically avoided the question. She asked again maybe thinking I hadn’t heard her the first time, I don’t know, but I told her I just didn’t want to. She wasn’t satisfied with this and pushed me harder to “give her a good reason why not”. I was offended by this and told her I didn’t need a good reason. She said her and bill were really hoping and looking forward to me being their surrogate and I was letting them both down. I told her to please leave and she stormed out. 

Here’s the thing, I was born afab but identify as nonbinary, I didn’t tell my sister why I wouldn’t surrogate because I can’t have kids anymore. About 3 years ago I began my journey of phalloplasty surgery. None of my family know however, they know I’m nonbinary. I had decided not to tell my family about my surgeries because, honestly, it’s none of their business. During my surgery/ recovery time my partner and I had said we were going on vacation to Asia. And none of them are any the wiser. 

Over the past few days my sister, bill, and my parents have been blowing up my phone telling me I am being completely unreasonable and to at least give them a reason why I will not. I don’t think I need to give them a reason even if I was able to have kids but maybe I should just tell them all the truth to keep the peace.

I would love to know all your advice. ","merhaba, buraya yazmam benim için çok alışılmadık bir durum ama kendimi zor bir durumda hissediyorum

ablam f, kocası m ile bir bebek sahibi olmak istiyor ama doğurganlık sorunları yaşıyorlar, ben de partnerim m ile bir çocuğum olduğu için ona acıyorum ve onsuz hayatımı hayal edemiyorum, kız kardeşime bu zor zamanlarında yanında olacağımı söyledim ve karmaşık duygular ve zor koşullar altında ona yardımcı olmak için birlikte çok zaman geçirdik, kendisi ve oğlumla birlikte evlat edinme, yapay tohumlama ve taşıyıcı annelik gibi seçenekleri tartıştık, hiçbiri ona ideal görünmedi ama kocasıyla seçenekler hakkında konuşup ne düşündüğünü görmek istediğini söyledi, bir hafta sonra kız kardeşim planlanmış bir takılma için geldi ama her zamankinden çok daha gergin görünüyor, oturup bir şey hakkında sohbet edebilir miyiz diye sordu ve ben de tabii ki oğlumu şovuna ayarlamama izin ver, mutfakta sohbet edebiliriz, dedi, bana kendisi ve bilbill'in seçeneklerden bahsettiğini ve taşıyıcı annelikle ilgilendiğini söyledi, bunun sebebi kendi spermi olmasıydı, buna sevindiğimi söyledim ve devam etti Bill'in beni taşıyıcı anne olarak önerdiğini söyledi, biraz şaşırdım ve ona bunun hakkında düşünmem gerektiğini söyledim, o gitti ve partnerimle bu konudaki hislerimi konuştuktan sonra strese girdim, kız kardeşimin taşıyıcı annesi olmayı reddetmeye ve kız kardeşimle neden buluştuğumu ve ona taşıyıcı annesi olmayacağımı söylememeye karar verdim, bu durumdan açıkça hayal kırıklığına uğradı ve bir dakika boyunca bilgiyle oturdu, sonunda neden reddettiğimi sordu ve temelde tekrar sorduğu soruyu görmezden geldim, belki de ilk seferde onu duymadığımı düşünüyordum, bilmiyorum ama ona sadece istemediğimi söyledim, bundan memnun değildi ve ona neden olmaması gerektiğini söylemem için beni daha çok zorladı, bundan rahatsız oldum ve ona iyi bir nedene ihtiyacım olmadığını söyledim, kendisinin ve Bill'in taşıyıcı anne olmamı gerçekten umduğunu ve dört gözle beklediğini ve ikisini de hayal kırıklığına uğrattığımı söyledi, ona lütfen gitmesini söyledim ve o da öfkeyle gitti

İşte mesele şu ki ben afab olarak doğdum ama kendimi ikili olmayan biri olarak tanımlıyorum, kız kardeşime neden taşıyıcı anne olmak istemediğimi söylemedim çünkü artık çocuk sahibi olamayacağım, yaklaşık yıllar önce falloplasti ameliyatı yolculuğuma başladım ailemden hiçbiri bilmiyor ancak ikili cinsiyetli olmadığımı biliyorlar aileme ameliyatlarımdan bahsetmemeye karar verdim çünkü dürüst olmak gerekirse bu onları ilgilendirmez ameliyat sonrası iyileşme sürecimde partnerimle Asya'ya tatile gideceğimizi söylemiştik ve hiçbiri bir şey anlamadı

son birkaç gündür kız kardeşim bill ve annem babam telefonumu patlatıp bana tamamen mantıksız davrandığımı ve en azından neden yapmayacağımı söylememi söylüyorlar çocuk sahibi olabilsem bile onlara bir sebep göstermem gerektiğini düşünmüyorum ama belki de barışı korumak için onlara tüm gerçeği söylemeliyim

tüm tavsiyelerinizi bilmek isterim"
"I’ve been here for almost 10 hours. The mom said she shouldn’t be too much longer at 10:30pm (it’s 12:15am now)

I texted at 11:30 just to check in. No reply.

There’s severe thunderstorms &amp; massive flooding in my area. I need to get home too.. nobody is replying &amp; I have no emergency contacts either.

I’m freaking out. I just wanna go home. I don’t know what to do.

 UPDATE: sorry everyone for the late update. I was so tired and PASSED out when I got home.

The parents got back when the storm started to settle down. They came in EXTREMELY drunk. The mom said that she lost her phone and couldn’t find it that’s why she didn’t reply. She said they decided to drink with their coworkers to wait the storm out.

They were so drunk they didn’t even pay me properly, but at that point I just wanted to go home so I left. I made it home safely.

Thank you all for your support &amp; advice. ❤️

"So, my son has been acting like a nazi for the past few months, and I'm talking about hardcore nazi. He constantly makes rude comments about blacks, gay people, transgenders, it even got to a point that he physically assaulted a gay kid at school. I tried talking with him, asking him why he thinks the way he does, even grounding him, but he doesn't budge. He has a group of other nazi skinhead kids and they constantly mess with minorities, get in fight etc. I don't know how to stop his behavior, I don't know why he's like this. People have told me how this is just a phase and that he'll grow out of it, but I'm still scared. I'm scared he will get beat up for this behavior. I'm scared he'll do something to his own family, he said multiple times that he'll beat up his own cousin for being transgender. Any advice on how I can change this?","Oğlum son birkaç aydır bir Nazi gibi davranıyor ve ben hardcore bir Nazi'den bahsediyorum, sürekli olarak siyahlar, eşcinseller, transseksüeller hakkında kaba yorumlar yapıyor, hatta okulda bir eşcinsel çocuğa fiziksel saldırıda bulunacak kadar ileri gitti, onunla konuşmaya çalıştım, neden böyle düşündüğünü sordum, hatta onu cezalandırdım ama hiç taviz vermedi, bir grup başka Nazi skinhead çocuğu var ve sürekli azınlıklarla uğraşıyorlar, kavga ediyorlar vs. Davranışını nasıl durduracağımı bilmiyorum, neden böyle olduğunu bilmiyorum, insanlar bana bunun sadece bir dönem olduğunu ve büyüyüp bunun üstesinden geleceğini söylediler ama hala korkuyorum, bu davranışı yüzünden dövüleceğinden korkuyorum, kendi ailesine bir şey yapacağından korkuyorum, birkaç kez kuzenini transseksüel olduğu için döveceğini söyledi, bunu nasıl değiştirebileceğime dair bir tavsiyeniz var mı?"
"My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years now. We have a great thing going together and I love her with all my heart. We have a pretty healthy relationship, as we communicate our feelings and our problems together. Recently she's brought up how she feels about my unexpected boners when we're trying to share cute moments together cuddling or hugging. She's explained how it makes her uncomfortable sometimes because she feels like I'm turning everything sexual. And this makes her feel like she's just a sexual object to me. This is definitely not the case though, because I love sharing cute moments with her. I don't just think about having sex with her, but I can't control it when I get a boner. What can I do?","kız arkadaşım ve ben bir yıldan biraz fazla bir süredir birlikteyiz ve birlikte harika bir şeyimiz var ve onu tüm kalbimle seviyorum, duygularımızı ve sorunlarımızı birlikte ilettiğimiz için oldukça sağlıklı bir ilişkimiz var, yakın zamanda birlikte sarılıp kucaklaştığımızda beklenmedik ereksiyonlarım hakkında neler hissettiğini dile getirdi, bazen bunun onu rahatsız ettiğini çünkü her şeyi cinselliğe dönüştürdüğümü hissettiğini ve bunun ona benim için sadece cinsel bir obje gibi hissettirdiğini açıkladı, ancak durum kesinlikle böyle değil çünkü onunla sevimli anlar paylaşmayı seviyorum, sadece onunla seks yapmayı düşünmüyorum ama ereksiyon olduğumda bunu kontrol edemiyorum, ne yapabilirim?"
"My husband to be (25M) has always been a very caring and devoted person to both me (29F) and our daughter (5F). He does a lot for us and up until this point has made us the centre of his world. We have been together for 7 years and he rarely drinks and has gone on nights out with his friends without me a total of about 5 times during our entire relationship. Him not going on nights out without me has nothing to do with me at all, I am happy for him to go out and have fun with his friends but he insists nights out without me aren’t as fun for him. 

5 weeks ago he went on a weekend away to Amsterdam for his stag party. When he left to go on the trip he was checking in with me regularly, telling me what they were doing and how things were going. My dad and my best friend of 27 years were among the group of guys that went with him but besides that I had absolutely no doubt in my mind that he would do anything because he just never seemed to be that kind of person. However, after a few hours of texting me the first day he got there, communication stopped. I didn’t mind this as he was on his stag enjoying himself and I didn’t expect him to text me the entire time he was there. 

The following day he checked in a couple of times and that was it. That night I had the worst feeling in my gut and I checked his location on snap maps and he had turned his location off but his last known location was the red light district. My heart sank but I didn’t want to jump to conclusions. I text him to ask him if he would let me know when he got back to the hotel so that I could get to sleep as I was worried and wanted to make sure he got back ok. What I received was the most disgusting vile responses I have ever seen from anyone let alone my partner. He attacked me with text after text saying I was ruining his night and could I not just f**k off and let him enjoy his night with his friends, he would remember this and he would return the favour by f**cking up my hen weekend for me the following weekend. I didn’t know who this man was and I cried myself to sleep that night. 

The following day he was coming home and I hadn’t heard a thing from him until he arrived that evening. When he got home he didn’t even say hello to neither me nor our daughter and just sat there stuck to his phone for hours. I asked him what had happened over the weekend and he kept insisting nothing happened. I told him I saw he turned his location off in the red light district and once again he went on the defensive saying he didn’t do anything and he wasn’t going to be accused when he did nothing wrong. 

The following morning he woke me up saying he was ready to try for another baby and was kissing me with so much love and affection and I was a bit taken aback because it was so different from the person he was the previous days. One thing led to another and we had sex. 

For the days proceeding I just couldn’t shake the feeling something happened and kept trying to get some information from him but he kept denying and getting angry about it. I know I shouldn’t have but I went through his phone and saw a text from tinder with a verification code from the Friday night which was the first night of his stag. I woke him up and confronted him about it and he once again denied being on tinder until I showed him the message as proof and he then said he downloaded it but didn’t use it. This didn’t sit well with me at all and we argued for days. Eventually, the night before I was due to leave to go on my own trip for my hen party, I told him that I knew something happened and it was his chance to admit it. He then admitted they went to a peep show but that he thought it was weird. With more pushing he then admitted he went into a prostitute but swore he didn’t do anything and wasn’t able to bring himself to do anything that he just walked out. Further pushing and he eventually admitted he slept with the prostitute. 

I am absolutely devastated. I can’t explain the hurt I am feeling about this betrayal. He has admitted he waited until my dad and best friend went back to the hotel and another one of his friends paid for him to sleep with the prostitute. This “friend” is also supposed to be a groomsman at our wedding. 

I am so completely confused. On one hand this is so completely out of character for him so I want to forgive him and go ahead with the wedding but on the other hand I absolutely hate him for doing this and don’t know if I can forgive him. We are due to get married next week and I still don’t know what to do. On top of the hurt of him cheating to begin with I am also dealing with the fact he has ruined an entire once in a lifetime experience for me. He ruined my hen, he had ruined the lead up to the wedding as I am supposed to be so excited but instead I am absolutely heartbroken and he has possibly ruined the wedding itself too. I don’t know how I can look this man in the eye and take his vows seriously when he has already broken them. 

He is incredibly remorseful and is fighting tooth and nail to do everything he can for me and our daughter but I am so unbelievably broken. 

Has anyone had similar experience? Did you forgive and try to move on with eachother? Did it work out? Am I setting myself up for a life of misery if I marry this man? Please please help me wrap my head around all of this. 

TLDR husband to be had a personality change on his stag weekend and slept with a prostitute. We are due to get married next week, I don’t know what to do.

"Tonight we decided to look at his phones internet history and for the last month or so he has been searching very graphic pornography on a regular basis. We are currently installing parental blocks on the phone, but the content he is looking up has us worried. Rape, bestiality, abusing women. He has also searched for gay porn and his friends mom caught her son and him touching eachother. We are trying for a kid but i am now concerned for a new child's safety. I really do not know what to do and need some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

edit:       thanks for the good advice, parental controls where already being reinstalled as i posted this. they where only taken off for 2 weeks so he could play pokemon go. several of you are jumping to conclusions about bad parenting for not having a child block on his internet. we did and we talked to him about what was expected with his online activity. we thought we could trust him for 2 weeks not to go down this path.

&amp;#x200B;

edit 2: we are not worried about him being gay/straight. we will love him no matter what. only added that info because we where not sure if there was a correlation between that and having been molested in the past. Should have worded that better.

&amp;#x200B;

edit 3: we had a long hard discussion today. everyone was calm and it was a safe space. we talked about consent and why what he was looking up was wrong and he seemed to understand. He explained that these things where going around the school and even gave us the names of several students who where doing this as well. we asked if anyone had inappropriately touched him in the past and he said no. we will still be sending him to therapy as well as me and his mom to hopefully undo some of the possible damage and so we can better parent. he has some other things going on as well that a therapist can help with so its not just for the porn.","bu gece telefonunun internet geçmişine bakmaya karar verdik ve son bir aydır düzenli olarak çok ayrıntılı pornografi arıyordu şu anda telefona ebeveyn engellemeleri yüklüyoruz ancak aradığı içerik bizi endişelendiriyor tecavüz hayvanlarla cinsel ilişki kadınlara taciz ayrıca eşcinsel pornosu da aradı ve arkadaşının annesi oğlunu ve oğlunu birbirlerine dokunurken yakaladı bir çocuk istiyoruz ancak şimdi yeni bir çocuğun güvenliği konusunda endişeliyim ne yapacağımı gerçekten bilmiyorum ve biraz tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var

"I (52M) have been married to my wife (51F) for 30 years and sex is ruining my life.

The last 5 years my sex drive had been fairly low and so was my wife's. Then a doctor checked my hormone levels about a year ago and started me on Testosterone Replacement Therapy. My sex drive sky rocketed and now I feel like I'm 18 again.

I want sex on a daily basis... I don't get it but the drive is there. I have a hard time being around other women because all I think about is sex. It's hard to have a conversation with another woman when all I can do is sit there and fantasize about them.

When I try to initiate sex with my wife it is so frustrating. She complains about everything I do. She isn't spontaneous at all so there is no make out session that leads to sex. I literally have to be blunt and say ""want to go to the bedroom and have sex?"" And she will say ""what are you wanting to do?"" It turns into this preplanned negotiation and I hate it.

Today I prepared drinks and snacks and asked her to meet me in the bedroom. We talked for a while and I offered her a back rub. For at least 30 minutes I rubbed her back, legs and feet. Then I initiated oral sex on her for almost an hour. She never spoke, moaned, tensed a muscle, nothing and finally asked me to stop. I laid down beside her and she didn't make any kind of effort to do anything to me. No touching, no kissing, nothing.

She makes me feel like I'm the problem and emotionally it hurts a lot. I'm at the point that I wish I had someone else to have sex with. I hate the way things are and I'm not sure this is what I want for the next 30 years of my life.

I crave affection and human touch so desperately and I'm not getting it in my relationship and I don't know what to do.

Please share your thoughts or questions with me. Thanks.

EDIT:
1. My doctor put me on Testosterone Replacement Therapy because I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. It has made a positive effect on my life. The increase of my sex drive just came along with it.
2. I should have said that I think about sex on a daily basis. I'm not asking my partner to have sex everyday, sometimes not every week. 
3. I do not offer back rubs and such in hopes of getting sex as a reward. I'm very happy to do nice things for my partner without any expectations of having sex. During the time that I was going down on her I checked in constantly to see if she liked it and wanted me to keep going. She told me that it felt good, but she just could not climax that day,
4. We do have a communication problem, this I know. If you care to know, tonight we downloaded the Paired app from the play store and have started using it which is a lot of fun. I agree that we should probably go to therapy but we live in a small town and good therapist are hard to come by.
5. I desperately need affection in a non-sexual sense and I'm currently not getting that in  my relationship. This is something I need to communicate better.
6. The infomation in my post does not give an accurate snapshot of our 30 year relationship. If you've been in a long term relationship then you know there are a lot of ebbs and flows and it takes work to stay together for that amount of time. Yes, you are only getting a glimpse of my side of the story. I've always been told there are 3 sides to every story, my side, your side, and the truth.
7. Most importantly, I do not to leave or give up on my relationship. I want to work to make it better for both of us.","Yıllardır karım f ile evliyim ve seks hayatımı mahvediyor

Son yıllarda cinsel isteğim oldukça düşüktü ve karımınki de öyleydi, sonra bir doktor yaklaşık bir yıl önce hormon seviyelerimi kontrol etti ve bana testosteron replasman tedavisine başladı, cinsel isteğim fırladı ve şimdi tekrar eskisi gibi hissediyorum

Her gün seks istiyorum ama alamıyorum ama istek var, başka kadınların yanında olmakta zorlanıyorum çünkü tek düşündüğüm seks, başka bir kadınla sohbet etmek zor, tek yapabildiğim orada oturup onlar hakkında fanteziler kurmak

Karımla seks başlatmaya çalıştığımda çok sinir bozucu oluyor, yaptığım her şeyden şikayet ediyor, hiç de kendiliğinden davranmıyor, bu yüzden sekse yol açan bir öpüşme seansı yok, kelimenin tam anlamıyla açık sözlü olup yatak odasına gidip seks yapmak istiyorum demek zorundayım ve o da ne yapmak istiyorsun diyor, bu önceden planlanmış bir pazarlığa dönüşüyor ve bundan nefret ediyorum

Bugün içecekler ve atıştırmalıklar hazırladım ve ondan yatak odasında buluşmasını istedim, bir süre konuştuk ve ona sırt masajı teklif ettim en az birkaç dakika sırt bacaklarını ve ayaklarını ovuşturdum sonra neredeyse bir saat boyunca ona oral seks yaptım hiç konuşmadı inledi kaslarını gerdi hiçbir şey yapmadı ve sonunda durmamı istedi yanına uzandım ve bana hiçbir şey yapmak için hiçbir çaba göstermedi dokunma yok öpüşme yok

bana sorun benmişim gibi hissettiriyor ve duygusal olarak çok acıtıyor keşke seks yapabileceğim başka biri olsaydı dediğim noktadayım işlerin gidişatından nefret ediyorum ve hayatımın sonraki yıllarında bunun istediğim şey olduğundan emin değilim

çok çaresizce şefkat ve insan dokunuşu arzuluyorum ve ilişkimde bunu alamıyorum ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum

lütfen düşüncelerinizi veya sorularınızı benimle paylaşın teşekkürler

düzenle
doktorum kronik yorgunluk sendromum olduğu için beni testosteron replasman tedavisine aldırdı hayatımda olumlu bir etki yarattı cinsel isteğim de bununla birlikte arttı
söylemeliydim ki günlük olarak seks düşünüyorum partnerimden her gün seks yapmasını istemiyorum bazen her hafta değil
sevimli bir ödül olarak seks almak umuduyla sırt masajı ve benzeri şeyler teklif etmiyorum çok mutluyum partnerim için herhangi bir beklenti olmadan güzel şeyler yapmak için ona oral seks yaptığım süre boyunca bunu beğenip beğenmediğini ve devam etmemi isteyip istemediğini görmek için sürekli kontrol ettim bana iyi hissettirdiğini ama o gün orgazma ulaşamadığını söyledi
bir iletişim sorunumuz var bunu biliyorum eğer bilmek isterseniz bu gece play store'dan eşleştirilmiş uygulamayı indirdik ve kullanmaya başladık, çok eğlenceli, muhtemelen terapiye gitmemiz gerektiğine katılıyorum ama küçük bir kasabada yaşıyoruz ve iyi terapist bulmak zor
cinsel olmayan anlamda şefkate çok ihtiyacım var ve şu anda ilişkimde bunu alamıyorum bunu daha iyi iletmem gerekiyor
gönderimdeki bilgiler yıllık ilişkimizin doğru bir anlık görüntüsünü vermiyor eğer uzun süreli bir ilişkiniz varsa o zaman çok fazla iniş çıkış olduğunu ve o kadar uzun süre birlikte kalmak için çaba gerektiğini bilirsiniz evet sadece hikayemin bir kısmını görüyorsunuz bana her hikayenin bir tarafı olduğu söylendi benim tarafım senin tarafın ve gerçek
en önemlisi ayrılmamak veya vazgeçmemek ilişkimizi ikimiz için de daha iyi hale getirmek için çalışmak istiyorum"
"-So I know this friend of mine has had three ways with his wife, with a second dude and with a second women. He has never asked me or really ever talked to much about it with me, however we have been friends for 15+ years. 
- I recently broke up with a long term girlfriend (4+ years) 

- the other night we were hanging out and he showed me his phone and there was text message between him and his wife that pretty much went like this “

Wife- did you ask him yet 
Friend- no, I don’t know how to ask and don’t want to just randomly bring it up
Wife- well ask him already, if you guys both come back here I’ll suck both of you dry right now, I’m so horny   “

We were drinking and I was very drunk and kinda didn’t know how to respond, I didn’t say no, I didn’t say yes. Was kinda just like omg that’s crazyyyy and then pondered the idea for a while. We were with  a group of other people drinking so we were not talking out loud about any of this. 

Not sure what to do

- I would 100% be down to f*ck his wife lol but don’t know how I feel about doing it with him being involved lol, I’m 100% straight and have never had a three way 
- I don’t want to ruin our friendship either 
- however I have not had sex in a while and I am very intrigued

What is some advice to move forward and should I? The only thing making me feel uncomfortable about it is him being involved tbh or am I just being insecure, I’m just not gay at all and it feels kinda gay for two men to have sex with one girl or am I being dumb. 

EDIT: well now I feel obligated to update this post when all is figured out. Thank you everyone for the advice. Update to come by the weekend more than likely.

yakın zamanda uzun süreli bir kız arkadaşımla ayrıldım

geçen gece takılıyorduk ve bana telefonunu gösterdi ve karısıyla arasında aşağı yukarı şöyle bir mesaj vardı

karım ona sordun mu

arkadaşım hayır nasıl soracağımı bilmiyorum ve rastgele açmak da istemiyorum
karım ona sor artık ikiniz de buraya geri dönerseniz ikinizi de şu anda kuruturum çok azgınım

içiyorduk ve çok sarhoştum ve nasıl cevap vereceğimi bilmiyordum hayır demedim evet demedim sadece aman tanrım bu çılgınlık gibiydi ve sonra bir süre bu fikri düşündüm bir grup başka insanla içiyorduk bu yüzden bunların hiçbiri hakkında yüksek sesle konuşmuyorduk

ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum

karısını becermeye varım lol ama bunu yapmak hakkında ne hissettiğimi bilmiyorum onun dahil olmasıyla lol heteroseksüelim ve hiç üçlü yapmadım
ben de arkadaşlığımızı mahvetmek istemiyorum
ancak bir süredir seks yapmadım ve çok merak ediyorum

ilerlemek için bazı tavsiyeler nelerdir ve beni rahatsız eden tek şey onun dahil olması mı yoksa sadece güvensiz mi davranıyorum ben hiç eşcinsel değilim ve iki erkeğin bir kızla seks yapması biraz eşcinsel gibi geliyor yoksa aptal mıyım

düzenle şimdi her şey çözüldüğünde bu gönderiyi güncellemek zorunda hissediyorum tavsiyeler için herkese teşekkür ederim büyük ihtimalle hafta sonuna kadar güncelleme gelecek"
"I’ve been on the edge for a minute with my husband, but when he defended Nicki Minaj’s husband for raping a 15 year old girl at knife point… saying he could be different now… which could be true…. I just…. Felt like I need to leave. No kids yet. Only animals. I moved states for him and have taken a big pay decrease in the state we live in… but idk where to start on making an exit plan… I love him but love is not enough. Idk what to do. He’s the main money maker. ","Kocamla bir dakikadır uçurumun kenarındayım ama o, bıçak zoruyla bir yaşındaki bir kıza tecavüz eden Nicki Minaj'ın kocasını savunduğunda, artık farklı olabileceğini söyledi, ki bu doğru olabilir, sadece çocuk bırakmamam gerektiğini hissettim, sadece hayvanlar. Onun için eyalet değiştirdim ve yaşadığımız eyalette büyük bir maaş kesintisi yaptım ama bir çıkış planı yapmaya nereden başlayacağımı bilmiyorum, onu seviyorum ama aşk yeterli değil, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, o ana para getiren kişi."
"I'm about to go swimming in 20 minutes, and I'm  feeling very insecure about my body. I only have one swimsuit, which is a bikini. I'm 30, and my husband asked if I've ever thought about getting a one-piece. He also mentioned that he thinks I'm too old for a bikini. What do you all think? For context, I'm not overweight—just a normal weight. 

Ever since I turned 30, I've been getting a lot of backhanded comments from him and his grandmother, telling me I need to dress a certain way because of my age, like not wearing tank tops at the gym and other things etc. It's so annoying! What do you all think?","Birkaç dakika içinde yüzmeye gideceğim ve vücudum hakkında çok güvensiz hissediyorum, sadece bir mayo giyiyorum, o da bikini. Eşim ve ben hiç tek parça almayı düşünüp düşünmediğimi sordu, ayrıca bikini giymek için çok yaşlı olduğumu düşünüyor, siz ne düşünüyorsunuz? Ben kilolu değilim, sadece normal kilodayım

Ben doğduğumdan beri ondan ve büyükannesinden yaşım nedeniyle belirli bir şekilde giyinmem gerektiğini söyleyen çok fazla ters yorum alıyorum, örneğin spor salonunda atlet giymemem ve diğer şeyler vb. çok sinir bozucu, siz ne düşünüyorsunuz?"
"Update:

So this exploded and I got a ton of great advice. Thank you all! I followed the overwhelming consensus to talk to my wife. It was a hard conversation and she was pretty mad. But only for about an hour then she came around and realized her anger with me was just because she couldn’t direct it at her friend right then. 

I am still in the dog house for not telling her the first time this happened. I can’t blame her. I should have come clean. That would have been the smarter thing to do, but my wife said she understood why I handled it that way. It wasn’t the best but not the worst. We will work through it and I’m confident that I haven’t completely lost all trust. 

As for our so called friend, we don’t know what we are going to do. It will take some time for my wife to work out her feelings and how to handle the friendship. For now we are just going to keep our distance and not interact. It should be easy with the holidays and both families being pretty busy. 

I want to thank everyone for the advice. I think I just needed to hear people say that telling my wife was the right thing to do and that we would be able to work through this.

I (35M) have been married for ten years. I am very happy with my wife. That sounds cliché, but it is absolutely true. We have neighbors that live five houses down the street from us who are our best friends. Our kids are best friends and they come and go in both houses like it is their own. 

A year ago I lent the wife of our friends my GoPro for a trip to the Caribbean. This was a trip with her High School friends and she wanted to take it snorkeling. When she returned it a week later I found nsfw photos and videos saved on the memory card. I deleted them and decided not to tell anyone. Just assumed it was a mistake and it was none of my business. I didn’t tell anyone and that was a mistake. 

Because, fast forward to this week, and she asked if she could borrow the GoPro again. I was not at home at the time, and she asked my wife. Had I been home, I would’ve come up with some excuse for why I needed it, but my wife had no context or reason to so she obviously lent it to her best friend. Yesterday our friend returned the camera. I was home with just the kids And my wife was running some errands, when she returned it. She said “thanks for letting me borrow this again. I got some great photos that I think you will like when you see them.” I had basically forgotten what happened a year ago and just assumed she was referring to social media. Today I turned on the camera to see if it was charged, and found more of the same type of photos.

There have been no other signs at least that I have picked up on that she is interested. And I have certainly not given any signs. We are friendly, but it’s definitely not flirtatious. What do I do? Could it be an honest mistake twice in a row? That seems unlikely. Our lives are intertwined so I can’t go no contact without red flags. Plus, our kids are best friend and they would never understand. Hell, I coach their daughter’s soccer team. Do I tell my wife? Or is that just going to make it worse?

I’m furious she put me in this situation, on purpose or not. It seems careless at best and malicious at worst. What do I do?","güncelleme

bu patladı ve bir sürü harika tavsiye aldım hepinize teşekkür ederim eşimle konuşmak için ezici bir fikir birliğine uydum zor bir konuşmaydı ve oldukça sinirliydi ama sadece bir saat kadar sonra kendine geldi ve bana olan öfkesinin sadece o anda arkadaşına yöneltemediği için olduğunu fark etti

ilk seferinde ona söylemediğim için hala köpek kulübesindeyim onu ​​suçlayamam temiz olmalıydım bu yapılacak daha akıllıca şey olurdu ama eşim neden bu şekilde davrandığımı anladığını söyledi en iyisi değildi ama en kötüsü de değildi bunun üstesinden geleceğiz ve tüm güvenimi tamamen kaybetmediğimden eminim

sözde arkadaşımıza gelince ne yapacağımızı bilmiyoruz eşimin duygularını ve arkadaşlığı nasıl idare edeceğini anlaması biraz zaman alacak şimdilik sadece mesafemizi koruyacağız ve etkileşime girmeyeceğiz tatiller ve her iki aile de oldukça meşgul olduğu için kolay olmalı

tavsiyeleri için herkese teşekkür etmek istiyorum sanırım sadece insanların eşimle konuşmanın doğru şey olduğunu ve bunu başarabileceğimizi söylemelerini duymaya ihtiyacım vardı bunun üstesinden gelmek için

on yıldır evliyim, karımla çok mutluyum, klişe gibi gelebilir ama kesinlikle doğru, bizden beş ev aşağıda oturan komşularımız var, en iyi arkadaşlarımız, çocuklarımız en iyi arkadaşlar ve her iki eve de kendi evleriymiş gibi girip çıkıyorlar

bir yıl önce arkadaşlarımızın karısına karayiplere bir gezi için gopro'mu ödünç verdim, bu lise arkadaşlarıyla yaptığı bir geziydi ve onu şnorkelle yüzmeye götürmek istedi, bir hafta sonra geri verdiğinde hafıza kartında kayıtlı nsfw fotoğraflar ve videolar buldum, onları sildim ve kimseye söylememeye karar verdim, bunun bir hata olduğunu ve beni ilgilendirmediğini varsaydım, kimseye söylemedim ve bu bir hataydı

çünkü bu haftaya hızlıca ilerleyelim ve gopro'yu tekrar ödünç alabilir mi diye sordu, o sırada evde değildim ve karıma evde olsaydım neden ihtiyacım olduğunu açıklayan bir bahane bulurdum ama karımın bunun için bir bağlamı veya nedeni yoktu, bu yüzden dün en iyi arkadaşına ödünç vermiş, arkadaşımız kamerayı geri verdi, ben evdeydim sadece çocuklar ve eşim birkaç iş için dışarı çıkmışken geri getirdiğinde bana tekrar ödünç verdiğin için teşekkür etti, bence gördüğünüzde beğeneceğiniz harika fotoğraflar çektim, bir yıl önce ne olduğunu temelde unutmuştum ve sadece sosyal medyadan bahsettiğini varsaydım, bugün şarj olup olmadığını görmek için kamerayı açtım ve aynı türden daha fazla fotoğraf buldum

en azından onun ilgilendiğine dair başka bir işaret almadım ve kesinlikle arkadaş canlısı olduğumuza dair hiçbir işaret vermedim ama kesinlikle flörtöz değil ne yapmalıyım? üst üste iki kez dürüst bir hata olabilir mi, bu pek olası görünmüyor hayatlarımız iç içe geçmiş durumda, bu yüzden kırmızı bayraklar olmadan iletişimi kesemem ayrıca çocuklarımız en iyi arkadaşlar ve asla anlamayacaklar, kızlarının futbol takımına koçluk yapıyorum, karıma söylemeli miyim yoksa bu durumu daha da mı kötüleştirecek

beni bilerek mi yoksa bilmeyerek mi bu duruma soktuğuna çok öfkeliyim, en iyi ihtimalle dikkatsiz, en kötü ihtimalle kötü niyetli görünüyor, ne yapmalıyım?"
"Long story short. I (18) had my birthday yesterday and got two piercings. I then learned my boyfriend (17) doesn’t like piercings. Or tattoos. Or dyed hair. All of which, I want. He’s trying to convince me to not get any of these things, but I’m pretty set. I’ve been set ever since I can remember. At the same time though, I know he doesn’t like those things. What should I do?

Edit: I dumped him. There were many other factors leading to this break up. It’s been hard but I genuinely feel like this can lead to healing from me.","uzun lafın kısası dün doğum günümdü ve iki piercing yaptırdım sonra erkek arkadaşımın piercing, dövme veya boyalı saç sevmediğini öğrendim ki bunların hiçbirini istemiyorum beni bunların hiçbirini yaptırmamaya ikna etmeye çalışıyor ama ben oldukça kararlıyım hatırladığım kadarıyla her zaman kararlıyım aynı zamanda o da bunları sevmez ne yapmalıyım

düzenle onu terk ettim bu ayrılığa yol açan başka birçok faktör vardı zor oldu ama gerçekten bunun benden iyileşmemi sağlayacağını düşünüyorum"
"
basically the title. i'm truly at a loss here, i have no idea what to do. this truthfully feels like some shit i'd watch in a TV show. 
two days ago my best friend of ten years asked me if we can ""share"" my girlfriend of 9 months. 
he told me he felt a ""strong connection"" with her, and he believes the feeling is mutual. 
while it's true they get along like friends from what i've seen, i've never noticed anything more. they never hang out alone, and my girlfriend has never mentioned anything about this or him ever, so i completely believe it's just my friend being fucking weird.  
he told me he wasn't asking to date her, just basically have sex with her. obviously, i said no. i'm EXTREMELY sure she'd say no too. i genuinely thought he was joking just based on the amount of confidence he had while he asked. i want to stress that this is totally out of the blue for him to even propose. yeah, i noticed he liked hanging around her but she's great company so i couldn't completely blame him. i just never thought about it. 
i couldn't even accidentally have a nightmare this ridiculous. he told me that if i said no, he'd tell my girlfriend that i cheated on my ex, then ""probably stop being friends"" with me if i ""denied what was obvious."" yes, i cheated. it happened once, i was drunk and very very VERY remorseful. 
this guy has been with me for TEN years, through thick and thin and all the hells of my life. the fact that he's given me this ultimatum has put me beside myself and the amount of anxiety this has caused me is genuinely ruining everything. i see my girlfriend tomorrow and i want to mention something but i don't know what to say. 
the last thing my friend told me is that i'd ""better decide soon."" 
what do i even begin to do?","temelde başlık gerçekten burada kaybolmuş durumdayım ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum bu gerçekten bir televizyon programında izlenecek bir bok gibi hissettiriyor
iki gün önce on yıllık en iyi arkadaşım bana aylardır birlikte olduğum kız arkadaşımı paylaşabilir miyiz diye sordu
bana onunla güçlü bir bağ hissettiğini ve bu hissin karşılıklı olduğuna inandığını söyledi
doğru olsa da gördüğüm kadarıyla arkadaş gibi anlaşıyorlar daha fazlasını hiç fark etmedim asla yalnız takılmıyorlar ve kız arkadaşım bundan veya ondan hiç bahsetmedi bu yüzden bunun sadece arkadaşımın garip davranmasına bağlı olduğuna tamamen inanıyorum
bana onunla çıkmak istemediğini sadece onunla seks yapmak istediğini söyledi açıkçası hayır dedim onun da hayır diyeceğinden son derece eminim şaka yaptığını düşündüm sadece sorduğu sıradaki özgüvenine dayanarak bunun tamamen ani bir teklif olduğunu vurgulamak istiyorum evet onun etrafında dolaşmayı sevdiğini fark ettim ama harika bir arkadaş bu yüzden onu tamamen suçlayamam sadece bunu hiç düşünmedim
kazara bile bu kadar saçma bir kabus göremezdim bana hayır dersem kız arkadaşıma onu aldattığımı söyleyeceğini söyledi eski sevgilimle arkadaşlığımı kesersem muhtemelen açıkça ortada olanı inkar edersem evet aldattım bir kere oldu sarhoştum ve çok çok çok pişmandım
bu adam benimle on yıldır iyi günde kötü günde ve hayatımın tüm cehennemlerinde birlikteydi bana bu ültimatomu vermiş olması beni kendimden geçirdi ve bunun bana verdiği kaygı miktarı gerçekten her şeyi mahvediyor yarın kız arkadaşımı görüyorum ve bir şey söylemek istiyorum ama ne söyleyeceğimi bilmiyorum
arkadaşımın bana söylediği son şey yakında karar vermem gerektiğiydi

"Going on 3 1/2 weeks ago, I came home from work to find my roommate of 4 years to be completely different. In the 4 years we've lived together, he has been rather disheveled with a devil may care attitude. Always did the bare minimum in chores/hygiene/etc. 

When I cam home that day, I legitimately thought he was a different person. He had a haircut and shaved (I had never seen him without a beard) with decent clothes instead of his normal sweatpants and a tank top. On top of that, the entire apartment was cleaned to perfection. Every day since then he has been getting up around 4am to head to the gym. From what I understand, he works out for about 4 hours then comes home and he's lost noticeable weight already.  He works from home in a business he created so he is usually home all day. He stopped ordering out and is cooking full meals and cleans everyday. The few family and friends he's had over say it's like he finally woke back up because this is how he apparently used to be but depression and injury seemed to kill his joy in life (their words not mine). 

 It's like night and day with how he is acting. We got along before, but he is actually engaging in life now. Our lease is up in May and I'd hate to see my roommate go back to how he was a few weeks ago. How can I help my roommate continue this?","haftalar önce işten eve geldiğimde yıllardır birlikte olduğum oda arkadaşımın tamamen farklı olduğunu gördüm birlikte yaşadığımız yıllarda oldukça dağınık ve umursamaz bir tavır sergiliyordu her zaman asgari düzeyde ev işi yapıyordu

"I17m have been with my gf16 for 7 months. Since it’s summer my moms been letting her over to the house, we were taking a nap and when we woke up it was time to go and she stood up and there was a stain on her shorts and my bed. She started crying and practically ran out my house, I tried telling her it was okay. I have 3 sisters, I’m aware of what a period is. I wasn’t mad or nothing. She sent me like 6 text saying how sorry she was, and I told her it was fine she hasn’t answered nothing. I keep texting her and telling her it was okay but she won’t answer nothing. I really love her, and I don’t want her to be embarrassed. I don’t want us to break up over this. She hasn’t texted me back in 3 days and we usually text everyday.

"Title. They've been having relationship problems lately, and her husband recently voiced concerns that she's been cheating on him. She knew we were going to be out of town this week and asked if she could stay at our house. I got a notification on the camera app and sure enough, she can be seen walking up to the house, with a male guest behind her. He can clearly be heard asking ""you want me to to go over there?"" and seen pointing towards the gate that leads to the rear entrance, and she smiles and nods at him.

This situation will almost certainly change several peoples' lives and change a lot of family dynamics.

"My (41F) husband (39 forever) died in June 2023, and he was my daughter’s (6) best friend. He got a sample of weed from a client bc his back hurt that happened to be laced with fentanyl and xylazine (sp?). Kind of ironic he was against opiates and thought mj was safe… it’s not legal where i live. Anyway, i accidentally fell asleep in my 9yos room putting him to bed and found him in the morning. My 6yo is asking how he died and im not sure how to tell her he did a drug that had poison in it and he didn’t know. How do you say this in age-appropriate language? Before he died he had some health problems undiagnosed and lost his balance a lot and had two seizures so she asked me if he ‘fell down again’. She doesn’t know what drugs are. Any advice appreciated.","Kocam haziran ayında öldü ve kızımın en iyi arkadaşıydı, sırtı ağrıdığı için bir müşterisinden bir ot örneği aldı ve buna fentanil ve ksilazin sp karıştırılmıştı.

"I live in a really cold area and everyday when im driving back i home i see this little girl ( maybe early teen?) Walking with her school backpack and no hoodie or anything to keep her warm. At first i didn't pay any attention, but then i kept seeing her every single day and i started to get worried. She is visibly shaking because its freezing, and the fact that no one is driving her home and she dosent even have some coat or a hoodie makes me think somthings going on at her house, it really hurts my heart seeing her like this. I try to avoid looking at her because i know its gonna seem weird  but sometimes i can't help but notice that she looks like she's crying and her face is red. A week ago i decided to finally do something, i took one of my old hoodies and tried to give it to her. She seemed scared and hesitant at first but she took everything and said thank you  with the biggest smile in her face, yesterday it was raining, i left work and drove fast cuz i know she's gonna be walking in the rain, i found her. She was still wearing the hoodie, but that wont help in a rainy day. I know i probably shouldn't,  but i asked her to get in. She refused and kept walking, i thought of following her to see where she lives but that would be like a million time creepier. Besides, what would i even do if i did?
She's probably sick now, and i literally can't sleep thinking about her, can i tell someone? Police? Would her teachers or principal be able to help if told them?

"Hi all my last update my removed but if anyone is interested I thought I’d post the latest and get some advice. 

I got a call from Dani. Daniel has been ever present and I’m guessing it was because he knew she was going to call. There’s a lot more to the story. 

The first night was normal as I said but in the Saturday Alex Jeb and their friend decided not to go scuba diving with Dani Daniel and Marcus.  Dani was feeling very hungover and gave up after an hour and went back to the airb&amp;b. She walked into the living room to find all three guys engaging in sexual acts with two women. Jeb shouted at her to get out as this was costing them a fortune. The women were escorts. 

She left and went back to the boat and only told Marcus what she saw. When they all went back later Alex told her to not tell me as it was just his last bit of freedom. She told him she was disgusted with him and that he wasn’t free. She told him she would have to think about what to do. Marcus convinced her to stay another night as he and Daniel had met the two girls the night before and were seeing them again that night and if Dani wanted to leave then Daniel would have to take her as he was her ride and there wasn’t public transport in the tiny town. 

So Alex cheated as did the other two. Marcus told their wives that morning but not me. He was going to do it in stages as he knew I was in shock. The actual assault went further than Marcus told me also. And while Alex hadn’t actually done anything beyond pulling off her clothes ( unlike the other two ) he stood by and watched and did nothing to help her. 
She said she thought he had taken shrooms  earlier but couldn’t be sure. 
Marcus and Daniel did rescue her but things had already escalated.

She went to the police immediately she got to her parents. The Airbnb owners had also gone independently when they saw the footage. All three men are facing the consequences of their actions. Dani told me she was sorry she didn’t leave  tell me immediately like she wanted to do. She is very distraught still I didn’t want to make things worse for her. 

I don’t think I am needed for any legal proceedings so I finally blocked Alex and his parents. The wedding is cancelled. And I’m just starting to disentangle myself from Alex on bank accounts and such. 

Here’s my issue. I’m feeling very angry towards Marcus. It feels like he didn’t really care about me. He stopped Dani from telling me so he could continue to shack up with the girl he met. He apparently feels guilty because if they had left Dani would not have been attacked. He didn’t do me the courtesy  of telling me that Alex cheated that morning like he did with the other two wives . It’s not like he was sparing my feelings because my ex assaulting another woman was a pretty damn bad thing to hear. He didn’t tell me the full extent of the attack. Dani is still unsure if Alex wasn’t just “waiting his turn” or he all he was going to do was watch. I should have been told that asap. And not from Dani because the conversation was incredibly difficult for her. Daniel didn’t know about the escorts at all and didn’t know Marcus hasn’t shared the full story of what they saw when they burst in. Daniel has been my rock.  I need some perspective here. Is it ok  to be angry at Marcus? Is it misplaced anger? I’m pretty angry at Alex though and that’s all I feel towards him. Can anyone give me a different perspective im missing? Marcus and I had been in constant contact. He’s already back at work so it was messages /texts and occasional calls. He actually visited last night but I didn’t open the door to him.  Daniel is saying whatever I feel right now is ok. But I think he’s just placating me. I don’t know who to trust anymore. 

I don’t have to have any more contact with Alex and think the case will move along without me. I’m thinking of telling Daniel that I need a break from him and Marcus and that group of friends. Dani and I have said we will stay in touch but I can’t see us being very close. My best friend who I finally confided in thinks I should just step away from them all now for good and try to move forward. My parents agree and think it’s necessary for healing. My brother thinks Daniel has been nothing but great and I shouldn’t cut him off.  But they all seem to be a package deal but without Alex now obviously. So I think it’s probably all or nothing. What should I do? I don’t want to be ungrateful but a clean break feels right. ","merhaba herkese son güncellemem kaldırıldı ama ilgilenen varsa son güncellemeyi yayınlayıp biraz tavsiye almak istedim

dani daniel'den bir telefon aldım her zaman oradaydı ve sanırım bunun sebebi onun arayacağını bilmesiydi hikayenin daha fazlası var

dediğim gibi ilk gece normaldi ama cumartesi günü alex jeb ve arkadaşları dani daniel ve marcus ile tüplü dalışa gitmemeye karar verdiler dani çok akşamdan kalma hissediyordu ve bir saat sonra pes etti ve airbampb'ye geri döndü oturma odasına girdi ve üç adamın iki kadınla cinsel ilişkiye girdiğini gördü jeb ona dışarı çıkmasını söyledi çünkü bu onlara bir servete mal oluyordu kadınlar eskorttu

çıktı ve tekneye geri döndü ve sadece marcus'a gördüklerini anlattı daha sonra hepsi geri döndüğünde alex ona bana söylememesini söyledi çünkü bu onun son özgürlüğüydü ona iğrendiğini ve özgür olmadığını söyledi ona ne yapacağını düşünmesi gerektiğini söyledi marcus onu bir gece daha kalmaya ikna etti çünkü o ve Daniel bir önceki gece iki kızla tanışmıştı ve o gece tekrar görüşeceklerdi ve eğer Dani gitmek isterse Daniel onu götürmek zorundaydı çünkü Daniel onun arabasıydı ve küçük kasabada toplu taşıma yoktu

yani Alex diğer ikisi gibi aldattı Marcus o sabah eşlerine söyledi ama bana söylemedi Bunu aşamalı olarak yapacağını çünkü şokta olduğumu biliyordu Gerçek saldırı Marcus'un bana söylediğinden daha ileri gitti Ayrıca Alex diğer ikisinin aksine onun kıyafetlerini çıkarmaktan öte bir şey yapmamış olsa da kenarda durup izledi ve ona yardım etmek için hiçbir şey yapmadı
Dani daha önce mantar aldığını düşündüğünü ama emin olamadığını söyledi
Marcus ve Daniel onu kurtardı ama işler çoktan çığırından çıkmıştı

Hemen polise gitti Ailesinin yanına gitti Airbnb sahipleri de görüntüleri gördüklerinde bağımsız olarak gitmişlerdi Üç adam da yaptıklarının sonuçlarıyla karşı karşıya Dani bana üzgün olduğunu söyledi Gitmediği için hemen söylemedi Bana istediği gibi hemen söylemedi Çok perişandı Yine de onun için işleri daha da kötüleştirmek istemedim

Hiçbir yasal işlem için bana ihtiyaç olduğunu düşünmüyorum işlemler bu yüzden sonunda alex'i ve ailesini engelledim düğün iptal edildi ve ben de alex'ten banka hesapları ve benzeri konularda kendimi kurtarmaya yeni başlıyorum

işte sorunum marcus'a karşı çok öfkeliyim sanki beni gerçekten umursamıyormuş gibi hissediyorum bana dani'nin söylemesini engelledi böylece tanıştığı kızla birlikte olmaya devam edebildi görünüşe göre suçlu hissediyor çünkü eğer ayrılsalardı dani saldırıya uğramayacaktı bana alex'in o sabah beni aldattığını söyleme nezaketini göstermedi tıpkı diğer iki karısına yaptığı gibi duygularımı korumuş gibi değil çünkü eski sevgilimin başka bir kadına saldırması duymak çok kötü bir şeydi bana saldırının tam boyutunu söylemedi dani alex'in sadece sırasını beklediğinden mi yoksa tek yapacağı izlemek miydi emin değil bana bunu en kısa sürede söylemeliydim çünkü konuşma onun için inanılmaz derecede zordu daniel eskortlar hakkında hiçbir şey bilmiyordu ve marcus içeri girdiklerinde gördüklerinin tam hikayesini paylaşmadı daniel benim kayam oldu biraz perspektife ihtiyacım var burada öfkelenmek sorun değil mi marcus yersiz bir öfke mi ama alex'e oldukça kızgınım ve ona karşı hissettiğim tek şey bu bana farklı bir bakış açısı verebilir mi marcus'u özlüyorum ve sürekli iletişim halindeydim zaten işe geri döndü bu yüzden mesajlar, mesajlar ve ara sıra aramalar oldu aslında dün gece ziyaret etti ama ona kapıyı açmadım daniel ne hissediyorsam onu ​​söylüyor şu an sorun değil ama sanırım beni yatıştırmaya çalışıyor artık kime güveneceğimi bilmiyorum

alex ile daha fazla iletişim kurmak zorunda değilim ve davanın bensiz ilerleyeceğini düşünüyorum daniel'e ondan, marcus'tan ve o arkadaş grubundan bir mola vermem gerektiğini söylemeyi düşünüyorum dani ve ben iletişimde kalacağız dedik ama aramızda çok yakın bir ilişki göremiyorum sonunda güvendiğim en iyi arkadaşım artık hepsinden tamamen uzaklaşmam ve ilerlemeye çalışmam gerektiğini düşünüyor ailem de aynı fikirde ve iyileşmek için bunun gerekli olduğunu düşünüyor kardeşim daniel'in harika biri olduğunu ve onu hayatımdan çıkarmamam gerektiğini düşünüyor ama hepsi bir paket anlaşma gibi görünüyor ama alex olmadan artık belli ki bu yüzden muhtemelen ya hep ya hiç ne yapmalıyım olmak istemiyorum nankör ama temiz bir kopuş doğru hissettiriyor"
"I know the title is really jarring, but let me give some context. My family is selling our home that has been with us ever since my great grandparents built it when they came to America. We unfortunately have to as to pay my grandmothers retirement home. Anyway, this house has a lot of old things inside and when cleaning it out, you can imagine my shock to find a whole n*zi flag folded up in a basement cabinet. Not only that, there’s also an ornate dagger made of brass and I think ivory with a swastika at the hilt. Supposedly, the story goes that according to my grandmother, her late husband, my grandfather, brought them along with some bayonet’s home as souvenirs when he was deployed in Germany. He was in an army division that helped during the rebuilding phase in the 50s, and any soldier could bring anything they found home with them.

My question is, what do I do with these artifacts? On the one hand, I could always burn them. On the other hand, I’d like them to be used for educational purposes, to teach others about one of the worst periods in human history as to not repeat it. Help me out Reddit!

Edit 1: My mistake, it’s Brass and Ivory, not gold. I’m dumb.

Update 1: Thank you all for your suggestions and feedback. I’m going to get every detail about where they came from and how my grandfather got them. After that, I’ll start contacting museums, starting with ones closest to me and work from there.

Update 1.5: And for those asking why I would burn these, it was just a suggestion I got from a family member. I was just relaying an option I was told of.

Final Update: Hey all, sorry I never got back to this. Life has been crazy and I almost forgot about making a post about this situation. Anyway, the ending to this was simple. I asked every relative one by one, either thru phone or email about these artifacts and if they wanted them. In the end, my aunt, aka my grandfathers daughter changed her mind and decided to take them with her. The objects are in her possession now. ","Başlığın gerçekten sarsıcı olduğunu biliyorum ama biraz bağlam vereyim, ailem büyük büyükbabam ve büyükannem Amerika'ya geldiklerinde inşa ettiklerinden beri bizimle olan evimizi satıyor, ne yazık ki büyükannemin emeklilik evini ödemek zorundayız, bu evin içinde çok sayıda eski eşya var ve temizlerken bodrum dolabında katlanmış bir NZI bayrağı bulduğumdaki şokumu hayal edebilirsiniz, sadece bu değil, ayrıca pirinçten yapılmış süslü bir hançer ve sanırım sapında bir gamalı haç var, hikayeye göre büyükanneme göre merhum kocası büyükbabam Almanya'ya konuşlandırıldığında hatıra olarak süngülerle birlikte bunları eve getirmiş, s'lerde yeniden inşa aşamasında yardım eden bir ordu tümenindeydi ve herhangi bir asker buldukları her şeyi eve getirebilirdi

sorum şu, bu eserlerle ne yapacağım bir yandan onları her zaman yakabilirim diğer yandan insanlık tarihinin en kötü dönemlerinden birini başkalarına öğretmek için eğitim amaçlı kullanılmasını istiyorum, böylece tekrarlanmaması için bana yardım et reddit

"Long story short, I had to travel abroad for 65 days for some business. I live in a small, clean studio apartment. I have never had any issues with insects, ants, or flies. I live on the 4th floor of the building. Before I left the apartment, I made sure to empty my fridge and to throw out the trash, but I somehow managed to forget a chicken sandwich (that was wrapped in 2 plastic bags) that I was planning on eating at the airport on my wooden dining table. I only realized this after I arrived at my destination. I will be returning to my apartment after tomorrow, and I'm genuinely terrified as my apartment is so small, and I'm scared of the scent waiting for me there, I'm also worried that my apartment will become infested with cockroaches and other pests. The apartment is well sealed with all the windows closed and the lights turned off

Am I thinking too much about this? Is the situation as serious as I think, or is it just going to be a minor inconvenience?

I would love to get some advice on what to do once I arrive at the apartment! 

Edit 1: by popular demand, I will be updating this post when I return to my apartment. I'm not sure if I will be taking a picture of the sandwich because I wouldn't want to open that plastic bag but I may just do it for you guys LOL!

Update : I made back to my apartment about one hour ago!!!!

A taxi dropped me right in front of the building. I took a deep breath and made my way to the 4th floor. Once I was on the 4th floor, I started sniffing around for any unpleasant smell, and there was none, which was a good sign UNTIL I saw a moth on my apartment door. I wore my gloves and face mask, got my plastic bag and sanitizer ready, and proceeded to open the door! 

I entered the apartment, and there was no scent AT ALL. I dropped my face mask and started sniffing around, but nope, There was no scent. I made my way to my dining table, and there it was; the bag was intact, and there was no spilling of any weird liquid, nor can I see any insects/pests. I opened the windows just in case and then proceeded to open the bag (SStupid I KNOW), I was struck by the most disgusting scent that I have ever smelt. I looked into the bag and saw what I could only call an abomination! I won't even try to describe what I saw; here is a picture(https://imgur.com/gallery/khQ1YDn). I tried to turn that thing around to get a better picture, but the smell was too much for me to handle. At this point, I started gagging, and my eyes were tearing up. I took the plastic bag and threw it in an even larger bag and took it to one of those large trash bins that we have in the street


Edit 2: Here is a second picture that I took right next to the trash bin in our street (https://imgur.com/gallery/1hFAAx9). I do realize that those pics may disappoint some of you guys, but trust me, the smell was so bad I couldn't hold my phone straight. 


Also, I noticed a horde of small dead flies next to my stove when I returned back to the apartment. Not sure where they came from, tbh, but they are dead, so no big deal. Other than that, there isn't anything else to report. I would also like to take a moment to thank everyone for their advice on how to handle the situation and what to expect. I have definitely learned my lesson this time, and I will always make sure to leave a spare key behind just in case. 


unrelated but had to be shared: our plane was about to land on the runway, and the plane wheels even made contact with the runway, but the pilot decided to abort landing and took off! We spent the next 15 minutes in the air just circling the city before the pilot attempted to land again. This time he aced it, and everyone started clapping and cheering LOL.","uzun lafın kısası, bazı işler için günlerce yurtdışına seyahat etmek zorunda kaldım, küçük ve temiz bir stüdyo dairede yaşıyorum, böcekler, karıncalar veya sineklerle ilgili hiçbir sorun yaşamadım, binanın 3. katında yaşıyorum, daireden ayrılmadan önce buzdolabımı boşalttığımdan ve çöpleri attığımdan emin oldum ama bir şekilde havaalanında ahşap yemek masamda yemeyi planladığım plastik poşetlere sarılı bir tavuk sandviçini yemeyi unuttum, bunu ancak varış yerime vardığımda fark ettim, yarından sonra daireme döneceğim ve dairem çok küçük olduğu için gerçekten korkuyorum ve orada beni bekleyen kokudan korkuyorum, ayrıca dairemin hamamböcekleri ve diğer zararlılarla istila edilmesinden endişeleniyorum, daire iyi kapatılmış, tüm pencereler kapalı ve ışıklar sönük

bunun hakkında çok fazla mı düşünüyorum, durum düşündüğüm kadar ciddi mi yoksa sadece küçük bir rahatsızlık mı olacak

daireye vardığımda ne yapacağım konusunda biraz tavsiye almak isterim

popüler talep üzerine düzenlendi, daireme döndüğümde bu gönderiyi güncelleyeceğim, alıp almayacağımdan emin değilim sandviçin bir resmi çünkü o plastik poşeti açmak istemezdim ama sizin için yapabilirim lol

yaklaşık bir saat önce daireme geri döndüğümde yaptığım güncelleme

bir taksi beni binanın tam önünde bıraktı derin bir nefes aldım ve 3. kata çıktım 3. kata çıktığımda herhangi bir kötü koku olup olmadığını koklamaya başladım ve hiç yoktu bu iyi bir işaretti ta ki dairemin kapısında bir güve görene kadar eldivenlerimi ve yüz maskemi taktım plastik poşetimi ve dezenfektanımı hazırladım ve kapıyı açmaya başladım

daireye girdim ve hiç koku yoktu yüz maskemi düşürdüm ve etrafı koklamaya başladım ama hayır koku yoktu yemek masama doğru ilerledim ve oradaydı poşet sağlamdı ve herhangi bir garip sıvı dökülmemişti ve herhangi bir böcek haşere göremiyordum her ihtimale karşı pencereleri açtım ve sonra poşeti açmaya başladım aptal biliyorum şimdiye kadar kokladığım en iğrenç kokuyla karşılaştım poşete baktım ve ancak iğrenç diyebileceğim bir şey gördüm burada gördüğümü tarif etmeye bile çalışmayacağım bir resim httpsimgurcomgallerykhqydn daha iyi bir resim elde etmek için o şeyi çevirmeye çalıştım ama koku benim için çok fazlaydı bu noktada kusuyordum ve gözlerim yaşardı plastik poşeti alıp daha büyük bir poşete attım ve sokakta bulunan büyük çöp kutularından birine götürdüm

düzenleme burada sokaktaki çöp kutusunun hemen yanında çektiğim ikinci bir resim httpsimgurcomgalleryhfaax bu resimlerin bazılarını hayal kırıklığına uğratabileceğini biliyorum ama inanın bana koku o kadar kötüydü ki telefonumu düzgün tutamadım

ayrıca daireye geri döndüğümde ocağımın yanında bir sürü küçük ölü sinek gördüm nereden geldiklerinden emin değilim ama ölmüşler yani bunun dışında bildirilecek başka bir şey yok ayrıca herkese durumla nasıl başa çıkılacağı ve ne beklenmesi gerektiği konusunda verdikleri tavsiyeler için teşekkür etmek istiyorum bu sefer kesinlikle dersimi aldım ve her zaman yedek bir anahtar bıraktığımdan emin olacağım eğer 

ilgisiz ama paylaşılması gerekiyordu uçağımız piste inmek üzereydi ve uçağın tekerlekleri piste temas etti ama pilot inişi iptal etmeye karar verdi ve havalandı pilot tekrar inmeye çalışana kadar sonraki dakikaları havada sadece şehri turlayarak geçirdik bu sefer başardı ve herkes alkışlamaya ve tezahürat etmeye başladı lol"
"My husband and I have been married for 7 years. We have a three year old together. My parents have always been against our relationship because he is blind and black. I wanted to go no contact with them many times, but my husband always said family is important even if they don't accept him.
Before the incident, we announced that we are expecting another baby. My parents were very cruel, they said that if I loved and appreciate them  I should get an abortion, that they never loved my three year old and many other very hurtful things. My father started cursing my husband, and that's when my husband started cursing him too, as well as my grandmother who was also with my father at the time. We dont live in the same city, everything I said so far happened over the phone.

The  next day after the phone call, both my parents came though my door, started beating my husband, screaming how dare he curse them and my grandmother. My father slapped, chocked and pushed me in a wall for ""allowing my husband to call them"", showed me his gun license, threatened to kill my husband and took away my phones when he saw I was trying to call for help. I managed to call my sister in law before he took the last one. She answered and came very fast with her brothes (they all live like 10 min from our house) and my parents actually RAN from the scene of the crime. 

If they wouldn't have shown up, my husband would certanly be dead. And my three year old witnessed the whole thing and was accidentaly hurt in the mouth by my father as well. 

We have been to the hospital and to the police. My husband is very beaten, thankfully not hospitalised. My pregnancy is fine, no damages. We are pressing charges and they will most certainly go to jail. They tried to destroy my family, but I have this guilt about sending my own parents to jail . I love my husband very much, but they raised me, even if they are very bad people. What should I be feeling? Am I doing the right thing?

Edit: Thank you all for your kind words, I needed them. From what we know so far, they are denying everything that happened. We are going all the way with this, we have all the proof. I was in shock, I couldn't believe anyone would have the heart to do such a thing, let alone my own parents. I need to protect my actual family, my husband and my children. Thank you all for the encourangement. Be safe..","kocam ve ben yıllardır evliyiz, üç yaşında bir çocuğumuz var, ailem kör ve siyah olduğu için ilişkimize her zaman karşı çıktı, onlarla birçok kez hiç iletişim kurmamak istedim ama kocam her zaman ailenin önemli olduğunu söyledi, onu kabul etmeseler bile
olaydan önce başka bir bebek beklediğimizi duyurduk, ailem çok zalimdi, eğer onları seviyor ve takdir ediyorsam kürtaj yaptırmam gerektiğini söylediler, üç yaşındaki çocuğumu hiç sevmediler ve daha birçok çok incitici şey yaptılar, babam kocama küfür etmeye başladı ve o zaman kocam da ona küfür etmeye başladı, o sırada babamla birlikte olan büyükannem de aynı şehirde yaşamıyoruz, şu ana kadar söylediğim her şey telefonda oldu

telefon görüşmesinden sonraki gün, her iki ebeveynim de geldi, kapımı dövmeye başladılar, kocam çığlık atıyordu, nasıl onlara küfür ederdi ve büyükannem, babam kocamın onları aramasına izin verdiğim için beni tokatladı, boğdu ve duvara itti, bana silah ruhsatını gösterdi, kocamı öldürmekle tehdit etti ve yardım çağırmaya çalıştığımı görünce telefonlarımı aldı, kayınvalidemi aramayı başardım, o da almadan önce sonuncusu cevapladı ve çok hızlı geldi, erkek kardeşleriyle birlikte, hepsi evimizden çok uzakta yaşıyorlar ve ailem suç mahallinden kaçtı

eğer gelmeselerdi, kocam kesinlikle ölmüş olurdu ve üç yaşındaki çocuğum tüm olanlara tanık oldu ve babam tarafından yanlışlıkla ağzından yaralandı

hastaneye ve polise gittik, kocam çok dövüldü, şükürler olsun ki hastaneye yatırılmadı, hamileliğim iyi gidiyor, zarar yok, dava açıyoruz ve kesinlikle hapse girecekler, ailemi mahvetmeye çalıştılar ama kendi ailemi hapse gönderdiğim için suçluluk duyuyorum, kocamı çok seviyorum ama beni onlar büyüttü, çok kötü insanlar olsalar bile, ne hissetmeliyim, doğru şeyi mi yapıyorum

düzenleme, nazik sözleriniz için hepinize teşekkür ederim, şu ana kadar bildiğimiz kadarıyla onlara ihtiyacım vardı, olan her şeyi inkar ediyorlar, bununla sonuna kadar gidiyoruz, tüm kanıtlarımız var, şoktaydım, böyle bir şeyi yapmaya kimsenin gönlü razı olmazdı, kendi ailemi bırakın, gerçek ailemi, kocamı ve çocuklarımı korumam gerekiyor, hepinize teşekkür ederim, cesaretlendirme güvende ol"
"Words probably no one wants to hear about their loved ones. I get a call from her trying to tell me to keep calm and saying that she was slapped in the face from her boss for doing ""something stupid"". No matter the reason, she shouldn't be slapped across the face for that. She works in the fast food industry, and not many people can be trusted there. Regardless, I need to know what she can do to get her boss fired or reprimanded. I would be lying if I said that's all she deserves. Any advice would be appreciated.

She has contacted a supposed higher up manager about the issue and he only said he would ""deal with it."" I can't trust that phrase when it comes to something like this.

EDIT: Thank you all for your help. She's still shaken up from it as it happened earlier today, but is planning to leave the company ASAP as well as pursue legal action when she's more emotionally in check tomorrow.","Muhtemelen hiç kimse sevdikleri hakkında duymak istemeyeceği sözler, beni arayıp sakin olmamı ve patronunun yaptığı aptalca bir şey yüzünden tokat attığını, bunun sebebi ne olursa olsun tokatlanmaması gerektiğini söylüyor, fast food sektöründe çalışıyor ve orada pek çok insana güvenilemez, patronunun kovulması veya azarlanması için ne yapabileceğini bilmem gerekiyor, bunun hak ettiği tek şey olduğunu söylersem yalan söylemiş olurum, her türlü tavsiye takdir edilir

konuyla ilgili olarak sözde daha üst düzey bir yöneticiyle iletişime geçti ve sadece bununla ilgileneceğini söyledi, böyle bir şey söz konusu olduğunda bu ifadeye güvenemiyorum

düzenleme yardımınız için hepinize teşekkür ederim, bugün erken saatlerde olduğu için hala sarsılmış durumda ancak yarın duygusal olarak daha iyi olduğunda yasal işlem başlatmayı ve en kısa sürede şirketten ayrılmayı planlıyor"
"I 19 F and am an international student in Tokyo Japan,, I don't use Reddit but I really just don't know what to do. Last night I went out on a date with guy I met online. I know I maybe shouldn't have done that in the first place but I just wanted to try it since I grew up pretty sheltered and I'm now living on my own. I was fine with sex but with protection of course and I sent my location to multiple friends so I thought it would've been fine. The date itself was nice and fun, but then when we went back to his place and then things heated up he was insisting on doing it without a condom even when I said I didn't want to do it without one but he said he gets regular blood tests and would give me an after pill and I just didn't know how to say no because we took his car and I was far from my dorm and he's a little older too so I didnt know what he would do if I did anything else so I ended up giving in. 

He did cum inside and he did give me levonestrel which I took with water immediately after. The thing is, I'm around 86kg and 154cm. I researched that ECs have weight limits????? I have no idea so I've just been genuinely so scared. I also took cyproterone acetate ethinylestradiol which I brought from home since I have PCOS. And I'm also worried about my PCOS affecting the ECs effectiveness. 

In japan abortions and  after pills require a lot of money and prescriptions which I don't have and I don't even know if i am pregnant. I'm just honestly still so shaken up. I'm glad I'm safe but I'm still way too scared and don't know what to do. If this is the wrong place to ask I'm so sorry I don't use Reddit but if there's another place I can ask for help I'd also appreciate that. 






UPDATE/EDIT: thank you for everyone’s advice,,, I only decided to walk around and do errands today to clear my head (which,, mentally I’m still going up and down) 

I checked my university’s health support site and it doesn’t say anything about women’s health but I’ll be consulting anyways if I can get an appointment. I’m still looking for clinics I can book an appointment with in case my university doesn’t cater to this and all,, I can’t go directly to a hospital as there are fees for that if you aren’t referred from a smaller private clinic here in japan. 

I understand that I should’ve just not gone to his place or even the date to begin with especially considering the age gap,, it was stupid and I was in a bad headspace when I agreed on the date,, which shouldn’t have been an excuse. I wasn’t a virgin before this (having don’t it twice with protection and getting tested in my home country prior) hence I was fine with the kissing and I assumed he was gonna be okay with the condoms as I saw he had some in the livingroom where he fucked me. He also had kids so I assumed too that he wouldn’t be doing it raw with me. 

He was much older and I had said no explicitly saying I don’t want to without the condom in Japanese but he kept pushing for it and like I mentioned— I was far from my dorm and he was kind of intimidating so I said yes since I was concerned he was gonna get violent. 

I’m so so grateful for everyone’s advice and the messages I’ve gotten too. I’ve learned a lot and will be doing what I can especially getting tested. 

UPDATE: im gonna be honest there were times the past tree weeks where I was insanely scared and stressed but then I started socializing more and it’s made me less stressed and I took the pregnancy tests they came out negative. I also just got my period I think so im really grateful. I can’t afford an std test with my allowance now but I seem alright. Thank you again for everyone’s help and advice especially at a time when I was really mentally low.","ben ve tokyo japonya'da uluslararası bir öğrenciyim reddit kullanmıyorum ama gerçekten ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum dün gece internette tanıştığım bir adamla buluşmaya çıktım biliyorum belki de ilk başta bunu yapmamalıydım ama sadece denemek istedim çünkü oldukça korunaklı büyüdüm ve şimdi tek başıma yaşıyorum seks konusunda iyiydim ama tabii ki korunarak ve konumumu birçok arkadaşıma gönderdim bu yüzden sorun olmayacağını düşündüm buluşmanın kendisi güzel ve eğlenceliydi ama sonra onun evine geri döndüğümüzde ve işler kızıştığında prezervatifsiz yapmakta ısrar ediyordu prezervatifsiz yapmak istemediğimi söylememe rağmen düzenli kan testleri yaptırdığını ve bana bir hap vereceğini söyledi ve ben sadece hayır demeyi bilmiyordum çünkü arabasını aldık ve yurdumdan uzaktaydım ve o da biraz daha büyük bu yüzden başka bir şey yaparsam ne yapacağını bilmiyordum bu yüzden sonunda pes ettim

içime boşaldı ve bana levonestrel verdi, hemen ardından suyla aldım şey şu ki kilom ve cm'im ecs'nin kilo sınırlamaları olduğunu araştırdım hiçbir fikrim yok bu yüzden gerçekten çok korktum ayrıca evden getirdiğim siproteron asetat etinilestradiol aldım çünkü pcos'um var ve pcos'umun ecs'nin etkinliğini etkilemesinden endişeleniyorum

japonya'da kürtaj ve doğum kontrol hapları çok para ve reçete gerektiriyor ki bende yok ve hamile olup olmadığımı bile bilmiyorum dürüst olmak gerekirse hala çok sarsıldım güvende olduğuma sevindim ama hala çok korkuyorum ve eğer sormak için yanlış yerse ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum çok üzgünüm reddit kullanmıyorum ama yardım isteyebileceğim başka bir yer varsa bunu da takdir ederim

güncellemedüzenle herkesin tavsiyesi için teşekkür ederim bugün sadece kafamı boşaltmak için dolaşmaya ve ufak tefek işler yapmaya karar verdim ki zihinsel olarak hala inişli çıkışlıyım

üniversitemin sağlık destek sitesine baktım ve kadın sağlığı hakkında hiçbir şey yazmıyordu ama yine de danışacağım eğer randevu alabilirsem üniversitem buna ve diğerlerine uygun değilse randevu alabileceğim klinikler arıyorum Japonya'daki daha küçük bir özel klinikten sevk edilmezseniz bunun için ücretler olduğu için doğrudan hastaneye gidemem

Anladığım kadarıyla, özellikle yaş farkını göz önünde bulundurarak, onun evine veya randevuya gitmemeliydim, aptalcaydı ve randevuda anlaştığımız zaman kötü bir ruh halindeydim, bu bir bahane olmamalıydı, daha önce bakire değildim, iki kez korumayla ve daha önce kendi ülkemde test yaptırmıştım, bu yüzden öpüşmekten memnundum ve prezervatifle sorun yaşamayacağını varsaydım çünkü oturma odasında beni becerdiği yerde prezervatif olduğunu gördüm, ayrıca çocukları da vardı, bu yüzden benimle çıplak bir ilişki yaşamayacağını varsaydım

Çok daha büyüktü ve prezervatif olmadan istemediğimi açıkça söyleyerek Japonca hayır demiştim ama o ısrar etmeye devam etti ve bahsettiğim gibi yurdumdan çok uzaktaydım ve biraz korkutucuydu, bu yüzden şiddete başvuracağından endişe ettiğim için evet dedim

Herkesin tavsiyesi ve aldığım mesajlar için çok minnettarım, çok şey öğrendim ve özellikle elimden geleni yapacağım test yaptırıyorum

güncelleme dürüst olacağım, geçen üç haftada inanılmaz korktuğum ve strese girdiğim zamanlar oldu ama sonra daha fazla sosyalleşmeye başladım ve bu beni daha az stresli hale getirdi ve hamilelik testleri yaptırdım, negatif çıktılar ayrıca sanırım adetim de oldu bu yüzden çok minnettarım, şu an harçlığımla cinsel yolla bulaşan hastalık testi yaptıramıyorum ama iyi görünüyorum özellikle de zihinsel olarak çok kötü olduğum bir zamanda herkesin yardımı ve tavsiyesi için tekrar teşekkür ederim"

"(The 18-year-old female is me btw)  


Is it normal for me to just see people and if I find them a tiniest bit attractive, I imagine what it would be like to have sex with them? Like if I were to cross the road and see a person that I find a tiny bit cute, my mind would immediately imagine me and them having sex even though we literally have non interacted even once. This is usually why I keep my head down sometimes when I walk (but that's pretty dangerous so I don't always look down on the floor ofc). Another scenario would be if I were in an elevator and the same thing happens; either 1 person in the elevator or even if I'm in an elevator and I'm the only girl, I would think about certain scenarios happening. 

Ever since I was little I would also imagine people naked because of cartoons saying ""If you're scared, then just imagine everyone in their underwear/naked""

Though the thing is, I am a virgin and never really had any intimate relationships before, I also don't actively search out to watch porn or read any romance books. 

I tried asking my friend, but most of my friends in the friend group are ace, so when I tried describing the situation they would feel grossed out, which made me quite insecure and think that it wasn't normal which leads me to here.","bu arada yaşındaki kadın benim

sadece insanları görmem ve onları biraz çekici bulursam onlarla seks yapmanın nasıl bir şey olacağını hayal etmem normal mi? yolun karşısına geçtiğimde biraz sevimli bulduğum birini görsem, aklım hemen beni ve onları seks yaparken hayal ederdi, kelimenin tam anlamıyla bir kez bile etkileşime girmemiş olsak bile, bu genellikle yürürken bazen başımı öne eğmemin nedenidir, ancak bu oldukça tehlikelidir, bu yüzden her zaman yere bakmam. bir diğer senaryo da asansörde olsaydım ve aynı şey asansördeki kişi veya asansörde tek kız olsam bile, belirli senaryoların olacağını düşünürdüm

"I invited my vegan friend and her partner over for dinner.  I went through all the ingredients to make that everything was in fact vegan, because I wasn’t trying to be a jerk and feed her non vegan things.  One of the ingredients in the recipe I was making was red wine, so of course I made sure it was vegan.  She and her partner brought a bottle of wine (they don’t live together and I don’t know who bought it), but I didn’t think twice about it and just served it because I assumed I was vegan.  Everyone drank it.  Afterwards when I was putting the bottle in the recycling I noticed that it didn’t say it was vegan on it, so I googled it and it looks like it wasn’t.  I know it isn’t my fault, but do I tell her?  I’m kind of wondering if she is aware that most wine isn’t vegan? Or do I just shut my mouth because I’m not trying to start stuff if her partner is the one that purchased it? Also I know she is a strict vegan and doesn’t consume anything with any kind of animal products from previous conversations.

Update: I brought it up and she said she is aware.  She said she normally doesn’t drink beer and wine, but when she does she doesn’t usually check.  ","vegan arkadaşımı ve eşini akşam yemeğine davet ettim, her şeyin gerçekten vegan olduğundan emin olmak için tüm malzemeleri tek tek inceledim çünkü ona vegan olmayan şeyler yedirmeye çalışmıyordum, yaptığım tarifteki malzemelerden biri kırmızı şaraptı, bu yüzden vegan olduğundan emin oldum, o ve eşi bir şişe şarap getirdi, birlikte yaşamıyorlar ve kimin aldığını bilmiyorum ama hiç düşünmedim ve sadece servis ettim çünkü vegan olduğumu varsaymıştım, herkes içti, şişeyi geri dönüşüme koyarken üzerinde vegan yazmadığını fark ettim, bu yüzden Google'da aradım ve öyle görünmüyordu, bunun benim hatam olmadığını biliyorum ama ona şarabın çoğunun vegan olmadığının farkında olup olmadığını mı söylemeliyim yoksa sadece ağzımı mı kapatmalıyım çünkü bir şey başlatmaya çalışmıyorum, eğer eşi satın alan kişiyse ayrıca sıkı bir vegan olduğunu ve önceki konuşmalardan hiçbir hayvansal ürün tüketmediğini biliyorum

"I am a teenager (M)17 and my brother is 15.

Since we were kids, I’ve watched my parents spoil my brother endlessly. He gets everything...branded clothes, the latest iPhones, shoes, and even large amounts of money. I’m not jealous, I feel loved by my parents and appreciate that I’m not neglected. But what bothers me is how they always let him off the hook, no matter what he does. He once broke our TV when they refused to buy him a computer, punched a kid who wouldn’t let him borrow their bike, and even smashed my dad’s car mirror because he wasn’t allowed to drive it because he was just 11 years old.

Now back to the moment I punched him.

I was washing dishes in the kitchen while my mom worked on her laptop in the living room. My spoiled brother came up to her, acting sweet, then asked for a VR set just a week after they bought him a PS5 for his birthday. I overheard my mom say she couldn’t get it for him, likely because of the recent gift. Suddenly, he shoved her laptop, cracking the screen, but instead of scolding him, she just picked it up. He started screaming at her, and I couldn’t take it anymore. Years of frustration boiled over. As he tried to storm off to our room, I blocked his way and punched him in the face. I haven't gotten into a fight and It was my first time hitting anyone, It was just unfortunate that it had to be my own brother, and though I felt some satisfaction seeing him on the floor holding his bleeding nose, guilt quickly took over. My mom saw everything and started crying, which made me feel even worse. Now I’m stuck, regretting what I did, especially since my dad is furious and on his way home. I love my brother, but I can’t shake the feeling that he deserved it. I really need advice because I regret punching him.

"My great-aunt disappeared in the 90s. I wasn't around, but my father's mentioned it and my grandmother has mentioned it. Everyone basically seemed to say that she just picked up and left (she hadn't been close with her siblings and she didn't have children).

I've been doing some family research, and I found her name, so I Googled it. Then I Googled her with a different surname that I had seen on one of the documents that I'd found. 

Apparently, she had been decapitated and mutilated. 

Her body hadn't been identified until the 2000s, so I'm not sure whether my family knew and were trying to make a happy ending or whether they genuinely never found out what had happened. Even though it's available online, my parents and their family are fairly technologically incompetent. 

So what do I do?

"It's getting really annoying with my friend. We've been close since we were 4 years old, but now all she does is go on and on about Black guys and how she's hooking up with a new one like every 3 days. She even tried messing around with my cousin. She's this blonde-haired, blue-eyed Swedish and she says with her phenotype her kids will have the ultimate mix or something. She calls herself a 'snowbunny' and doesn't care when I tell her that's a disrespectful thing to call herself.

Look, I respect her preferences, I'm usually into Black dudes myself. But one time when I was dating this white guy, she would not shut up about how Black men are so much better - talking about how white guys lack dominance and masculinity right in front of him. He couldn't stand her, said her presence was straight up annoying. He ended up breaking up with me unless I stopped hanging out with her crazy ass. I chose the 12-year friendship over him because I can't just ditch her like that.

But then I had to have a talk with her about how fetishizing Black guys is weird and she needs to chill. She flipped it and accused me of being jealous that Black men prefer white girls over 'undesirable' Black girls. That crossed a line. I have no idea how to deal with this now.","Arkadaşımla aramızda yıllar önce yakınlık vardı ama şimdi tek yaptığı siyah adamlar hakkında konuşmak ve her gün yeni biriyle takıldığını söylemek, hatta kuzenimle bile takılmaya çalıştı, sarışın saçlı, mavi gözlü bir İsveçli ve fenotipi ile çocuklarının en iyi karışıma sahip olacağını söylüyor, kendine kar tavşanı diyor ve kendisine böyle hitap etmenin saygısızca olduğunu söylediğimde umursamıyor

ama sonra onunla siyah adamları fetişleştirmenin tuhaf olduğunu ve sakinleşmesi gerektiğini konuşmak zorunda kaldım, her şeyi tersine çevirdi ve beni siyah erkeklerin istenmeyen siyah kızlar yerine beyaz kızları tercih etmesinden dolayı kıskanç olmakla suçladı, bu bir sınırı aştı, bununla nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum"
"I (36F) have struggled to be patient with my FIL’s wife (51F). We'll call her ""Aunt Grandma.""  
  
My husband and I have been married for 9 years. He had 2 kids with his ex-wife who disappeared (by choice) and I’ve since raised them as my own. When they were together my FIL met and married the ex-wife’s sister, hence, ""Aunt Grandma.""  
  
Aunt Grandma has always disliked me. Before I met most of the family I was on a ventilator for a while. I was in a medically induced coma so I don't remember it, but many of my in-laws came to the hospital. I think that’s where it started.  
  
(A few YEARS prior to this Aunt Grandma had surgery and I think she feels I stole her ""spotlight."" As if I can control being on LIFE SUPPORT!)  
  
Since I’ve known her, Aunt Grandma has gone out of her way to be “disrespected.” This is a widespread issue with EVERYONE!  
  
Some examples: I was “disrespectful” when I didn’t call to wish her a Happy Mother's Day. I’ve lost both my mother and a child. I don't celebrate it. She knows this.  
  
She was recently ""hurt"" when another family member had surgery and people called to check on them, but nobody checked on her. (Why would they?) Hell, I had major surgery last month and Aunt Grandma didn’t so much as text me.  
  
I don't care, just pointing out the hypocrisy.  
  
A big one is I have a severe shrimp allergy. If I’m near it, it’s a ""grab the epi-pen, call 911, and hope they drive fast"" scenario. For years Aunt Grandma would host Christmas dinner and ""forget.” (Yes, she made shrimp every year.) In 2019 I reminded her and to my surprise she didn’t cook shrimp…but I still had a reaction. I was confused as I broke out in hives and struggled to breathe. She said, ""I don't know what it is, it must be in your head."" That’s when I saw she had snuck in a pot of shrimp gumbo. We have not returned since and it’s “disrespectful” of me to not attend.  
  
NOW TO THIS THANKSGIVING!  
  
I guess Aunt Grandma just wanted to leave so she claimed I complained about her food. (I didn’t.) This lead to my FIL, with whom I’ve never had an issue, screaming at me in front of 30 or so in-laws, ""YOU ARE NOT PART OF THIS FAMILY! YOU WILL NOT DISRESPECT MY WIFE! YOU'RE NOT SPECIAL! YOU THINK YOU'RE SPECIAL BUT YOU'RE NOT!""  
  
My husband jumped in and shut that dooown! They quickly realized EVERYBODY was upset with them and left.  
  
My husband and FIL are very close. They talk on the phone for at LEAST and hour everyday, but haven’t spoken since Thanksgiving. My husband says he’s done. It’s not my fault but I don’t like the idea of my husband cutting ties in my defense. I don’t care about what my FIL said to me at this point, I’m more upset about how it is affecting my husband. In hopes of them reconciling I’ve tried my best to remain neutral.  
  
Aunt Grandma just randomly text me saying only, ""What do you want for Christmas?"" Considering she WILL share screenshots, how can I drop the truth on her in a way that won’t allow her to turn it around on me?  
  
","eğer babamın karısına karşı sabırlı olmakta zorlandıysam teyzesine büyükanne diyelim


kocamla yıllardır evliyiz eski karısından çocukları vardı ve onlar kendi isteğiyle ortadan kayboldu ve ben onları kendi çocuklarım gibi büyüttüm, onlar birlikteyken babam eski karısının kız kardeşiyle tanıştı ve evlendi, dolayısıyla teyze büyükanne 

teyze büyükanne benden hiç hoşlanmazdı, ailemin çoğuyla tanışmadan önce bir süre ventilatördeydim, tıbbi olarak indüklenen bir komadaydım, bu yüzden hatırlamıyorum ama kayınvalidelerimin çoğu hastaneye geldi, sanırım orada başladı

bundan birkaç yıl önce teyze büyükanne ameliyat oldu ve sanırım sanki yaşam destek ünitesinde olmayı kontrol edebilirmişim gibi onun ilgi odağını çaldığımı düşünüyor

teyze büyükannesini tanıdığımdan beri saygısızlık görmek için elinden geleni yapıyor, bu herkeste yaygın bir sorun

bazı örnekler ona mutlu anneler günü dilemek için aramadığımda saygısızlık ettim hem annemi hem de bir çocuğumu kaybettim bunu kutlamıyorum bunu o da biliyor


geçtiğimiz günlerde başka bir aile üyesinin ameliyatı olduğunda incinmişti ve insanlar onları kontrol etmek için aradılar ama kimse onu kontrol etmedi neden cehenneme gitsinler ki geçen ay büyük bir ameliyat geçirdim ve teyzem büyükanne bana mesaj bile atmadı


umursamıyorum sadece ikiyüzlülüğe işaret ediyorum

en önemlisi şiddetli karides alerjim var eğer yakınımda olursa epipen'i alıp hızlı gitmelerini ummak yıllardır senaryo teyzem büyükanne Noel yemeği verir ve unuturdu evet her yıl karides yapardı ona hatırlattım ve şaşırtıcı bir şekilde karides pişirmedi ama yine de bir tepki verdim kurdeşen döktüğüm ve nefes almakta zorlandığım için kafam karışmıştı ne olduğunu bilmiyorum kafanın içinde olmalı dedi o zaman bir tencere karides gumbo'sunu gizlice koyduğunu gördüm o zamandan beri geri dönmedik ve katılmamam saygısızlık

şimdi şükran gününe

sanırım teyzem büyükanne sadece ayrılmak istedi bu yüzden şikayet ettiğimi iddia etti onun yemeği benim kayınvalidemle hiç sorun yaşamadığım kayınvalidemle bana bağırıp durmasına yol açmadı kayınvalidemlerin önünde sen bu ailenin bir parçası değilsin karıma saygısızlık etmeyeceksin sen özel değilsin kendini özel sanıyorsun ama değilsin 

kocam atladı ve o kapıyı kapattı hemen herkesin onlara kızdığını anladılar ve gittiler 

kocam ve kayınvalidem çok yakınlar her gün en az bir saat telefonda konuşuyorlar ama şükran gününden beri konuşmuyorlar kocam yaptığını söylüyor bu benim hatam değil ama kocamın beni savunmak için bağları koparması fikrinden hoşlanmıyorum bu noktada kayınvalidemin bana ne söylediğini umursamıyorum daha çok kocamı nasıl etkilediği konusunda üzgünüm barışmaları umuduyla tarafsız kalmak için elimden geleni yaptım 

teyze büyükanne sadece bana rastgele mesaj attı sadece noel için ne istediğini söyledi ekran görüntüleri paylaşacağını düşünürsek ona gerçeği nasıl söylerim ki bana karşı ters davranmasına izin vermesin"
"Hello,

  
I am a resident of NY and have been since August 2023. I am currently living with my mom and her husband while I am waiting to hopefully reunite with my husband in Sweden, where he is a citizen. I just had the interview for my residency on May 8th and they gave no timeline as to when I could get a decision.

  
As to the issue at hand. 

  
My mom's husband is a HUGE Trump supporter. He has asked me to register to vote (which I am currently not registered) as a republican. I am a socialist to say the least and am also schizophrenic and have lots of delusions about voting here in America. The problem is that, since I live under his house, he feels it is my obligation to not only register to vote as a republican, but also to show him my ballot?! 

  
I live rent free, luckily, but feel completely violated that this man, who I barely know, is asking me to vote for Trump and the entire republican party to ""show my support"" . My mom feels I should not confront him about this as I may not have a place to live while waiting on my residency to go through. I literally may have no where to live if this guy kicks me out.  I am an only child, and my dad and his wife may be an option, but I have not talked with them yet. 

  
Are there any laws against voter fraud? I tried to find some, but google kept taking me to the NY voter registration page.  Is there anything I can say when asked by my mom's  husband to keep it civil when I tell him I don't want to register? He simply will not listen to reason, which is no surprise given who is voting for imo.

  
Thanks in advance!","merhaba

ben ny'da ikamet ediyorum ve ağustos ayından beri buradayım şu anda annem ve kocasıyla yaşıyorum. Umarım kocamla İsveç'te yeniden bir araya gelmeyi beklerken, o da vatandaş. mayıs ayında ikametgahım için görüşmeye gittim ve ne zaman karar alabileceğim konusunda bir zaman çizelgesi vermediler

konuyla ilgili olarak

annemin kocası büyük bir trump destekçisi. benden oy kaydı yaptırmamı istedi. Şu anda cumhuriyetçi olarak kayıtlı değilim. En azından sosyalistim ve ayrıca şizofrenim ve burada amerika'da oy kullanma konusunda birçok sanrıya sahibim. Sorun şu ki, evinin altında yaşadığım için sadece cumhuriyetçi olarak oy kaydı yaptırmakla kalmayıp aynı zamanda oy pusulamı ona göstermem gerektiğini düşünüyor.

Neyse ki kira ödemeden yaşıyorum ama neredeyse hiç tanımadığım bu adamın benden trump'a ve tüm cumhuriyetçi partiye desteğimi göstermek için oy vermemi istemesi beni tamamen ihlal etti. Annem, yaşayacak bir yerim olmayabileceği için bu konuda onunla yüzleşmemem gerektiğini düşünüyor. ikametgahımın tamamlanmasını beklerken, bu adam beni evden kovarsa yaşayacak yerim kalmayabilir, tek çocuğum ve babam ve karısı bir seçenek olabilir ama henüz onlarla konuşmadım

seçmen dolandırıcılığına karşı herhangi bir yasa var mı? Bir şeyler bulmaya çalıştım ama google beni sürekli ny seçmen kayıt sayfasına yönlendiriyor. Annemin kocası medeni davranmamı istediğinde söyleyebileceğim bir şey var mı? Ona kayıt olmak istemediğimi söylediğimde, kimin oy vereceğini düşündüğümde hiç şaşırtıcı olmayan bir şekilde mantığı dinlemiyor

şimdiden teşekkürler"
"**UPDATE** *I called her, told her I saw the photo, she was quiet for a while and then I calmly told her not to write me again. She has started to cry and repeatedly said that she made a mistake, that she was going to send them to a chat that she has alone for notes, that it was her ex boyfriend etc etc (I don't know her ex, but I think he is the ""best friend"" who always talks to her, I think she is not over him. Btw they are in the same city right now) I may talk to her in person when we get back to our city, for now I don't want to know anything else about her* **Thanks to everyone for your comments** 

Well I don't know how to tell this without throwing up right now. My girlfriend and I are in our 20's, it's the first relationship I've been in as I've always had low self esteem, she's a 10/10 girl for me, I never thought of having someone like this, we've been together for a few months now. Well she just sent me via WhatsApp pictures in bed naked with another guy, I haven't seen them very well because she deleted them fast, I think she doesn't know I've seen them, the guy in the picture looks like ""her best friend"" who writes to her all the time. I had a panic attack when I saw the pictures, my heart almost jumped out of my chest, I don't know what to do right now I'm in shock, for someone with little experience and little self esteem like me this has killed me.
We are in diferent cities right now for Christmas, so I cant met here now. Also she's been acting weird on whatsApp recently.","güncelleme onu aradım fotoğrafı gördüğümü söyledim bir süre sessiz kaldı sonra sakin bir şekilde bana bir daha yazmamasını söyledim ağlamaya başladı ve defalarca hata yaptığını, onları yalnız olduğu bir sohbet odasına göndereceğini, eski erkek arkadaşı olduğunu falan söyledi eski sevgilisini tanımıyorum ama sanırım onunla her zaman konuşan en iyi arkadaşı bence onu unutamadı bu arada şu anda aynı şehirdeler şehre döndüğümüzde onunla şahsen konuşabilirim şimdilik onun hakkında başka bir şey bilmek istemiyorum yorumlarınız için herkese teşekkürler

"Hi so my bf and I have been going out a few months and I’ve come to notice that his hygiene is pretty bad but he says it’s normal for men and gets mad at me everytime I ask like “why don’t you wash your feet?” He insists it’s normal for men to do. I’m a total germaphobe and very hygienic so I may be overreacting 
For example: never brushes his teeth at night. Sometimes skips in the mornings if he is running late
Doesn’t wear deodorant all that much although he is a VERY sweaty guy and we live in southern California. 
Didn’t have conditioner until I gave him some
Doesn’t wash face
No lotion (this one is more understandable)
Pees in the shower
Doesn’t wash his hands after peeing only pooping
No wet wipes 
No floss or mouth wash
His car and room is his personal trash can. It’s littered, seriously 
Doesn’t wash his feet at all he claims that by being in the shower it just trickles down
Washes his ass for maybe 2 seconds
Re wears his shirts 3-4x even if he’s sweated in them 
He smokes a pack a day 
He doesn’t drink water ever only soda and beer. Not an exaggeration. He doesn’t like the taste
Only eats McDonald’s 
Goes through 3 grams of weed a day.  
I’m not that experienced in relationships and he tells me that thjs is normal for boys to do. My last bf didn’t do this though. Idk I need some advice bc I like his personality a lot. 
How could I talk to him about this? Is this grounds for breaking up? Is this normal and healthy and do other men do that? 

TLDR my boyfriend is pretty unhealthy and unhygienic but he says it’s normal bc he’s a boy. 

EDIT: this is not a rage bait post. Also, I am really autistic and I don’t have a lot of experience with guys. There is no need to be rude. The only r reason I post thjs is bc I want to know how normal it is. Thank you for the advice I now realize I need to break up with him. ","merhaba erkek arkadaşımla birkaç aydır çıkıyoruz ve onun hijyeninin oldukça kötü olduğunu fark ettim ama bunun erkekler için normal olduğunu söylüyor ve her sorduğumda bana kızıyor, neden ayaklarını yıkamıyorsun gibi, erkeklerin bunu yapmasının normal olduğunu söylüyor, ben tam bir mikrop fobisiyim ve çok hijyenik davranıyorum, bu yüzden aşırı tepki gösteriyor olabilirim
örneğin geceleri dişlerini asla fırçalamıyor, bazen sabahları geç kalıyorsa fırçalamıyor
çok terleyen bir adam olmasına ve güney kaliforniya'da yaşamamıza rağmen çok fazla deodorant kullanmıyor
ben verene kadar saç kremi kullanmadı
yüzünü yıkamıyor
losyon kullanmıyor, bu daha anlaşılır
duşta işiyor
işedikten sonra ellerini yıkamıyor, sadece kaka yapıyor
ıslak mendil kullanmıyor
diş ipi veya ağız gargarası kullanmıyor
arabası ve odası onun kişisel çöp kutusu, ciddi anlamda çöp dolu
ayaklarını hiç yıkamıyor, duşta olduğunda bunun sadece aşağı doğru aktığını iddia ediyor
belki birkaç saniyeliğine kıçını yıkıyor
yeniden gömleklerini terlemiş olsa bile giyiyor
günde bir paket sigara içiyor
hiç su içmiyor sadece soda ve bira içiyor abartmıyorum tadını sevmiyor
sadece mcdonalds yiyor
günde gram ot tüketiyor
ilişkilerde çok deneyimli değilim ve bana erkeklerin bunu yapmasının normal olduğunu söylüyor son erkek arkadaşım bunu yapmadı ama bilmiyorum biraz tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var çünkü kişiliğini çok seviyorum
bu konuda onunla nasıl konuşabilirim bu ayrılmak için bir sebep mi bu normal ve sağlıklı mı ve diğer erkekler bunu yapıyor mu

uzun lafın kısası erkek arkadaşım oldukça sağlıksız ve hijyenik değil ama bunun normal olduğunu söylüyor çünkü o bir erkek

düzenle bu bir öfke yemi gönderisi değil ayrıca ben gerçekten otistikim ve erkeklerle fazla deneyimim yok kaba olmaya gerek yok bunu göndermemin tek nedeni bunun ne kadar normal olduğunu bilmek istemem tavsiyen için teşekkür ederim artık onunla ayrılmam gerektiğini anladım"
"We’re in our 30s. Me and some friends went out in a group of 6 to a bar. Everything is pretty normal and just having fun getting drunk ect. 

My friend H asks me to follow her. She is intoxicated, as am I. Well it was the womens bathroom. I didnt really process this until I was in the stall with H. I immediately wanted to leave and freaked out a bit. I looked under the stall to see if there was anyone else in the bathroom.

H is behind me and she took her pants down and starts pissing right infront of me. And I’m thinking what the actual fuck. Im still looking underneath the stall to see if theres anyone else in the bathroom. And placing my feet so they cant be seen. 

Then she pulls up her pants. DOESNT FLUSH. And is like, ‘Now you can do whatever you want to me.’ 

Theres no one else in there so I get out of there and just walk straight out of the bar. Didn’t say bye to anyone. Got in a taxi and went home. 

I’ve decided to not tell anyone. Just leave it alone. H just got married, last month. I was at the wedding. They had a kid. Have a house together. H’s husband seems like a decent bloke. I have nothing bad to say about him at all. He deserves better. Ive known her longer than he has. I always kind of knew what she was about throughtout the years I’ve known her. I think she always liked me but I never was into her. But something like this.. fucked up. 

My cousin is married to Hs sister so really it could really mess things up for everyone if this gets out.   We are all in a big friend / family group.

Thoughts? 

***UPDATE***

So I have to add I am not terribly close to this man (her husband). *We are more familiar faces than actual friends.* I looked through my phone and I dont even have his phone number as a contact. So lets clear that up a bit.

I called my dad for advice. and he told me best to just leave it where it is. Because in truth nothing really happened. And he explained people make mistakes. I’m going to stick with just keeping this to myself. 

Thanks for all the input though😁

"Hi guys, 

Thank you very much for your help. I am not from the US but my husband is American, I have a little issue with his side of the family I am trying to havigate politely. 

My husband has a stepbrother (A) who is married to (B). They have two kids and host big parties twice a year - Christmas and the 4th of July. They cover most of catering and everyone visiting is also expected to bring a meal.

 Their parties last two days: some people visit first day (for example, Christmas Eve), other people visit next day (Christmas day). Same idea with the 4th.

I am a pretty good cook (I went to a culinary school in the past) and do my best to make something nice. For the last 4th I made roasted salmon with vegetables, for last Christmas I made chocolate truffles with different types of chocolates (raspberry, white, milk etc) and different covers on them (cocoa, edible gold, nuts etc). 

The issue is that both times they took the food I brought with us and put it away. I never got to eat it. 

At the Christmas party my nephew even went to the pantry and got out the truffles, only for B to tell him “Oh, we are not gonna have it today, we’ll have those tomorrow”. We never got to have any of the truffles.

I gets me really annoyed. I put time, effort and money and I don’t even get to eat what I bring? I am not a free caterer for their next day party. 

Plus I work very hard and I just want guests to eat what I make and say something nice. I want my husband to be proud of me. 

I spoke to my husband, he says that solution to the problem is not put so much effort. Just grab a pound of cookies from local bakery and that’s it. They’re grown adults, they know what they’re doing and he is not their parent to teach them manners.

If they don’t let us eat stuff we bring, they don’t deserve it. 

But I am wondering maybe there’s a better solution to the issue? Maybe I could say something politely? My husband says it will only make a scandal at the party and make us look bad. 

I don’t understand how them acting that way is ok but me saying something about it is not. My husband says to let it go. 

Please advice. 
","merhaba arkadaşlar 

yardımınız için çok teşekkür ederim ben abd'li değilim ama kocam amerikalı onun ailesiyle ilgili ufak bir sorunum var nazik davranmaya çalışıyorum 

kocamın üvey kardeşi a ile evli b iki çocuğu var ve yılda iki kez büyük partiler düzenliyorlar noel ve temmuz ayları ikramların çoğunu onlar karşılıyor ve gelen herkesin yemek getirmesi bekleniyor 

partileri iki gün sürüyor bazı insanlar ilk gün ziyaret ediyor örneğin noel arifesi diğer insanlar ertesi gün ziyaret ediyor noel günü aynı fikir th için de geçerli 

ben oldukça iyi bir aşçıyım geçmişte bir mutfak okuluna gittim ve son th için güzel bir şeyler yapmak için elimden geleni yapıyorum geçen noel için sebzeli kızarmış somon yaptım farklı çikolata türleri ahududu beyaz süt vb. ve üzerlerine farklı kaplamalar kakao yenilebilir altın fındık vb. ile çikolatalı trüfler yaptım 

sorun şu ki her iki seferde de yanımızda getirdiğim yemeği alıp kaldırdılar hiç yiyemedim 

noel partisinde yeğenim kilere bile gitti ve dışarı çıktı sadece b'ye bugün yemeyeceğiz yarın onları yiyeceğiz hiç yemedik hiç yemedik trüflerden

beni gerçekten sinirlendiriyor zaman, emek ve para harcıyorum ve getirdiğim şeyleri bile yiyemiyorum ertesi günkü partileri için bedava yemek tedarikçisi değilim

üstelik çok çalışıyorum ve sadece misafirlerin benim yaptıklarımı yemesini ve güzel bir şeyler söylemesini istiyorum kocamın benimle gurur duymasını istiyorum

kocamla konuştum, sorunun çözümünün çok fazla çaba harcamamak olduğunu söyledi sadece yerel fırından bir kilo kurabiye al ve hepsi bu kadar onlar yetişkin yetişkinler ne yaptıklarını biliyorlar ve onlara görgü kurallarını öğretecek ebeveyn değil

eğer getirdiğimiz şeyleri yememize izin vermiyorlarsa bunu hak etmiyorlar

ama merak ediyorum belki soruna daha iyi bir çözüm vardır belki kibarca bir şeyler söyleyebilirim kocam bunun partide sadece bir skandala yol açacağını ve bizi kötü göstereceğini söylüyor

onların bu şekilde davranmasının nasıl kabul edilebilir olduğunu anlamıyorum ama benim bu konuda bir şeyler söylemem kabul edilemez kocam boş ver diyor

lütfen tavsiyede bulunun"
"Context:
So, we are both in our mid 20s. He was saving himself for somone he really felt was worth it (me?)  I, on the other hand am kind of a hoe (40+ notches). 

I talked with him about letting me know about his boundaries and what he is comfortable with and not. I dont mind being a teacher, i think its actually super admirable he has been purposely abstinent for this long. (I told him that). Its Something a lot of people dont do anymore. 
No, Neither of us are  religious. 
I don't think he has done more than make out.

The part i am asking for advice on is:

If he finishes before we even get going .. how can i help make him not feel embarrassed? Or what can i do to like, slow the excitment? How do i make it so he's comfortable??? 

Thanks in advance !!

Edit: yea, i get it im a hoe,  but i already said that. 
He does know about them, we have been close friends for 12 years and he said he doesn't mind because my past is in the past. 

I want to know how to help him feel comfortable and not self conscious about losing his virginity 

Second edit: 
Didnt expect this to get that much attention. 
There are now too many comments for me to keep up with 🙃

So thank you to the people who gave me real advice, and stood up for me in the comments. Yall supportive mfs know who you are and its greatly appreciated!!!! 

And to all the reddit incels that are out here tryina slut shame - go be negative somewhere else. Really shows how shallow and straight up mean you are and thats probably why your not getting laid lol . 

He knows my past. I told him id tell him the exact number and he said no, because it Doesn't matter!!!! He said hes just happy that i dont think less of him because hes a virgin.

"I know we should care what people think but sometimes things people’s say stick in my head. 

I’ve been with my girlfriend for 1.5 years and I have never thought I was punching above my class. My girlfriend is very pretty but I don’t think I’m unattractive. 

There is a woman who I think just hates me but I have to meet her at least once a year at big events. 

First time I met her, she was a maid of honour and I was best man at a mutual friend’s wedding. She said she didn’t want to walk down the aisle with me because she’s taller than me and it would look weird. I told her it doesn’t matter and she tried to back track and said she thought I would feel uncomfortable that is why she said it. I thought that was quite rude so I was happy to not see her for two years. 

I saw her yesterday at a party and bought my new (to her) girlfriend. Within half an hour she asked me “how did you get your pretty girlfriend’. I have never been asked this question before and I have had numerous beautiful girlfriends but I felt like she is trying to get a rise out of me so I responded with ‘God is good’. To which she started laughing. 

Since then it’s been messing with my head. Is my girlfriend out of my league and I’m just delusional?","insanların ne düşündüğünü önemsemeliyiz biliyorum ama bazen insanların söyledikleri kafamda kalıyor

yıllardır kız arkadaşımla birlikteyim ve hiçbir zaman sınıfımdan üstün olduğumu düşünmedim kız arkadaşım çok güzel ama çekici olmadığımı düşünmüyorum

sanırım benden nefret eden bir kadın var ama yılda en az bir kez büyük etkinliklerde onunla görüşmek zorundayım

onunla ilk tanıştığımda nedimeydi ben de ortak bir arkadaşın düğününde sağdıçtım benimle koridorda yürümek istemediğini çünkü benden uzun olduğunu ve garip görüneceğini söyledi, ona bunun önemli olmadığını söyledim ve geri adım atmaya çalıştı ve rahatsız olacağımı düşündüğünü söyledi bu yüzden bunu söyledi bunun oldukça kaba olduğunu düşündüm bu yüzden onu iki yıl boyunca görmediğim için mutluydum

dün onu bir partide gördüm ve yarım saat içinde kız arkadaşına yenisini aldım bana güzel kız arkadaşını nasıl elde ettiğini sordu daha önce hiç böyle bir soru sorulmamıştı ve çok sayıda güzel kız arkadaşım oldu ama sanki benden çileden çıkmaya çalışıyormuş gibi hissettim bu yüzden Tanrı iyidir diye cevap verdi ve gülmeye başladı

"Another update bc my inbox is still flooded and I cant reply to everyone so just going to say it all here for you guys and anyone else who wants to know. Been like 5 months now.. jfc

Firstly thank u for all the nice messages and offers of help and stuff. I really do appreciate it and sorry if i havent replied but i have had literally 100s of messages and its kind of overwhelming for me. I have read most of them and am still trying to reply to more but its a big job 

Currently things are going ok. Big things that have happened/are happening- 

My older sister (the second oldest) is coming to visit soon. The relationship between her and my older brother is kind of strained bc of some shit that happened when they were younger and the 3 older ones all lived together for a bit after leaving home. Honestly i think it was just a shit show having 3 damaged teenagers living together in a new place with no support. I dont have time to be the mediator though so just told them if they cant get along then my sister will need to leave bc the kids dont need any more drama and my brother needs to focus on being a parent. She’s coming bc she wants to, and she said she wont cause any drama she just wants to help. We’ll see how it goes anyway but Im lowkey dreading it. Last time I saw this sister was years ago though so i’m trying to not think she’s going to be the same as she was when she was a teenager

We have started planning to move to WA. My brother is desperate to get out of our town and not have to worry about our parents showing up (he gets a lot of anxiety about it, he doesnt like me being at home without him being here). His job will help him move over there and he has been set on it for a while now. We will be able to transfer over there even with the kids being on kinship care which is basically the only thing i was worried about. But thats confirmed we will be fine to do it so now i’m on board with it. Wont be any time soon but hopefully end of the year we can move

Financially we are doing pretty good. We have the kinship money, mine and my brothers wages and my older sisters have been sending money consistently. My brother is good with money and we are able to save some. I was able to buy the kids a small present each to cheer them up on mothers day. They have like barely any toys so the little ones are psyched to have some things to play with and have been being feral outdoors way less this week. They have been playing lego and barbies like normal children 

7yr old sleeps so good when I give her melatonin. I dont do it every night but when I do its like a mini holiday. She sometimes wakes up mad but I can deal with that when I have actually slept. Other nights when she doesn’t have it I either keep her downstairs and hope she will fall asleep on me or my brother whilst watching TV, or I go through the emotional bedtime routine of her crying and saying she doesn’t want to go to bed whilst I read the same 3 stories until she chills out. She is doing better at school again now. It was pretty bad for a while (obviously bc she was permanently exhausted and surviving on literal air only bc the kid wouldnt sleep or eat). 

Right now 9 and 13yr olds are doing the telehealth therapy sessions. 7yr old won’t speak to the therapist so she’s having indirect help through me. 12yr old hates it so my brother is trying to learn techniques to do with him to help him. 16yr old refuses which I was expecting anyway. Tried to force her to do it and that didnt go well. So again I just try to give her indirect help. I had some 1-1 time with her recently and she was different in a good way. She lets her guard down when the younger kids arent there. Like she can be vulnerable or whatever. She said “thank you for looking after us” to me on MD. 

Havent seen any more messages on 16yr olds phone from our mum, she has completely stopped messaging any of us. The last thing she said to me was she doesnt know why I’m turning her kids against her. Kinda hilarious tbh but just proves she is deep in delulu land. 

On mothers day 7 year old went outside 4 times before 8am to “make sure mum isnt coming down the road” and she has been crying about our dad, not sure why exactly, when I ask she just says shes worried about him. 9yr old gets annoyed with her and tells her to stop crying because our dad is a bad person. She is also very defensive of me and my brother and tries to police all the other kids and tells them to behave and be nice to us and dont argue/backchat/misbehave. I think she’s concerned we will get fed up and leave. Ofc i reassure her we wont and she doesnt need to tell the others off. Its kinda funny anyway tbh because she is no angel herself 

Their diet is a lot better. We still have issues every meal of every day but overall its better and they are doing well with trying to eat new things. Years of ramen and chicken nuggets has obviously been horrible for our bodies. But they all have at least 1 fruit or veg a day and have real dinners. They like pasta bake so thats the new ramen around here. My brother cooks curry and tries to get them to eat it but that doesnt go down so well. They like when he makes chicken and potatoes. 7yr old likes Bluey pouches of vanilla custard and would eat those for every meal if i let her

My oldest sister is still a pain in the ass and wants to talk about our trauma all the time. She just has more time to dwell than i do. I have no time to dwell. I asked her to please not message me unless its positive or helpful. Her reply showed she really is just jealous that i am giving all my time and energy to the kids but i really dont have it in me to look after an adults emotional needs as well. She sees me as her kid and she wants to see me but doesnt want to see the younger ones. Like she asked me to come visit and leave them with my brother for a few days. Im not going to leave insecure kids who are permanently stressed that i will leave for good. Imagine how  stressed they would be the whole time. She also thinks i am babying them. But im just treating them like children. Mostly its just annoying that she is like this but its also partly upsetting because tbh there is nothing i would love more than for her to meet and love 7 year old. For me it would be like my ‘mum’ meeting my child. Bc my oldest sister raised me when i was really young and 7yr old is the only one of the kids i have fully raised since she was a tiny baby and my mum told me she didnt want her

Anywayyyy i am trying not to get to caught up in everything with my older sister because i have enough going on with alll the kids. 

My grandma is still at my aunts house and very unhelpful. But shes not bothering me much so thats ideal. She mentioned wanting my cousin to move in here because he got kicked out by his girlfriend and has no where to live. But fuck that fr. He’s a creep and a drug addict so no way is that happening. over my dead body

Okkkk this has taken me like 3 days to finish writing and i have probably forgotten some stuff but really just wanted to say thanks for the support and i’m not ignoring my messages i just am busy and overwhelmed

"So my cousin(26f) just had her baby boy few days ago and she is having his baptism done tomorrow. 
So today when I went out I ran into another relative and she told me that my cousin has decided a name for the baby and its ‘Loveda’. But when u pronounce it, it sounds like a slang in hindi which is loosely translated to mean male genitalia. So basically the name is written as Loveda but pronounced here as the Hindi slang.
 So a little context about my cousin, she doesn’t speak Hindi and mainly grew up in our little town in Kerala,so there is no way for her to know about it. And she plans to eventually go to northern cities for her husband’s job. I am afraid that the kid might get bullied a lot in his life. 
I tried talking to my mom and grandpa and they both think that we should not tell them because it might cause a rift in the family. 
What should I do? Should I let it be?

"Okay so this is a throwaway account, I'm 23 F dating my bf 26 M together almost for 2 years

Recently, during sex, he brought up this wild idea about him tattooing “his name's property” on me down there so i'd be ""officially his."" It caught me off guard, but since we were in the middle of roleplay, I just went along with it &amp; said yes to that since it was just bedroom talk

fast forward a few days, and he casually brought it up again asking if i'd be okay wd him tattooing that phrase on me down there, I thought he was still joking, so I played along sarcastically, telling him i'd love to get it tattooed, thinking there’s no way he was serious. now 5 days after this incident ,he actually ordered a 800 $ tattoo pen

I was so thrown off and honestly felt super weird about it,  I told him that I thought he wasn’t serious at all. He got really disappointed and said he was serious because he’s already tattooed my name on his collarbone. Since he knows I don’t want a visible tattoo, he figured this would be a good “compromise” because no one else would see it but him , this seems really controlling to me and this controlling behavior has been surfacing more frequently like he insists on knowing exactly where I am at all times and gets upset if I don’t respond to his texts right away

We ended up having this ridiculous argument yesterday .He’s upset, saying he’d gladly tattoo my name or anything related to me anywhere on his body again , so he can’t understand why I won’t do this one thing for him. I told him I wasn’t okay with this, and eventually, he calmed down and agreed to drop it.  
But I can still sense that he’s mad at me and upset that I wouldn’t do something for him that he would do for me without hesitation.

honestly, I can’t believe this is even a real argument 

I know this is serious, and I don’t want to ignore the signs but it’s hard for me to look at it that way cuz I love him more than anyone. he genuinely loves me , always checking up on me and making sure I'm okay. he’s always there for me ,even in my hardest times when no one was there to help me...I’m genuinely worried about how our relationship could escalate, especially considering he has a short temper and he has started being so controlling recenty ,what should I do....I feel really bad &amp; suffocated when I'm the reason he gets upset regarding something

𝗘𝗗𝗜𝗧:I didn’t share much about our relationship,&amp; there’s a lot to consider
I know a lot of you are saying I should leave him &amp; hes a red flag, its not that easy for me cuz

he's never shown any manipulative signs before,cares about me a lot &amp; never made me feel like im a burden to him in any way,he's moved countries for me , quit his job &amp; wen through the hassle of finding a new one near where we live now , 
he stopped talking his parents cuz htey dont like me &amp; wouldnt accept our relationshp cuz from their pov i have too much INFLUENCE on him &amp; that i am distancing him from his family ,when in reality i am not 

in all our disagreements ,even tho hes short tempred ,he’s never yelled at me or showed any signs of hitting me, always respected my boundaries regarding literally anything...except a couple times when he annoyed the shit out of me asking my location 24/7 n who m hanging out with (which happened recently)

He’s close with my family &amp; my friends all like him (I haven’t told them about the recent stuff), it’s not like he’s ever tried to ISOLATE me or anything

he came up to me today bringing up the tattoo thing
he admitted that it was a stupid kink and fantasy he had in his mind, n he got carried away with. He said he was truly ashamed &amp; disgusted by how he reacted to it , feels horrible for making me uncomfortable with himself for even having such an idea

It really got to him &amp;he started crying,saying he knows this recent controlling behavior is damaging our relationship, says he needs 2nd chance &amp; hopes I don’t give up on him cuz he genuinely needs help, he had been thinking about his behaviour from the past months and it had been bothering him but he was unable to address it to me cuz he fears i'd break up .

He kept apologizing, saying he wasn’t thinking straight when he ordered the pen.He made it clear dat he won't ever force me or pressure me to do anything or get mad for things if i dont want to do it &amp; wont second question my decision ever again

he suggested we go couple therapy &amp; hes ready to work on himself cuz he feels like he’s losing control over his actions &amp;doesn’t fully understand why this is happening

I really appreciate the advice and support,&amp; I’ll definitely be keeping it in mind as I figure out what should i do

son zamanlarda seks sırasında bana ismini dövme yaptırma fikrini ortaya attı böylece resmen onun olacaktım bu beni hazırlıksız yakaladı ama rol yapma oyununun ortasında olduğumuz için buna uydum ve yatak odası sohbeti olduğu için evet dedim

birkaç gün ileri saralım ve o konuyu tekrar açtı ve bana o cümleyi dövme yaptırmasını kabul edip etmeyeceğimi sordu hala şaka yaptığını sanıyordum bu yüzden alaycı bir şekilde ona dövme yaptırmak istediğimi söyledim ciddi olmadığını düşünerek bu olaydan günler sonra bir dövme kalemi sipariş etti

çok şaşırdım ve dürüst olmak gerekirse bu konuda çok garip hissettim ona hiç ciddi olmadığını düşündüğümü söyledim çok hayal kırıklığına uğradı ve ciddi olduğunu söyledi çünkü köprücük kemiğine ismimi dövme yaptırmıştı çünkü görünür bir dövme istemediğimi biliyordu bunun iyi bir uzlaşma olacağını düşündü çünkü bunu başka kimse görmeyecekti bu bana çok kontrolcü geliyor ve bu kontrolcü davranış daha sık yüzeye çıkıyor, her an tam olarak nerede olduğumu bilmekte ısrar ediyor ve mesajlarına hemen cevap vermezsem sinirleniyor

dün saçma bir tartışmaya girdik, üzgündü, tekrar vücudunun herhangi bir yerine adımı veya benimle ilgili herhangi bir şeyi dövme yaptırmaktan mutluluk duyacağını söyledi, bu yüzden neden bunu yapmadığımı anlayamıyor, ona bununla iyi olmadığımı söyledim ve sonunda sakinleşti ve bırakmayı kabul etti

ama hala bana kızgın olduğunu ve tereddüt etmeden benim için yapacağı bir şeyi benim için yapmadığım için üzgün olduğunu hissedebiliyorum

dürüst olmak gerekirse bunun gerçek bir tartışma olduğuna inanamıyorum

bunun ciddi olduğunu biliyorum ve işaretleri görmezden gelmek istemiyorum ama benim için bu şekilde bakmak zor çünkü onu herkesten çok seviyorum, beni gerçekten seviyor, her zaman beni kontrol ediyor ve iyi olduğumdan emin oluyor, en zor zamanlarımda bile, kimse bana yardım etmediğinde bile her zaman yanımda oluyor, özellikle de çabuk sinirlenen biri olduğunu ve son zamanlarda çok kontrolcü olmaya başladığını düşünürsek, ilişkimizin nasıl tırmanabileceği konusunda gerçekten endişeliyim, ne yapmalıyım gerçekten kötü hissediyorum ve onun bir şey hakkında üzülmesinin sebebi olduğumda boğuluyorum

ilişkimiz hakkında fazla bir şey paylaşmadım ve dikkate alınması gereken çok şey var
birçoğunuzun onu terk etmem gerektiğini söylediğini biliyorum ve o bir kırmızı bayrak benim için o kadar kolay değil çünkü

daha önce hiç manipülatif işaretler göstermedi benimle çok ilgilendi ve bana hiçbir şekilde yükmüşüm gibi hissettirmedi benim için ülke değiştirdi işini bıraktı ve şu an yaşadığımız yere yakın yeni bir iş bulmanın zorluğuyla uğraşırken
beni sevmedikleri için ailesiyle konuşmayı bıraktı ve ilişkimizi kabul etmedi çünkü onların bakış açısından onun üzerinde çok fazla etkim var ve gerçekte olmadığım halde onu ailesinden uzaklaştırıyorum

tüm anlaşmazlıklarımızda sinirli olmasına rağmen bana hiç bağırmadı veya beni dövmeye dair hiçbir işaret göstermedi her zaman kelimenin tam anlamıyla her konuda sınırlarıma saygı gösterdi birkaç kez beni çok sinirlendirdiği zamanlar hariç konumumu ve kiminle takıldığımı sordu ki bu da oldu son zamanlarda

ailemin ve arkadaşlarımın hepsi onu seviyor, onlara son zamanlardaki şeylerden bahsetmedim, beni izole etmeye veya başka bir şeye çalışmadı

bugün yanıma gelip dövme meselesini gündeme getirdi
aklında aptalca bir sapkınlık ve fantezi olduğunu itiraf etti ve buna nasıl tepki verdiğinden gerçekten utandığını ve tiksindiğini söyledi, böyle bir fikre sahip olduğu için bile beni rahatsız ettiği için korkunç hissettiriyor

gerçekten sinirlendi ve ağlamaya başladı, bu son kontrolcü davranışının ilişkimize zarar verdiğini bildiğini söyledi, şansa ihtiyacı olduğunu ve umarım ondan vazgeçmem çünkü gerçekten yardıma ihtiyacı var, son aylardan beri davranışlarını düşünüyordu ve bu onu rahatsız ediyordu ama benimle konuşamadı çünkü ayrılmaktan korkuyor

kalemi sipariş ettiğinde doğru düzgün düşünemediğini söyleyerek özür dilemeye devam etti, beni asla hiçbir şey yapmaya zorlamayacağını veya baskı yapmayacağını veya yapmak istemediğim bir şey için sinirlenmeyeceğini ve bir daha asla kararımı sorgulamayacağını açıkça belirtti

o çift ​​terapisine gitmemizi önerdi ve kendisi üzerinde çalışmaya hazır çünkü hareketleri üzerindeki kontrolünü kaybettiğini hissediyor ve bunun neden olduğunu tam olarak anlamıyor

tavsiye ve desteği gerçekten takdir ediyorum ve ne yapmam gerektiğini anlarken kesinlikle aklımda tutacağım

"My daughter is 31 years old. Seven months ago we had a problem, she was hurt by something I said at a family gathering. It took her a long time to tell me what the issue was. She was texting me cruel and sarcastic messages and i didn't understand why. When she finally told me what the problem was, I apologized as sincerely and profusely as I could. 
She accepted my apology, well, she said she did anyhow.
Since that time, the messages she sends are still mean and sarcastic, and they happen daily. The messages now are about how unhappy she is with her life and passive aggressively blaming me for her problems.
The trouble is that she only texts me, she won't accept a phone call for us to talk it out.
I want to understand her and try to repair the relationship, but I can't keep being her punching bag.
She recently had a birthday and I took her out for dinner to celebrate. I didn't want to bring up these issues, because I didn't want to wreck her day, but I thought she would have addressed the issues at some point. She did not, she acted like everything was fine. Two days later, the texts started up again.
How do I set boundaries in this situation? I want to be there for her,  but I can't keep dreading every message she sends.","kızım yedi ay önce bir sorun yaşadık, bir aile toplantısında söylediğim bir şeyden dolayı incinmişti, bana sorunun ne olduğunu söylemesi uzun zaman aldı, bana acımasız ve alaycı mesajlar atıyordu ve nedenini anlayamadım, sonunda sorunun ne olduğunu söylediğinde olabildiğince içten ve bolca özür diledim
özürümü kabul etti, en azından kabul ettiğini söyledi
o zamandan beri gönderdiği mesajlar hala acımasız ve alaycı ve her gün geliyor, şimdiki mesajlar hayatından ne kadar mutsuz olduğu ve pasif agresif bir şekilde sorunları için beni suçlamasıyla ilgili
sorun şu ki sadece bana mesaj atıyor, konuşmak için telefon görüşmelerimizi kabul etmiyor
onu anlamak ve ilişkiyi onarmaya çalışmak istiyorum ama onun yumruk torbası olmaya devam edemem
yakın zamanda doğum günü oldu ve onu kutlamak için yemeğe çıkardım, bu konuları gündeme getirmek istemedim çünkü gününü mahvetmek istemiyordum ama bir noktada sorunları dile getireceğini düşündüm, dile getirmedi, her şey yolundaymış gibi davrandı, iki gün sonra mesajlar gelmeye başladı tekrar
bu durumda sınırları nasıl belirlerim onun yanında olmak istiyorum ama onun gönderdiği her mesajdan korkmaya devam edemem"
"Okay, so... 
My mother took me out of school in the fourth grade, and I haven't gone since. 

She also hasn't been teaching me anything, and I really need to know how to learn stuff. 

She expects me to magically learn everything, go to college at sixteen, and then become a doctor or something. 

She won't put me back in school because she thinks if she tries to cps will take me away. 

I don't know what to do. ","tamam yani

"My parents are divorced and my mum left for work at around 10am, my dad was supposed to pick us up at 12 but he isn't answering any calls or texts so he can't be asleep since his phone is never on silent and it's 3pm now, it's been 3 hours and I'm scared. I've called my mum and she's tried calling him but he won't pick up. My uncle said he would go round and check on my dad since he lives round the corner from him but he hasn’t got back to my mum on that yet.

"It's cause age of consent in my state is 16, and the dude knows that. and he knows that pursuing a romantic relationship with me is not gonna get him in trouble as I'm above the age of consent, but it's still predatory asf and weird.  
I feel harassed by him, and I don't know what to do.  
I told my dad, but he said that his friend is just like that, and that I should just let him be.  
And the other day, he got drunk and started weirdly touching me and fucking tried to kiss me. AND MY DAD WAS THERE AND DIDN'T DO ANYTHING HE JUST LAUGHED IT OFF.  
I want him to stop. He's not my type. He's too old. He literally knows me since I was 4 years old, and he was just counting down the seconds before I turned the legal age of consent, and that sucks.

If this continues, I'm afraid he will do something worse.

Update: I decided to go into his personal computer, to see his chats with my dad and if my dad has talked to him about this at all. And i found a folder in his computer filled with images of me showering/putting my clothes on. I mentioned in another comment that he lives with us, but I never thought he kept such pictures like that. I never agreed to those pictures being taken, was never aware he took those pictures, and it's very disgusting. 

Some of the pictures are way back from when i was 11-12. those were taken years ago.","bunun nedeni benim eyalette reşit olma yaşının olması ve adam bunu biliyor ve benimle romantik bir ilişki sürdürmenin onu başını derde sokmayacağını biliyor çünkü reşit olma yaşının üstündeyim ama bu hala yırtıcı bir durum ve garip
ondan taciz edildiğimi hissediyorum ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum
babama söyledim ama arkadaşının da böyle biri olduğunu ve onu rahat bırakmam gerektiğini söyledi
ve geçen gün sarhoş oldu ve bana garip bir şekilde dokunmaya başladı ve beni öpmeye çalıştı ve babam da oradaydı ve hiçbir şey yapmadı, sadece güldü
onun durmasını istiyorum, o benim tipim değil, çok yaşlı, beni yaşımdan beri tanıyor ve reşit olma yaşıma gelmeden saniyeleri sayıyordu ve bu berbat

Bazı fotoğraflar benim olduğum zamandan kalma, yıllar önce çekilmişler"
"**Update and Edit;**  


I've been getting a lot of comments and i'd like to thank you all for doing so. It really helps even if it's just someone listening in. I wanted to edit this and post somewhat of an update to clarify things a bit more since i didn't really share enough information initially. People end up giving great advice but i asked the wrong questions so to speak.  


My son is autistic. He's very attached to his teacher who's made incredible progress with him. He doesn't respond well to changes in his life. Having him move places, away from his mom, his grandma, his friends, his school etc. Is going to be incredibly difficult for him to the point where i don't know how he could recover from that. My daughter is an early teen. She has so much changes going on already and she's finally found a group she's close with and fits in. Do you think i should take them away from here, completely flipping their lives upside down if it means i can protect them from what's to come (bullying)?  


My mother who loves her grandkids and loves my wife lives in a retirement home. She's unwell and knows something is going on but doesn't know exactly what. If i tell her exactly what happened, i fear that i'm gonna break her and hurt her to the point where she gets sicker and sicker. Do i  tell her what happened or do i tell her a white lie to not risk it? She can't come and visit us. We usually go to her unless it's holidays or about once every two months i pick her up and bring her home. Moving means that's gonna be more difficult. The kids love her and i don't want to take them away from each other.  


**Then the update part;**  


The last couple of hours i've been getting more texts from people who are concerned or are warning me about videos going around in whatsapp groups. All in all the effort we (a close friend and i) took to take down videos has been useless because it's going around in town and there's no way to stop it. All i can do now is damage control. I just don't know what the right steps are for my kids and so far, both my close friends and reddit are almost 50/50 about it.   


My lawyer and i will discuss custody. I'm not sure how to do this yet. The kids love their mom, and she loves them and taking them away from one another might not be the best option. On the other hand, if she's seen with our kids and people put two and two together, they might still be unsafe even if we move.  


Therapy is being worked on for the kids and myself.

I am definitely divorcing my wife  
I'm going to talk with the school board this week and they've already started watching the kids for their safety.  


My wife called me and she wants to talk. I'm thinking about whether i should right now.

My brother called, who's about 30km away asking me what's going on because he's seen the video in a whataspp group as well. So it seems to be spreading fast to other towns as well.   


I'm having a talk with my oldest daughter tomorrow and i'm going to give her the space and time to express her feelings, i'm gonna listen to her and let her make up her own mind. I'm gonna support her and tell her i'm there for her if she needs me and i'm gonna try and explain it to her in a way that it's understandable and i'm not going to slander my wife infront of her or any of our kids for that matter.  


I think that's all for now. I'll try keep up with comments and get back to you as much as i can. Again thank you so much for your advice and listening. My wife has not been talking up till just now and i'm going to talk to her about what she's going to do to protect our kids.   


 **End of update.**  


  
About a week ago i got contacted by my wife's best friend's husband asking if we could meet up and talk. Long story short, he dropped a bomb on me telling me our wives were cheating on us and showed me a video that has been spreading on porn sites of our wives and their friend having sex at their old house with some guys we've never seen. When i confronted my wife about it, she went thru all the stages of emotions and all the excuses she could come up with. She even said it wasn't her even tho her face is clearly visible. I immediately called my lawyer and explained things to which he told me to take a breather, collect my thoughts and he sent me an email with things to do so i can take it step by step.

I (46m) and my wife (44) have three kids. Our Daughters (12 and 4) and our son (9). They all go to school where we live. They're all doing sports or activities. They love it here, they're doing great and i this is where the biggest issue comes in. We live in a small town and word has definitely gotten around. A lot of things i noticed before knowing this had happened make so much more sense now. Weird looks, people ignoring me or flat out excusing themselves quickly when they talk to me. People know, people have seen it and i'm so scared for my kids. Our eldest daughter has already recieved comments about it in school. Along the lines of: ""your mother is a whore"". And as someone who was bullied a lot in school, and knowing that these videos are close to impossible to take down, i'm so scared that they're gonna get bullied and their lives are gonna be destroyed.

The only possible option for me seems to be to leave town and start over elsewhere. But i don't want my kids to miss out on their friends, their hobbies and activities. It's gonna rip them out of their lives. But staying here, where everyone knows, seems to incredibly unsafe.

I'm probably missing a lot that i should be adding. Please, if there's any information left to share, i will update. But for the last week all i've been grinding my head about is how to keep my kids safe. Is there anything i can do at all?","update and edit

"I’ve been putting off writing this update but am back because I need even more advice and an outside perspective. The comments have been pretty helpful so far. Thank you.  It’s long but I’ll do my best to shorten it. …***trigger warnings for SA drugs violence*** 

First of all Dani and I have bonded. She and I talk every day and message constantly. I didn’t expect that but it’s truly wonderful. She says she needs a good straight friend right now (jk) and honestly she is a great person and has been a huge support to me despite what she has been going through. I told her I posted here as I felt guilty as to tell my story I had to tell hers. She was ok with it. She is thinking of waiving her right to anonymity when the trial comes as she wants everyone to know she was raped and by who. Dani has quit her job moved to her parents full time and is in therapy. She’s just about ok. Surviving still rather than living but she is so strong and amazing. 

Justice moves slowly here so there isn’t too much of an update on the legal process. Marcus was told however  he would not face charges for assault for attacking the two actively attacking Dani. 

I went back to work and it was awful. I work for a tiny start up. Oscar who works there is friendly with Marcus and my brother. We are all into martial arts and attend the same Dojo. So I’m getting a lot pity. I’d have been ok with sympathy or empathy but being pitied sucks. Still it’s better than being home all day doing nothing. 

Daniel gave me space as I asked and he is truly a good guy. There is nothing romantic there at all though. I’m not in a fit state for anything like that and won’t be for a very very long time  and he is just a good guy. No ulterior motives. We text a bit and he is in a lot of contact with Dani. 

I got a letter in the mail  from Alex. Said he held out hope while I hadn’t blocked him but once I did he was distraught. He told me he doesn’t want to freak me out by turning up in person and I know that wouldn’t look good for him anyway but he just wanted to tell his side of the story. He said he was pressured into doing stuff with the escorts and he “only” got a bj. The other two were really pressuring him to do more but he didn’t and says he regrets even doing that. He admits he was angry at Dani because she told him he either told me about the cheating or she would but he knew he was totally in the wrong. He knew I would dump him for cheating so he took everything he could get his hands on. He’s not even sure what he took and while he remembers pulling off Dani’s shoes he doesn’t remember anything else. 

So he was just peered pressured and drunk and drugged up and he did nothing wrong at all basically . I was just disgusted to read this. His total lack of accountability is just sickening! I’m not responding to him ever. Any future mail goes unopened into the trash. I’m in therapy but it’s early days and it’s m not seeing progress yet. 

That’s leaves me with Marcus. He knows I’ve been angry with him and he is desperate to talk it out. I probably feel too much anger towards him but find it hard not to. He is still feeling very guilty over making Dani stay. I don’t understand why I feel so angry towards him. It’s not on the level of anger I feel towards Alex by any means but I’m still hesitant to talk to him. I think he made mistakes but in my heart I know he was dealing with a lot that morning but I just wouldn’t have been there when Alex got home if I had known the truth. I feel Marcus should have told me everything as I was the one who had to face Alex alone. I know I should hear him out but am finding it very hard. How can I get past this? I want to clear the air with him even if we are never friends and me cutting him out is really having a terrible effect on him. I know he rescued Dani and has been constantly checking up on her. I know he can be a good guy but part of me feels he wasn’t all good that weekend. I don’t know! I haven’t touched this in therapy as we are just starting and are talking about Alex. I need advice on how to deal with this . I wanted to give it some time but Marcus mental health is pretty poor and maybe by not meeting him I am just making him worse? How can I find it in me to just bite the bullet and hear him out? Why am I so angry with him? How can I move past this? I don’t want to be angry at him. I’m so exhausted from being angry at him and at Alex and I want it to stop , at least towards Marcus . But it won’t! Help! 

I’m visiting Dani for the weekend that should have been my wedding. We are going to have a LOTRs marathon and her mother is making a cheesecake. My own family have been wonderful in every way but Dani is truly why I’m still standing. 

EDIT: forgot to say it wasn’t an Air bnb. It was just a privately rented house. I just assumed incorrectly it was. ","Bu güncellemeyi yazmayı ertelemiştim ama daha fazla tavsiyeye ve dışarıdan bir bakış açısına ihtiyacım olduğu için geri döndüm yorumlar şimdiye kadar oldukça yardımcı oldu teşekkür ederim uzun ama kısaltmak için elimden geleni yapacağım sa uyuşturucu şiddeti için tetik uyarıları

öncelikle dani ve ben kaynaştık o ve her gün konuşuyoruz ve sürekli mesajlaşıyoruz bunu beklemiyordum ama gerçekten harika şu anda iyi bir heteroseksüel arkadaşa ihtiyacı olduğunu söylüyor şaka yapıyorum ve dürüst olmak gerekirse o harika bir insan ve yaşadıklarına rağmen bana çok büyük destek oldu ona hikayemi anlatmaktan suçlu hissettiğim için buraya yazdığımı söyledim ona anlatmak zorundaydım bununla ilgili bir sorunu olmadığını mahkeme geldiğinde anonimlik hakkından vazgeçmeyi düşünüyor çünkü herkesin tecavüze uğradığını ve kim tarafından tecavüze uğradığını bilmesini istiyor dani işinden istifa etti tam zamanlı olarak ailesinin yanına taşındı ve terapi görüyor hala hayatta kalmaktan çok iyi ama çok güçlü ve muhteşem

adalet burada yavaş işliyor bu yüzden yasal süreçle ilgili çok fazla güncelleme yok marcus'a ancak saldırı nedeniyle saldırı suçlamasıyla karşı karşıya kalmayacağı söylendi ikisi de dani'ye aktif olarak saldırıyor

işe geri döndüm ve korkunçtu küçük bir start-up olan oscar için çalışıyorum orada çalışan marcus ve kardeşimle arkadaş canlısı hepimiz dövüş sanatlarıyla ilgileniyoruz ve aynı dojoya gidiyoruz bu yüzden çok fazla acınma görüyorum sempati veya empatiyle iyi anlaşıyordum ama yine de acınmak berbat bir şey bütün gün evde hiçbir şey yapmadan oturmaktan iyidir

daniel istediğim gibi bana alan tanıdı ve gerçekten iyi bir adam orada hiç romantik bir şey yok ama ben böyle bir şey için uygun durumda değilim ve çok çok uzun bir süre olmayacağım ve o sadece iyi bir adam hiçbir art niyet yok biraz mesajlaşıyoruz ve dani ile çok fazla iletişim halinde

alex'ten postayla bir mektup aldım, onu engellemediğim halde umutlu olduğunu söyledi ama engellediğimde perişan oldu, şahsen gelerek beni korkutmak istemediğini söyledi ve bunun kendisi için iyi görünmeyeceğini biliyorum ama sadece hikayenin kendi tarafını anlatmak istedi, eskortlarla bir şeyler yapmaya zorlandığını ve sadece bir oral seks yaptı diğer ikisi gerçekten daha fazlasını yapması için ona baskı yapıyordu ama yapmadı ve bunu yaptığı için bile pişman olduğunu söylüyor dani'ye kızdığını itiraf ediyor çünkü ona ya bana aldattığını söylediğini ya da bana söyleyeceğini söyledi ama tamamen yanlış yaptığını biliyordu aldattığı için onu terk edeceğimi biliyordu bu yüzden eline geçen her şeyi aldı ne aldığından bile emin değil ve dani'nin ayakkabılarını çıkardığını hatırlasa da başka hiçbir şey hatırlamıyor

yani sadece dikizlendi, baskı gördü, sarhoş oldu ve uyuşturuldu ve hiçbir yanlış yapmadı temelde bunu okumaktan tiksindim onun tamamen hesap verebilir olmaması mide bulandırıcı ona asla cevap vermiyorum gelecekteki hiçbir postam açılmadan çöp kutusuna gidiyor terapideyim ama daha erken günler ve henüz ilerleme göremiyorum

bu beni marcus'la baş başa bırakıyor ona kızdığımı biliyor ve bunu konuşmak için can atıyor muhtemelen ona karşı çok fazla öfke duyuyorum ama bunu yapmamak zor dani'nin kalmasını sağladığı için hala çok suçlu hissediyor neden ona karşı bu kadar öfkeli olduğumu anlamıyorum bu seviyede değil Alex'e karşı her ne olursa olsun öfke duyuyorum ama onunla konuşmakta hala çekiniyorum, hatalar yaptığını düşünüyorum ama kalbimin derinliklerinde o sabah çok şeyle uğraştığını biliyorum ama gerçeği bilseydim Alex eve geldiğinde orada olmazdım Marcus'un bana her şeyi anlatması gerektiğini düşünüyorum çünkü Alex'le tek başıma yüzleşmek zorunda kalan bendim Onu dinlemem gerektiğini biliyorum ama bunu nasıl aşabilirim? Onunla havayı temizlemek istiyorum, asla arkadaş olmasak bile ve onu dışlamam onun üzerinde gerçekten çok kötü bir etki yaratıyor Dani'yi kurtardığını ve onu sürekli kontrol ettiğini biliyorum İyi bir adam olabileceğini biliyorum ama bir parçam o hafta sonu iyi olmadığını hissediyor Bilmiyorum terapide buna hiç değinmedim çünkü daha yeni başlıyoruz ve Alex hakkında konuşuyoruz Bununla nasıl başa çıkacağım konusunda tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var Biraz zaman vermek istedim ama Marcus'un ruh sağlığı oldukça kötü ve belki de onunla görüşmeyerek onu daha da kötüleştiriyorum Sadece dişimi sıkıp onu dinlemek için içimde nasıl güç bulabilirim Neden ona bu kadar kızgınım Bunu nasıl aşabilirim? İstemiyorum ona kızmak ona ve alex'e kızmaktan çok yoruldum ve en azından marcus'a karşı durmasını istiyorum ama işe yaramayacak

Dani'yi hafta sonu ziyaret ediyorum, düğünüm olması gereken bir lotrs maratonu yapacağız ve annesi cheesecake yapıyor kendi ailem her açıdan harika ama hala ayakta kalmamın asıl nedeni dani

"(UPDATE! I'm very sorry for not updating this sooner but I completely have forgotten and kept putting it off, but...my mom has been located and I've reunited with her. I so very much appreciate everyone caring and the support, thank you all so much)

 My mom (F50) has been missing for 3 days now and I'm starting to think she's dead. Let me explain, I'm F16 and on December 6th at 11am she came into my room to tell me she's going to her appointment and that if I want, she can just drive herself there. Now before I continue here's some context, she takes lots of medicine every day, has heart issues, head seizures, is restricted driving, and haven't taken her dementia meds in a few days since she lost them...hence the appointment, also the phone bills haven't been paid. (later on when I say ""I called"" I say that because I got a text now free number, and that my mom has 2 phones, one of which doesn't need a phone bill since its free) But back to the story...at the time that she asked I was asleep and did NOT want to get up, get ready, and drive to the appointment, so...half-awake I say ""yea"" to her driving herself there. Which is a rare thing since I'm strict on her not driving since she's restricted due to heart issues and head seizures. But I was sleepy and not thinking all the way. So now after she leaves my room to head to her appointment I fall back into sleep. Hours go by and I wake up to her not home, I figure she might be at the hospital since they might've just brought her there from the appointment (happens sometimes, but not a common thing though still). I wait and the hours go by, now I'm worried so...I call police. He says that she's at the hospital...I'm more relaxed and relieved knowing she's being taken care of at the hospital safe. So, I call the hospital and ask for a patient by her name...but they say no one is there by that name. Now I'm really worried, why would the cop say she's at the hospital but when I call, they say she's not there. So, the next day I call my mom's friend, this time she answers, (I called my aunt too but no answer, and I have no one else except my mom's friend.) I tell her what's happening, and she says she hasn't heard from her either, so she says she'll try and do something, which turned out to be her calling the cops. So, about a hr pass and cops come knocking asking questions and saying if she doesn't come home tmrw then call. So now they left, and I'm alone confused and scared more. I'm alone, no car,  no answers from my mom, no sign of anyone hearing from her, the appointment place is closed so I can't ask if she arrived and if she did in fact go to the hospital, moms free phone might be dead but I think she has a charger since she usually has one w her so idk why she hasn't charged it, no clue where she is if she's alive or not. I've come to the point that I'm thinking of how life's going to be without her, my brain has slipped into deep sadness, and I've started coming to the fact she might not be coming home. But then I think to myself that ""she might come home soon, and I'll be relieved and happy, and we will talk about it all and everything will be alright"" but then my mind snaps back to reality at the moment and how I'm alone right now with not a 100% she's coming back. My brain isn't giving on the hope she's still okay, but the other part is thinking I'm already an orphan and life's over for me and my mom. It's all my fault I let her drive herself and now here I am... going through something I thought I wouldn't have to go through, at least for a long time. It feels like no one cares or is worried too. I'm torn...help.","güncelleme bunu daha erken güncellemediğim için çok üzgünüm ama tamamen unutmuşum ve ertelemeye devam ettim ama annem bulundu ve onunla yeniden bir araya geldim, ilgilenen ve destek olan herkese çok teşekkür ederim hepinize çok teşekkür ederim

"I am getting proper medical care and close monitoring and I have social support--but I also have family who *cannot* know about this. I hope you can take my word on why this is genuinely important for my well-being.

I may need two procedures on different days within the same week--an endometrial biopsy and then a D&amp;C.

I need a straightforward explanation that won't worry them, that I'd need some level of sedation for, and that leaves no marks.

"So my (15F) family often hangs out and plays board games with each other and tonight we were doing just that when my mom decided to play never have I ever. The questions started out innocent like “never have I ever peed in a pool” and “never have I ever been to another country” but they slowly started to get more and more sexual. Some of the questions were “Never have I ever taken someone’s virginity”, “Never have I ever had sex in a pool”, “Never have I ever visited a sex shop” (which my whole family drank to so that made me wanna blow my brains out) and “Never have I ever been in a threesome.” there were more but those are the worse.

"Throw away account.

I (16f) was assulted at a party about 2 months ago. I admittedly had gotten a bit drunk. And was in the company of one of my closest friends (19m) but in my drunken state. He betrayed me in a way I can never forgive. I never told anyone what happend that night. Just cut all contact with him. And havnt spoken to him since.  Well. Fast forward to 4 days ago. Me and my freinds decided to do that ""pregnancy roulette"" thing on tiktok where you all take pregnancy tests and mix them up in a cup. Well one came back positive. So we all took another one to see who it belonged to. And it belonged to me. My freinds were shocked and joking about it, all assuming it happend from my boyfriend (17m) but I know It didn't. Me and my boyfriend have always been very careful and always used protection while doing stuff together. I have no clue what to do. I wanted to forget all about this. And just move on. But now I'm stuck with part of it forever. Also I have to tell people in my life about this. How do I tell my boyfriend I'm pregnant with another man's baby? How do I tell my mom I'm pregnant, but it'd not my fault except it kinda is since I was drunk. I'm scared, lost, and clueless. 

UPDATE: after thinking about it and after all of your guys comments. I decided to tell my mom.it was hard to do. But I knew it needed to be done. I let her read the post I made because every time I tried to speak I just started crying and choking up and I was unable to talk. So my mom read the post in silence. Then looked at me and pulled me into a hug while she started crying. She told me she here for me 100 percent. Whether I choose to keep the baby or not. And if I wanna file a police report or not. I'm pretty sure I'm going to get a abortion. Because I don't think it would be possible for me to live with a child that is half of the man who traumatized me. I'm gonna tell my boyfriend everything when I see him tomorrow, and I'll let you guys know what happens then. ","hesabı at

My girlfriend has anger issues and I try to tolerate her about it. But today she was angrier than ever AND started damaging my belongings. Instead of helping/calming her in that situation, I gave in to my anger and shouted and told her to get out. In a fit of anger, she took one of my knives and threatened me.

"Using an alt account because this is a bit embarassing and I dont want him or anyone I know to find this post 😭.

So me and my bf have been together for almost 2 years now (long distance), and I recently lost my v card to him while visiting. I'm not gonna go into too much detail but he has problems retracting his foreskin, and apparently it hurts a bit and it worries me. I've heard of stories how people have had surgeries for that kinda stuff, but I'm not sure if he's aware. It also had a bit of a smell which fuels my concerns even more. In no way am I unhappy with our sexlife or trying to embarass him but I'm just worried for him and his well-being. Is it normal or should we be concerned? Also how do I take this up with him without embarassing him 😓

EDIT: Yall I talked about it with him and I think I over exaggerated the situation. He CAN pull it all the way back, just with a pinch of pain (apparently normal w uncut guys). Also the time we had sex was my first time so I had no idea what dick is supposed to smell like. The smell wasn't putrid or concerningly strong, just what you would expect from genitals 😭, he does clean it.
P.S. Me and him are under 20, take that into consideration please and thank you

Yall going too far saying I should dump him over this shit, really shows how shallow people can be to dump their partners over something that can be fixed.

Hello all I'm 24f and my husband is 29m. I had a discussion with my doctor recently and was told I need to be on disability due to my mental health and physical health. My husband said if I try to file for it he'll kick me out of the house yet I'm stuck unable to work due to my physical issues. I have a really bad back and have seizures. This is why my doctor says I need to be on disability combined with my PTSD and other mental issues. I'm now treated as a maid. My dad says it's time for me and my children to just move back in with him so I can get myself taken care of. He gave me his disability lawyers number to call and set up a consultation for my disability claim. Should I just go through with getting on disability? I'm just tired of being treated like dirt because of my issues. It's gotten to where my oldest daughter doesn't want to live with my husband anymore because of the arguments and him threatening to kick me out all the time. She's seen him push me into walls and everything and I'm just at a loss right now. I need to do what's best for me and my health but I don't know what's best for me anymore. Any advice is appreciated. ,"Merhaba herkese, ben f ve kocam e. Yakın zamanda doktorumla bir görüşme yaptım ve ruh sağlığım ve fiziksel sağlığım nedeniyle engelli maaşı almam gerektiği söylendi. Kocam başvuruda bulunursam beni evden atacağını söyledi ama fiziksel sorunlarım nedeniyle çalışamıyorum. Sırtım çok kötü ve nöbetlerim var. Bu yüzden doktorum, travma sonrası stres bozukluğum ve diğer ruhsal sorunlarımla birlikte engelli maaşı almam gerektiğini söylüyor. Şu anda bir hizmetçi gibi davranıyorum. Babam, benim ve çocuklarımın kendi başıma bakabilmem için onunla tekrar yaşamamın zamanının geldiğini söylüyor. Engellilik avukatının numarasını verdi ve engellilik talebim için bir danışmanlık görüşmesi ayarlayabilirim. Engelli maaşı almaya devam etmeli miyim? Sorunlarım yüzünden pislik gibi muamele görmekten bıktım. En büyük kızım, tartışmalar ve beni sürekli evden atmakla tehdit etmesi yüzünden artık kocamla yaşamak istemiyor. Kocamın beni duvarlara ittiğini ve her şeyi gördüğünü söyledi ve şu anda ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum. Kendim ve sağlığım için en iyisini yapmam gerekiyor ama artık benim için en iyisinin ne olduğunu bilmiyorum. Her türlü tavsiye takdir edilir."

"My older sister (24) asked me (17) to dog sit for her just a couple days before Christmas, to which I of course agreed to. I've dog sat for her about 6-8 times before, so I felt pretty confident that everything would go well.

 She brought her dog over the next day with his bed, some dog food, and a couple of dog toys. She left a few minutes later, and everything was normal. He's a frenchie, about 3-4 years old, so he always runs around when he's here. He ran up and down the stairs, following my mom around because he really likes her, since she always spoils him.

 Usually, there's a routine he does: run around the house, run around the backyard, drink some water, chill out for a while, repeat. A couple hours later, my parents left, he calmed down and took a couple naps. He'd get up if he heard barking, and stand by the back door if he wanted to go out back, but he didn't really run around much, just walked. 

I thought he was just lethargic, since he lied down for a couple hours doing nothing, and maybe a bit depressed, because he's super attached to my sister and sits by the front door whining when he misses her (which he a couple times), and also because my mom didn't give him much attention as usual since she was preoccupied with something.

For the next 3 hours he lied in bed, sometimes napping, sometimes waking up to bark at other dogs barking, and a couple times going in the backyard to go pee. During this time, I thought it was weird that he wasn't as energetic as usual, but I thought that it was because the house was basically dead quiet (the downstairs TV was broken), he's sad that my sister wasn't there, and bored as fuck because there's basically no toys for him to play with. 

I tried playing with him and his squeaky toy and plushie, but he didn't seem interested at all. So I got my switch, placed it in front of him, and put on Bluey for him (I heard that dogs like watching it), but he also didn't seem very interested in that either; but I did leave it on for him for a couple hours though.

After the 3rd hour of him lying in bed (about 5:30), I texted my sister saying ""Your dog is depressed, when are you getting him?"" which she replied saying ""I'm on my way."" He jumped up and ran over to her when she opened the door, and they left 20 minutes later.

The next morning she texts me saying, ""Did my dog fall in the pool?"" (the pool got drained recently) to which I ask ""Why?"" ""He's limping and whimpering like he's in pain and he can't run at all, did he jump off your bed?"" ""No, he lied on a towel when he was in my room"" (my bed is tall and I also brought him upstairs briefly while waiting for my parents to finish arguing downstairs)

The next day my mom gets a call from my sister, and she was crying about how her dog is in a lot of pain and that he had to be sedated every couple hours.

A few days later, my mom told me that he died on Christmas morning. She said that he either had to get an expensive surgery on his lumbar or get put to sleep. The surgery was just too expensive and my sister was forced to make the latter decision. My mom told me that both her and my sister don't blame me since it was just an accident, but I don't know what to think about that.

They think he might've broken his back when he ran up stairs to my mom's room and hopped off her bed. I was literally there when I saw him hop off, and he literally looked down a was super careful when getting off. I don't understand how he could've gotten hurt, he's jumped on and off her bed a couple handfuls of time before and he was always fine. I hadn't texted for called my sister after learning what happened, and neither had she.

Last week, my sister had to move back in our house due to some circumstances at her house. She leaves at around 5 a.m for work and doesn't get back till 5-8 p.m, so we haven't run into each other face-to-face yet. I've been trying to avoid her because I don't know how to face her and apologize. 

Since she hadn't said anything to me after moving back in, I thought she didn't wanna talk to me and that maybe she hated me; but a few days ago she texted me a cat reel (I used to send her cat reels every few days), so I was thinking that she doesn't completely hate me. A couple days ago, I was in the bathroom when she called for me and said that she got me something and that she was gonna leave it on my bed, to which I replied ""Okay"". She got me a couple drawing books and a cute cat card game.

 I feel really horrible because I can tell she still cares for me and doesn't hate me, but I don't know how to apologize or if I should even bring it up. My sister had it rough growing up, and even rougher when she moved out, but she seemed way happier after getting her dog. I really want to apologize but I genuinely don't know how to.

(sorry for writing so much, just wanted to explain thoroughly)

Edit: thank you everyone for the advice and kind reassurances, it gave me the courage to talk to her and apologize. We're all good now, thank you very much!","Ablam Noel'den birkaç gün önce köpeğine bakmamı istedi ve ben de tabii ki kabul ettim. Daha önce birkaç kez köpeğine baktım, bu yüzden her şeyin yolunda gideceğinden oldukça emindim

Ertesi gün köpeğini yatağıyla birlikte getirdi, biraz köpek maması ve birkaç köpek oyuncağı verdi, birkaç dakika sonra gitti ve her şey normaldi, yaklaşık 40 yaşında bir Fransız köpeği, bu yüzden burada olduğunda her zaman etrafta koşturur, annemi çok sevdiği için merdivenlerden yukarı aşağı koşardı, çünkü annem onu ​​her zaman şımartıyor

Genellikle bir rutini vardır, evin etrafında koşar, arka bahçede koşar, biraz su içer, bir süre rahatlar, birkaç saat sonra tekrar eder, annem ve babam gitti, sakinleşti ve birkaç şekerleme yaptı, havlama sesi duyduğunda kalkar ve dışarı çıkmak istediğinde arka kapının önünde beklerdi ama çok fazla koşmadı, sadece yürüdü

Birkaç saat boyunca hiçbir şey yapmadan yattığı ve belki biraz depresif olduğu için sadece uyuşuk olduğunu düşündüm çünkü kız kardeşime aşırı bağlı ve onu özlediğinde ön kapının önünde oturup sızlanıyordu, ki bu da bir birkaç kez ve ayrıca annem her zamanki gibi ona fazla ilgi göstermediği için çünkü bir şeyle meşguldü

sonraki saatlerde yatakta yattı, bazen uyukladı, bazen havlayan diğer köpeklere havlamak için uyandı ve birkaç kez bu süre zarfında arka bahçeye işemeye gitti, her zamanki gibi enerjik olmamasını garip buldum ama bunun evin temelde çok sessiz olmasından kaynaklandığını düşündüm, alt kattaki televizyon bozuktu, kız kardeşimin orada olmamasına üzüldü ve çok sıkıldı çünkü oynayabileceği hiçbir oyuncak yoktu

onunla ve gıcırdayan oyuncağı ve peluşuyla oynamaya çalıştım ama hiç ilgilenmemiş gibi görünüyordu, bu yüzden anahtarımı alıp önüne koydum ve ona bluey taktım, köpeklerin onu izlemeyi sevdiğini duydum ama o da buna pek ilgi duymamış gibi görünüyordu ama yine de birkaç saat açık bıraktım

yatakta yattığı üçüncü saatten sonra kız kardeşime köpeğin depresyonda olduğunu ve onu ne zaman alacaksın diye mesaj attım, o da yoldayım dedi, kız kardeşim kapıyı açtığında ayağa fırladı ve ona doğru koştu kapı ve birkaç dakika sonra gittiler

ertesi sabah bana köpeğimin havuza mı düştüğünü sordu havuz yakın zamanda boşaltıldı ve ben de neden acı çekiyormuş gibi topalladığını ve sızlandığını ve hiç koşamadığını sordum senin yatağından mı atladı hayır odamdayken bir havlunun üzerinde yattı yatağım yüksek ve ayrıca annemle babamın aşağıda tartışmayı bitirmesini beklerken onu kısa bir süreliğine yukarı çıkardım

ertesi gün annem kız kardeşimden bir telefon aldı ve köpeğinin çok acı çektiğinden ve her birkaç saatte bir sakinleştirilmesi gerektiğinden ağlıyordu

birkaç gün sonra annem bana köpeğimin noel sabahı öldüğünü söyledi ya belinde pahalı bir ameliyat olması gerektiğini ya da uyutulması gerektiğini söyledi ameliyat çok pahalıydı ve kız kardeşim ikinci kararı vermek zorunda kaldı annem bana hem kendisinin hem de kız kardeşimin beni suçlamadığını çünkü bunun sadece bir kaza olduğunu söyledi ama bunun hakkında ne düşünmem gerektiğini bilmiyorum

merdivenlerden yukarı annemin odasına koşarken sırtını kırmış olabileceğini düşünüyorlar ve yataktan atladı, onu atlarken gördüğümde tam oradaydım ve tam olarak aşağı baktı ve inerken çok dikkatliydi, nasıl yaralanabildiğini anlamıyorum, daha önce birkaç kez yatağına atlayıp inmişti ve her zaman iyiydi, ne olduğunu öğrendikten sonra kız kardeşime mesaj atmadım veya onu aramadım ve o da aramamıştı

geçen hafta kız kardeşim evindeki bazı durumlar nedeniyle evimize geri taşınmak zorunda kaldı, sabahın erken saatlerinde işe gidiyor ve akşama kadar geri dönmüyor, bu yüzden henüz yüz yüze görüşmedik, onunla nasıl yüzleşeceğimi ve özür dileyeceğimi bilmediğim için ondan kaçınmaya çalışıyorum

geri taşındıktan sonra bana hiçbir şey söylemediği için benimle konuşmak istemediğini ve belki de benden nefret ettiğini düşündüm ama birkaç gün önce bana bir kedi makarası mesajı attı, ona birkaç günde bir kedi makarası gönderiyordum, bu yüzden benden tamamen nefret etmediğini düşünüyordum birkaç gün önce banyodaydım, beni aradı ve bana bir şey aldığını ve yatağıma bırakacağını söyledi, ben de tamam, beni aldı dedim birkaç çizim defteri ve sevimli bir kedi kart oyunu

gerçekten çok kötü hissediyorum çünkü hala benimle ilgilendiğini ve benden nefret etmediğini söyleyebilirim ama nasıl özür dileyeceğimi veya bunu gündeme getirip getirmemem gerektiğini bilmiyorum kız kardeşim büyürken zor zamanlar geçirdi ve evden ayrıldığında daha da zor zamanlar geçirdi ama köpeğini aldıktan sonra çok daha mutlu görünüyordu gerçekten özür dilemek istiyorum ama gerçekten nasıl yapacağımı bilmiyorum

"My gf (23f) thanks me (24m) for the dumbest things. Like recently I made coffee for her and she thanked me for putting milk in instead of the creamer I put in my coffee. She thanked me again for it a few days later through text. Which confuses me bc we've been dating for a year, I know how she likes her coffee, why would I make it any other way? And she does this for all sorts of stuff like going to doctor appointments with her or washing the dishes. I wouldn't mind if it was just a passing ""Oh thanks for doing that"" but I feel like she's almost praising me for doing very bottom of the barrel stuff. I've told her before that she doesn't need to thank me for this stuff as it literally takes 0 effort or thought for me to do them and I enjoy doing things for her but she still does and I never really know how to reply besides ""You're welcome I guess?"" Idk it just makes me feel weird to get praised for doing basically nothing.

Edit: thanks y'all! You've made me realize this is another way she says 'I love you', it just happens to not be my particular love language and I'm just not use to getting thanked for stuff. I think it's actually very sweet that she thanks me for this stuff now. 

Edit 2: before anyone else feels the need to comment it, yes I am autistic","kız arkadaşım bana en aptalca şeyler için teşekkür ediyor, örneğin yakın zamanda ona kahve yaptım ve kahveme koyduğum krema yerine süt koyduğum için teşekkür etti, birkaç gün sonra mesaj yoluyla tekrar teşekkür etti, bu beni şaşırttı çünkü bir yıldır çıkıyoruz, kahvesini nasıl sevdiğini biliyorum, neden başka türlü yapayım ki ve bunu doktor randevularına gitmek veya bulaşıkları yıkamak gibi her türlü şey için yapıyor, sadece gelip geçici bir şey olsa aldırmam, bunu yaptığın için teşekkürler ama sanki en kötü şeyleri yaptığım için beni övüyor gibi hissediyorum, daha önce ona bunun için bana teşekkür etmesine gerek olmadığını, bunları yapmak için gerçekten çaba veya düşünce gerektiğini ve onun için bir şeyler yapmaktan zevk aldığımı söylemiştim ama yine de yapıyor ve nasıl cevap vereceğimi hiç bilmiyorum, ayrıca rica ederim, sanırım bilmiyorum, temelde hiçbir şey yapmadığım için övülmek beni garip hissettiriyor

düzenle teşekkürler hepinize bunun seni sevdiğimi söylemesinin başka bir yolu olduğunu fark etmemi sağladınız, sadece benim özel aşk dilim değil ve buna alışkın değilim bir şey için teşekkür almak bence bu şey için bana teşekkür etmesi çok tatlı

"So, my mother and my brother argues everyday over the littlest things and once she grabbed a belt and started to hit him with it and told me to call the cops because he jumped on her furniture. my brother was a victim of child sexual abuse at 11 and after that she started to think he is masturbating with no proof at all! another reason why she thinks hes been doing it was because he likes to be in the dark and she does not think its normal. she would say things like ""what are you doing in that room?"" ""turn some lights on"" ""have you been beating your meat?"" ""you're nasty"" and a bunch a weird stuff like that and i wanna know how to tell her that he have not been masturbating! every time i try to try to tell her she says ""thats' a lie"" ""whatever"" Can someone help me?

"Hello, I F28 slept with my best friends brother (M24) at her wedding. I feel so terrible and have no idea what to do.

Bit of context, last year my fiancé cheated then left me for another woman, I’ve been in a pretty dark place since. Shortly after this crap time my best friend (F28) announced that her boyfriend had proposed and she was getting married and she asked me to be her maid of honour she’s honestly the nicest person ever and I was so happy for her.

The wedding was yesterday and I had been spending a lot of time with her brother (M24) who was also the best man. Ive known her brother for years but never really properly talked to him until recently. We were at the same New Year’s party, he came to my families bbq, we’ve seen each other a lot at his sisters house planning the wedding stuff and chilling. He also helped me move out of my old house. He is really good looking and we seem to get on really well.

The wedding was yesterday and at the reception after a few drinks people started dancing, he asked me to dance and I said sure we danced a bit, talked and then things got heated and he invited me back to his hotel room and we had sex. I was a bit tipsy but not drunk.

Although I had a really good time with him I feel so horrible and feel as if I betrayed my best friend on the biggest day of her life. To my knowledge no one knows this happened I spoke with him this morning and said not to mention anything to anyone and let me think. He was really understanding and says he likes me and that we should tell his sister because he wants to start a relationship with me. I like him too but I just know his sister is going to hate me and she’s been such a good friend through a shitty time in my life. I also don’t want to ruin their relationship because they are a really close family.

To make things worse about 2-3 years ago another one of our friends mentioned that she thought her brother was hot and she made a big thing about how it would be weird If one of her friends dated her brother.

Ive been sat in my room since I got home crying my eyes out not knowing what to do please give me some advice.

  
EDIT:

Thank you so much to everyone who has given me advise, has made me feel 100% better. I spoke with her brother this morning and we are going to slow things down a little and see how it go for the next 2 weeks whilst she is on her honeymoon which he is really happy about (as am i). Then once she returns i am going to speak with her and discussed what happened and that its not just a fling and i think i do have feelings. Thank you all so much! xxx","merhaba en yakın arkadaşımın erkek kardeşi m ile düğününde yattım kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum

düğün dün ve onun sağdıç olan erkek kardeşi m ile çok vakit geçiriyordum kardeşini yıllardır tanıyorum ama yakın zamana kadar onunla gerçekten doğru düzgün konuşmamıştım aynı yılbaşı partisindeydik ailemin barbeküsüne geldi birbirimizi kız kardeşinin evinde sık sık gördük düğün planlarını ve takılmaları yapıyorduk ayrıca eski evimden taşınmama yardım etti gerçekten yakışıklı ve çok iyi anlaşıyoruz gibi görünüyor

onunla gerçekten iyi vakit geçirmeme rağmen kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum ve sanki hayatının en önemli gününde en iyi arkadaşıma ihanet etmişim gibi hissediyorum bildiğim kadarıyla kimse bunun olduğunu bilmiyor bu sabah onunla konuştum ve kimseye hiçbir şeyden bahsetmememi söyledi ve bana gerçekten anlayışlı olduğunu ve benden hoşlandığını ve kız kardeşine söylememiz gerektiğini çünkü benimle bir ilişkiye başlamak istediğini söyledi ben de ondan hoşlanıyorum ama kız kardeşinin benden nefret edeceğini biliyorum ve hayatımın kötü bir döneminde çok iyi bir arkadaş oldu ayrıca ilişkilerini mahvetmek istemiyorum çünkü onlar gerçekten yakın bir aile

yıllar önce işleri daha da kötüleştirmek için bir arkadaşımız daha kardeşinin ateşli olduğunu düşündüğünü ve arkadaşlarından birinin kardeşiyle çıkmasının garip olacağı konusunda büyük bir şey yaptığını söyledi

"ever since i was little i was made to use the same bath water as my siblings. I’m usually the one who goes in first as i’m the eldest but i think that it’s unfair my brother AND sister have to go in after me. Sometimes my parents will go in first as well and then me and my siblings will have to go in after, so that’s 5 of us sharing the same bath water? I have asked my mum before if i can just use the shower instead, we literally have two showers? But she usually says no. On the rare occasion, i’m allowed to use the shower, but that only happens like once a month. I’ve also confronted my mum before and said that I feel it’s disgusting and unhygienic that me (16), my brother (14) and my sister (12) have to wash our hair and bodies in the same water! But she just doesn’t care, I’ve cried about it before as I have trouble with feeling unclean and always have to make sure I smell good and feel clean 24/7 but she says that she’s my mother and she can decide whether I’m allowed to shower or not. I’ve also talked to my friends about this and they think it’s disgusting too. I honestly don’t know what to do and don’t know if I’m being dramatic. I also get periods and am not allowed in first when I have it, so when i’m on my period i have to wash my hair and body in everyone else’s bathwater including my period blood water?!?😭 My family aren’t poor either so money can’t have anything to do with it.","Küçüklüğümden beri kardeşlerimle aynı banyo suyunu kullanmak zorunda kaldım. Genellikle en büyük olduğum için önce ben girerim ama bunun haksızlık olduğunu düşünüyorum. Kardeşim ve kız kardeşim bazen benden sonra girmek zorunda kalıyor ve bazen annem ve babam da önce giriyor ve sonra ben ve kardeşlerim sonra girmek zorunda kalıyoruz, böylece aynı banyo suyunu paylaşıyoruz. Daha önce anneme duşu kullanabilir miyim diye sordum, kelimenin tam anlamıyla iki duşumuz var ama genellikle hayır diyor, nadiren duşu kullanmama izin verildiğinde ama bu sadece ayda bir oluyor. Ayrıca daha önce annemle yüzleştim ve kardeşim ve kız kardeşimin saçlarımızı ve vücudumuzu aynı suda yıkamak zorunda kalmamızın iğrenç ve hijyenik olmadığını hissettiğimi söyledim ama umursamıyor. Daha önce kirli hissetmekte sorun yaşadığım ve her zaman güzel koktuğumdan ve temiz hissettiğimden emin olmak zorunda olduğum için bunun için ağlamıştım ama annem onun annem olduğunu ve duş alıp alamayacağıma karar verebileceğini söylüyor. Ayrıca bu konuyu arkadaşlarımla da konuştum ve onlar da bunun iğrenç olduğunu düşünüyor. Dürüst olmak gerekirse ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum ve abartıyor muyum bilmiyorum. Ayrıca adet görüyorum ve adet olduğumda ilk başta bana izin verilmiyor, bu yüzden adet olduğumda saçımı ve vücudumu herkesin banyo suyuyla yıkamak zorundayım, kendi adet kanı suyum dahil ailem de fakir değil, bu yüzden paranın bununla hiçbir ilgisi olamaz"
"So I (26m) went to the dentist today to finally get my braces removed. The hygienist who I met for the first time (25f) and I were talking nonstop about almost everything. We clicked right away and really thought she was cute. I wasn’t planning on saying anything about it. Before I left she gave me a piece of paper with instructions on how to keep my retainers clean but as she was handing it over she asked “btw are you single?” My face got so red. Started blushing immediately and got so nervous. I told her yes. She then said “I wrote my number on it so give me a call whenever” I was blushing so hard. I said “I don’t think a girl has ever asked me for my phone number” and she said “I had to shoot my shot”. I also pointed out that I was blushing and didn’t know how to react. I was so nervous since it was unexpected.

"This is as embarrassing as it sounds.

I’m 17 and still live with my parents. Typically i’d be trying to go to bed when i hear them getting it on, although i think they try to be subtle they still make noise loud enough for it to be heard from my room across from the house.

The part that triggers me is the fact they most likely know i’m still awake, they’d usually have the lights on prior which i’d tell them to turn it off - which they respond to, then minutes later go at it.

this really makes me uncomfortable, maybe a stretch but i’m bordering on this being sexual harassment because i really don’t want to have to listen to that (when i have to wake up at 5:30am) but also it’s making me averse from sexual activities all together.

i really want it to stop but i don’t know how, any suggestions?

EDIT:

Okay so clearing up some things.

beyond some of the top comments i’m noticing some repetition in things being said so i’m gonna address them:

“why would this effect you so much” 
i guess not wanting to hear someone related to you getting it on is too far according to you guys.
I’ve also had sexual trauma in the past from early childhood, to my mid teens, some of which is still getting repaired by, so this topic can be really triggering. Beyond the fact that i grew up in a type of house that doesn’t talk about this kind of things, id be shamed for even bringing it up.

“get headphones”
so i’ve been doing this lately and it’s probably my best solution, thanks.

“you’re 17, grow up”
wow thanks i didn’t know i’m not allowed to express complex emotions at my age. 
maybe it’s something i was just unaware i should be fine with and mature with but like i said before, i guess not wanting to hear someone related to you getting to on is too far.

“move out”
im also looking to do this also for reasons beyond this LOL, i live in a country where that’s very hard though.

“be grateful your parents love eachother”
i don’t rlly know when yall got that impression, when i just said that part makes me uncomfortable. 



","bu kulağa geldiği kadar utanç verici

ben hala ailemle yaşıyorum genellikle onları yatağa girerken duyduğumda uyumaya çalışıyorum ama sanırım incelikli olmaya çalışıyorlar hala evin karşısındaki odamdan duyulabilecek kadar yüksek ses çıkarıyorlar

beni tetikleyen kısım büyük ihtimalle hala uyanık olduğumu bilmeleri genellikle önceden ışıkları açık tutarlar ve kapatmalarını söylerim ve birkaç dakika sonra ona cevap verirler

bu beni gerçekten rahatsız ediyor belki biraz abartıyorum ama bunun cinsel tacize dönüşme sınırındayım çünkü sabah uyandığımda bunu dinlemek istemiyorum ama ayrıca beni cinsel aktivitelerden tamamen soğutuyor

gerçekten durmasını istiyorum ama nasıl olduğunu bilmiyorum herhangi bir öneriniz var mı

düzenleme

tamam, bazı şeyleri açıklığa kavuşturalım

en çok yorumun ötesinde söylenen şeylerde bazı tekrarlar fark ediyorum bu yüzden onlara değineceğim

bu seni neden bu kadar etkiliyor
sanırım seninle akraba birinin bunu yapmasını istememek çok ileri bir şey sizler
ben de erken çocukluğumdan ergenliğimin ortalarına kadar cinsel travma yaşadım ve bunların bir kısmı hala onarılıyor bu yüzden bu konu gerçekten tetikleyici olabilir bu tür şeyler hakkında konuşulmayan bir evde büyüdüğüm gerçeğinin ötesinde bunu gündeme getirdiğim için bile utanırım

kulaklık al
son zamanlarda bunu yapıyorum ve muhtemelen en iyi çözümüm bu teşekkürler

sen büyüdün
vay canına teşekkürler bilmiyordum yaşımda karmaşık duyguları ifade etmeme izin verilmiyor
belki de farkında olmadığım bir şeydi bununla iyi ve olgun olmalıyım ama daha önce dediğim gibi sanırım seninle akraba olan birinin bu konuya girmesini istememek çok ileri

taşın
ben de bunu bunun dışında sebeplerden dolayı yapmak istiyorum lol bunun çok zor olduğu bir ülkede yaşıyorum

ebeveynlerinizin birbirini sevmesine minnettar olun
bu kısmın beni rahatsız ettiğini söylediğimde ne zaman böyle bir izlenim edindiğinizi gerçekten bilmiyorum"
"I've been dating my boyfriend (21) for two months. When we first met, he was training to be a body builder. He LOVED it and was the picture of health. He was the first guy that I've dated that's been fit and it was HOT. About a month ago he told me that he's sexually attracted to morbidly obese women. Which is fine. I don't judge. I've dated both fat men and women. I didnt even judge him when he told me he's never watched porn, but rather videos of women squeezing their bellies. He asked me if it turned me on and I said no. It's the opposite. He kept pushing and pushing until eventually I grew disgusted. I expressed this to him when he told me that by the end of the year, his goal is to get me eighty pounds heavier. (I'm 19, 120 pounds, and a ballet dancer.) He also told me he wants to ""Get me so full that I'm sick, have sex with me, and then get me to eat more)  When I told them that he won't UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES try and get me fat, that I was disgusted, he decided to make himself fat. He told me he's going to try and gain at least 100 pounds, to go from 220 lbs to 320 lbs and that he wants to send videos of himself forcing food down his throat and squeezing his belly. He asked me, once again, if I would be into that and I said ABSOLUTELY NOT. I told him that it made me feel disgusted, the last thing on earth I want to do is have sex. He got mad and said ""I should've just done it and not told you."" Whatever, fast forward to now, he's now up to 280 lbs, (Yes, 280. I saw the scale myself) eats over 8,000 calories a day, and is starting to look grossly overweight, his words not mine. Last night, he sent me a before and after photo of his body when I first met him vs now and asked me what I liked more and I told him point blank that I liked him before. He then went on this whole rant, telling me how he ""Thought I liked it"" even though I've made it more than obvious that I didn't. Aside from health reasons, it's just unattractive to me.  I told him my mom had PCOS and has never, not once in her life been able to be thin, and how stupid it is to trade a perfectly healthy body for a fat one because he's sexually attracted to it. He started apologizing for over an hour, saying ""I'm not going to force myself to overeat anymore"" and then in between his apologies he was SENDING VIDEOS OF HIMSELF SHOVING HIS MOUTH FULL OF FOOD AND SQUEEZING HIS BELLY. He would go back and forth between ""I'm sorry, I have a problem"" to ""I just want you to squeeze my chubby belly"" Aside from this, he's one of the nicest guys I've ever been with and I've spent almost every single day with him for the past two months. It's important to mention we were friends long before we started dating. He won't listen to me. He wants me to be into his weird fat thing so bad that he's convincing himself I'm in to it. I don't want to end our relationship because of this, but the thought of being around him now, (with as much as he mentions it) makes me sick to my stomach. If I do end it, what do I say without crushing his soul? Help?'

Also, I'm willing to provide screenshots, vids, or pic to anyone who doesn't believe.  

                               Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx



UPDATE - Thank you all so much for your advice. I broke things off, though text. The truth is, I've known that I needed to break things off, for a while and I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't because I didn't want to be alone. I told myself being with him was better than being alone, but you guys showed me otherwise. I don't need to settle for some whack job. Just like Miley said, ""I can love me better than you can."" One thing I didn't mention, is that less than 4 months before I started dating this fetish guy, my ex beat me and SA'd me. When I talked about fetish guy helping me through something, this is what I was talking about. I felt this...obligation to put up with his shit not just because I felt like I owed it to him but because I was so beat down by my ex, I didn't have the will to fight. The truth is I'm not ready to be in a relationship. I knew that when I got into a relationship with fetish guy. I need to be single for a while, find myself, focus on my mental health, and healing. Thank you all so much. I wish you all happiness and luck with your relationships! ","Erkek arkadaşımla iki aydır çıkıyoruz, ilk tanıştığımızda vücut geliştirme eğitimi alıyordu, bunu çok seviyordu ve sağlık timsaliydi. Yaklaşık bir ay önce çıktığım ilk fit ve ateşli erkekti. Bana aşırı obez kadınlara cinsel olarak ilgi duyduğunu söyledi, sorun değil. Yargılamıyorum. Hem şişman erkeklerle hem de kadınlarla çıktım. Bana hiç porno izlemediğini, bunun yerine kadınların göbeklerini sıktığı videoları izlediğini söylediğinde onu yargılamadım. Bunun beni tahrik edip etmediğini sordu ve ben de hayır, tam tersi dedim. Sonunda iğrenmeye başlayana kadar sürekli zorladı ve zorladı. Bunu ona yıl sonuna kadar hedefinin beni seksen kilo daha ağır yapmak olduğunu söylediğinde söyledim. Ben bir bale dansçısıyım. Ayrıca beni o kadar doyurmak istediğini söyledi ki hasta olayım. Benimle seks yapıp daha fazla yememi sağlamak istediğini söylediğimde hiçbir koşulda beni şişmanlatmaya çalışmayacağını söylediğimde iğrenmiştim. Kendini şişmanlatmaya karar verdi. Bana en azından kilo almaya çalışacağını söyledi. lbs to lbs ve boğazından aşağı yemek zorla indirirken ve karnını sıkarken kendi videolarını göndermek istiyor bana bir kez daha bununla ilgilenip ilgilenmediğimi sordu ve ben kesinlikle hayır dedim ona bunun beni iğrendirdiğini söyledim dünyada yapmak istediğim son şeyin seks yapmak olduğunu sinirlendi ve bunu yapıp sana söylememeliydim dedi hızlıca ileri sar şimdi lbs'ye ulaştı evet kendim tartıya baktım günde 100 kalori alıyor ve aşırı kilolu görünmeye başladı onun sözleri benim değil dün gece bana ilk tanıştığım zamanki vücudunun öncesi ve sonrası fotoğrafını gönderdi ve şimdi neyi daha çok sevdiğimi sordu ve ona açıkça ondan hoşlandığımı söyledim sonra bana bundan hoşlandığımı düşündüğünü söyleyerek bir nutuk çekti oysa ben bunu açıkça belli ediyordum sağlık nedenleri dışında benim için çekici değil ona annemin pcos hastası olduğunu ve hayatında hiç zayıf olamadığını ve mükemmel sağlıklı bir vücudu şişman bir vücutla değiştirmenin ne kadar aptalca olduğunu söyledim sadece cinsel olarak ona ilgi duyduğu için başladı bir saatten fazla özür diledi, kendimi daha fazla yemeye zorlamayacağımı söyledi ve özürlerinin arasında ağzını yemekle doldururken ve karnını sıkarken kendi videolarını gönderiyordu, özür dilerim, bir sorunum var, sadece tombul karnımı sıkmanı istiyorum, bunun dışında şimdiye kadar birlikte olduğum en iyi adamlardan biri ve son iki aydır neredeyse her günümü onunla geçirdim, çıkmaya başlamadan çok önce arkadaş olduğumuzu söylemek önemli, beni dinlemiyor, garip şişman şeyine girmemi o kadar çok istiyor ki, buna girdiğimi kendine inandırıyor, bu yüzden ilişkimizi bitirmek istemiyorum ama şimdi onun etrafında olma düşüncesi, bundan bahsettiği kadar midemi bulandırıyor, bitirirsem ruhunu kırmadan ne söyleyebilirim yardım et

ayrıca inanmayan herkese ekran görüntüleri, videolar veya resimler sağlamaya hazırım

"I (M18) had earned 20k when I was younger (under 18), that money came from friends gifts, red packets, selfed earned money. All that money was so I can begin investing in things once I hit over 18, so everything I do would be legal. Now my mom has taken my money from the hidden place, and kept it for herself, she ""promised"" she'd return it but when I asked for it, she said it's all gone. I replied ""what's all gone?"" ""The money"" I replied why. And she said, well I had to pay for your transport fee, your food, your clothes, your school fees, the tax, your rent. I get so mad that I wanted to shout ""fuck you"". But I kept it in. Even now I'm fucking angry as shit. I replied (as calmly as I good), I was under 18 I do not have the ability to make money ontop of school. While in my head I'm thinking ""is it not the sole purpose for a parent to provide while a child is under 18????"" Now she's making other random bullshit about why I'm not getting money. Im now in my state where I want to throw punches but I can't. I'm still thinking, it's my money that IVE earned WHILE UNDER the age of 18. WHY can't I get MY money. And I'm still pissed as shit.

UPDATE:

Thank you all for the advice, this is one of my first post in all of Reddit, it has helped me alot. Just to clear up confusions, I am Asian and where I live its unlikely I can sue my parents for money, I've decided to sit down and have a chat with her. I also don't think running away would be the greatest idea, as I still highly depend on a roof over my head. But I still make my own food buy my own things.... Well that was before my money was taken. However I've decided that I'll cut contact after I move out, and face her upfront on her misdimenor. Again I truly appreciate all of Reddit community, it has given a great insight on what I should do next","Küçükken para kazanmıştım, o para arkadaşlarımın hediyelerinden, kırmızı paketlerden, kendi kazandığım paradan geliyordu, bütün o para, bir kez daha para yatırmaya başlayabileyim diyeydi, böylece yaptığım her şey yasal olacaktı, şimdi annem paramı gizli yerden aldı ve kendine sakladı, geri vereceğine söz verdi ama ben istediğimde hepsi gitti dedi, ben de ne oldu dedim, para, neden dedim ve dedi ki, ulaşım ücretini, yemeğini, kıyafetini, okul ücretini, vergiyi, kirayı ödemek zorunda kaldım, o kadar sinirlendim ki, siktir git diye bağırmak istedim ama içimde tuttum, şimdi bile çok sinirliyim, olabildiğince sakin bir şekilde cevapladım, iyiyim, okul parasına ek olarak para kazanma yeteneğim yok, kafamda bir ebeveynin tek amacının geçimini sağlamak olmadığını düşünüyorum, bir çocuk da şu anda çocukken, neden para almadığıma dair başka saçmalıklar uyduruyor, şimdi yumruk atmak istediğim ama yapamadığım eyaletteyim, hala bunun benim param olduğunu düşünüyorum, 18 yaşın altındayken neden paramı alamıyorum ve hala çok sinirliyim bok

"i (17f) went over to her (18f) house on saturday with three other girls (five in total) and at around seven or eight o'clock, we went to the pool near her house. it was empty other than us. i was wearing a kind of see-through-when-wet bikini (i regret it now ofc, but it was new so i didn't know it would be like this)  and did not realize until i went to change. 

anyways, while we were in the pool, she took a picture of me and another girl together, but didn't post it right away (she usually takes pictures and decides which ones to post afterward) which i didn't find strange as it's very common for her to do, and she's never done me wrong so i had no reason to be suspisious. 

she posted a few pictures from that day, and one of them was where my bikini was VERY see-through (you could basically see my enitre tits out). she did however post it onto her private story, which she claims to have around 20-25 people in, but i know a few of them and it made me uncomfortable that they could all see my private parts. 

most people who saw that picture (apparently) slid up and told her to take it down, but i didn't see it until around five or six hours after she posted it. when i did see it i asked her to take it down immediately but i didn't get a response till sunday evening and everyone said that that was the same case for them (for context, she posted all of the pictures at like 10-11am). 

she replied back and said that she was busy right now and will call me back later. i waited a couple of hours and i didn't hear anything from her so i texted her again and gave her a missed call. she answered my texts at 9:30-ish and refused to take them it down because 'i was being overdramatic'. she also said that it didn't matter if she did remove it as pretty much everyone on that story saw it (she also said that someone screenshotted it but i'm not sure if i can believe her or not).

as of now, all of the pictures are still up but will be automatically deleted by snapchat in a couple of hours. should i tell anyone about this, like an adult or someone in a position of auhtority? is there anything they can do? and what about the person who screenshotted it? 

any help will be appreciated, thanks. ","Cumartesi günü üç kızla birlikte onun evine gittim, toplam beş kız ve saat yedi veya sekiz civarı evinin yakınındaki havuza gittik, bizden başka kimse yoktu, üzerimde transparan bir bikini vardı, pişmanım ama yeniydi, bu yüzden böyle olacağını bilmiyordum ve değiştirmeye gidene kadar fark etmedim

Neyse, havuzdayken benim ve başka bir kızın birlikte fotoğrafını çekti ama hemen yayınlamadı, genellikle fotoğraf çeker ve hangilerini daha sonra yayınlayacağına karar verir, bunu garip bulmadım çünkü onun bunu yapması çok yaygındı ve bana hiç yanlış yapmadı, bu yüzden şüphelenmek için bir nedenim yoktu

O günden birkaç fotoğraf paylaştı ve bunlardan birinde bikinimin çok transparan olduğu bir fotoğraf vardı, neredeyse tüm göğüslerim görünüyordu, ancak bunu özel hikayesine paylaştı, iddiaya göre etrafta insanlar var ama birkaçını tanıyorum ve hepsinin özel bölgelerimi görebilmesi beni rahatsız etti

Görünüşe göre o fotoğrafı gören çoğu kişi yukarı kaydırıp kaldırmasını istedim ama ben ancak yayınladıktan beş altı saat sonra gördüm, gördüğümde hemen kaldırmasını istedim ama pazar akşamına kadar bir yanıt alamadım ve herkes bunun kendileri için de aynı olduğunu söyledi bağlam için tüm resimleri like am adresinde paylaştı

cevap verdi ve şu anda meşgul olduğunu ve beni daha sonra arayacağını söyledi birkaç saat bekledim ve ondan hiçbir haber alamadım bu yüzden ona tekrar mesaj attım ve cevapsız arama yaptım mesajlarıma ish adresinden cevap verdi ve kaldırmayı reddetti çünkü aşırı dramatik davranıyordum ayrıca hikayedeki hemen hemen herkesin gördüğü için kaldırmasının bir önemi olmadığını da söyledi ayrıca birisinin ekran görüntüsü aldığını söyledi ama ona inanıp inanmamam gerektiğinden emin değilim

şimdilik tüm resimler hala yayında ama snapchat tarafından birkaç saat içinde otomatik olarak silinecek bunu bir yetişkine veya yetkili bir konumdaki birine söylemeli miyim yapabilecekleri bir şey var mı ve ekran görüntüsünü alan kişi ne olacak

herhangi bir yardım takdir edilecektir teşekkürler"
"27F, I've always wanted an American Girl doll but grew up super broke and never got to have one 😭 

I make decent money now and I'm so tempted to buy myself one. I live on my own, but I feel like it's weird for a woman nearing her thirties w no kids to want an 18"" doll to dress up.....

I don't know who I'm even scared is going to judge me. I'm already in therapy but i'm nervous to bring it up lol. Do you think it's weird when adults buy children's toys for themselves?

"I asked this on another subreddit, but apparently it was against the rules.

A couple of nights ago I was awoken around 5:30am to my bedroom door being opened. I immediately sat up in bed and had my eyes on the door. I watched it open about 12 inches, not quickly, but not slowly. I became terrified because my door was locked. (It can be opened with a toothpick or something similar, but the lock stays locked) I watched the door slowly shut, it shut slower than it opened, and I just sat silently in my bed for a few minutes. My grandma lives with me, and is nearly across the hall, so after a few minutes I went into her bedroom and woke her up. I asked her if she’d been awake and opened my door, but she said no, and she was very asleep, so I believed her. She got out of bed and we checked all of the rooms with the lights on in case of an intruder. No signs, thought it may be paranormal, went back to sleep.

Tonight, 10:15ish I walk into my bathroom and there is literal shit on my toilet seat, not a skid mark but actual shit, and also shit in the toilet. I haven’t used my bathroom in hours, and I have a bidet, so I knew it was not me. I asked my grandmother if she’d used it, she said no, I kept trying to ask because it could have been embarrassing, but her en-suite is just a few feet away and it wouldn’t make sense anyway.

I am now quite terrified. On the other subreddit people suggested that there is a person intruding, to get cameras, and lock all things (all things are locked - to my knowledge). My worst fear is having a camera inside of my home and seeing a person on it, whether I am home or not. Nothing of high value is missing from my bedroom. My iPad and MacBook Pro are clearly visible.

I do not know what to do, as we live alone together, and these experiences happened very close together. Please give me advice or recommendations. Thank you so much.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE 12/6 5:26pm EST:** 

I have installed a Wyze Cam v3 facing the hallway. 

Found out my grandma recently started taking 50mg trazodone, not sure if that has interactions with any of her current medications. Her mother had Alzheimer's, and I am worried that it may be something related to that. 

I do not think I am sleepwalking because I have a bunch of things beside my bed like snacks and clothes that I would trip over without walking very specifically or carefully. I have a 6 month check-up with my Dr. tomorrow, and I am planning on asking about sudden medication interactions, as well as possibilities for memory and sleep walking for myself.

Did not get a chance to buy CO2 monitor today. We have gas for our hot water heater, as well as our stove. Something to do with that is a possibility I am considering.

Windows in one of the 3 bedrooms were not locked. 

Our doors to the outside (2) have a lock that can only be locked from the inside, and we use it every night. In both instances we have checked them and they are still locked. 

The attic opening is in the back of our hallway ceiling, and would leave dust as well as much noise, do not believe there is any access or activity from the attic. 

I am very touched and thankful for all of your kindness and recommendations you have given to me. I will continue to update this post when new things occur.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE 12/13:
My doctor changed my sleep medication dosage. I have another appointment with my medication management team in March. So far the camera has not caught anything except our inside dog, and us awake. The outdoor dogs have had two barking frenzies, which is out of the ordinary. Otherwise, as of now no further activity has occurred. My medications should not be giving me any adverse effects according to my Dr, so I am just continuing to wait and monitor the situation. Everything is for sure locked tight now.
I wish I had a more exciting update, but this past week has been pretty normal. I am happy about that. Thank you all for your support. I’ll continue to update if something new happens.","bunu başka bir subreddit'te sordum ama görünüşe göre kurallara aykırıymış

"3 days ago I (f/20) was at the bus station on my way to work, when a (presumably mentally ill) man showed up and started to threaten me with a knife. He was standing in front of me in a way that prevented me from fleeing. A young man, who I guess to be around 25 to 30 years old came by (we always take the same bus in the morning) and tried to deescalate the situation, but he ended up getting stabbed in the stomach. The crazy guy fled immediately afterwards and I called an ambulance and the police for the young man. They took him to the hospital and I was questioned by the police, who shortly after caught the guy who stabbed the young man. I didn't get the chance to say thank you to him. He was on the verge of passing out after he got stabbed. But I know which hospital he is in and I want to thank him. But I really don't know how I can appropriately thank him for risking his life to protect mine. We have never talked to each other, just taken the same bus for the last months. I feel guilty that he is now hurt, when I should be the one stabbed. I don't know if he wants to see me and of course I would accept if he didn't want to but I really want to honestly say thank you. Should I visit him? Should I bring him flowers? What can I even say?

"So last week, a young woman approached me (48f) outside my house on a regular middle class neighborhood, to ask if she could charge her mobility scooter. I of course said sure, and offered her to sit inside while she waited. To my surprise, this girl, who I took to be roughly 19-20, was actually 13. She’s taller than I am. She sat around for a while, refused snacks, and eventually asked to spend the night. Multiple times. I gently probed to see if she felt safe at home, and she said she did. So I told her she can’t stay the night (if she’d felt unsafe at home, I’d have made a different decision- maybe CPS?). 
She left after a while. But since then, she keeps coming around. Mostly we catch her on the Ring when no one’s home, but today we were home. I told her I wasn’t well and it’s not a good time, but she came back a couple hours later. I hid. 
I’m aware this girl is probably lonely. But I’m a middle aged woman of a different race (idk if that matters!!!!) and she’s a literal child. It’s not appropriate to let her hang out without her guardian’s knowledge and permission. 
Please help- I don’t know what to do. I was trying to do a good deed for a young adult and somehow managed to get a very young teenager to think she can come into my home whenever she wants. I’m also very much not up to being free babysitter or entertainment for a random kid.

bir süre sonra gitti ama o zamandan beri etrafta dolaşıyor, çoğunlukla evde kimse yokken ringde yakalıyoruz ama bugün evdeydik, ona iyi olmadığımı ve bunun iyi bir zaman olmadığını söyledim ama birkaç saat sonra geri geldi, saklandım

"My (F22) and my boyfriend (M23) have been dating for 3 years now. During this time I have loved him and accepted him for who he is. Lately, somethings have been getting to me. For example, when we want to eat out, he will look for hours while i'm hungry to find the ""perfect"" place, I rarely get to choose. He rarely asks if i am okay when i'm feeling down, he also does not know how to comfort me and it ends up with him talking about himself. I cry alone often and he never notices. If I am on my period and in pain he does not comfort me or hold me unless i ask every single time, and sometimes he says no because he would rather walk around in circles. My love language is physical touch and he only partakes in it when I tell him to or I put myself in his arms. He is obsessed with twitter and will spend hours on it a day. When we are out together, he is almost always scrolling and giggling. When I ask whats funny he will tell me ""its nothing"". He also always has his earphones in listening to some podcast, I often have to repeat myself so he can hear me. In dinner settings (any setting in fact) he does not look me in the eyes because he says its too intense. I know he loves me but the way he does not align with what I need.

"I 15M have a daughter 1F Ellie  and I love her very much but times have been tough. 


My older brother 22M is my legal guardian and I live with him, we are poor and often lack the money for basic needs. 
We both work. When I’m busy I often find a friend that is willing to babysit for a small fee, I feel like I’m neglecting Ellie. 

I don’t know anything about being a dad as this came very suddenly and I am an awful parent. I having a parenting book but other than that I have zero other teachings. 
 
Last school year I didn’t get any sleep. I would bring my daughter into class and she would sleep through it but then be up all night, which meant I was up all night. I don’t know what to do these upcoming years as I still have 2 more years of high school left and she won’t be as easy during class. 

I can’t provide for this little baby but I love her so much. I want her to have a better start at life. I’m not ready to be a father but at the same time i love her. 

I have no idea what I’m doing and I’m so confused and frustrated. 
I never know what to do when she’s crying. I don’t have parental instincts and being raised by an immature teenager is not ideal.

I don’t want to be the reason for someone’s bad childhood. But I don’t want to let go of this poor girl. I just want help. And some serious input.

And so he took her into the bedroom and tried feeding her in there because he thought she was whining because she wanted me, still she kept crying so in the end he just gave her to me and accused me of turning her against him and turning her into a brat and that im a horrible mother for not teaching her right and that if I don't start being a proper mother to her that I wouldn't get the chance to because he would take her and raise her.

"my fiancé and I have been engaged for 3 months. yesterday I found out he’s been cheating on me for 5 months, but he still doesn’t know that I know. Crazy because I had so much trust in him yet he wouldn’t even let me hang out with my friends (MY GIRL-FRIENDS). 

How i found out- He left his phone at home when he left for work. I called his work to let them know i would he dropping it off. The man who answered was confused saying “*name* doesn’t work Fridays?” so we went back and forth for a bit because i was certain he worked fridays. I ended up going on his phone not to even check if he was cheating, just to see where he was so i could give him his phone. Cheating hadn’t even crossed my mind until a text popped up with “ru nearly here;)”. Found out a lot more after that.

We planned to get matching tattoos next week of our names as a wedding promise blablabla (how stupid of me). Appointment is already booked, do I let him get my name tattooed then break the news that I know and leave before getting mine done or is that too childish? Not sure how to handle the situation, i’m heartbroken. 



update: I have posted the messages between me and him/his mom on the text subreddit (check my page)","nişanlım ve ben aylardır nişanlıyız dün aylardır beni aldattığını öğrendim ama hala bunu bilmiyor çılgınca biliyorum çünkü ona çok güveniyordum ama arkadaşlarımla, kız arkadaşlarımla takılmama bile izin vermiyor

"And this is no exaggeration. My aunty is 43, I’m (21) and for as long as I’ve been born, she has always lived upstairs in her childhood bedroom, not liked affection (even like giving someone a hug goodbye, she will leave first to ensure she doesn’t have to), she hates being in photos and always covers up her hair with a scarf, she’s now got long dreadlocks that I don’t think she’s brushed in years &amp; years. But whenever I’ve spoken with her she seems the happiest person ever. My cousins and siblings all called her our “fave aunty” growing up because she’s so fun, kind, smart, and just overall a good person. I asked my mum (her older sister) has she always been like this? Why doesn’t she work? Get a job? Find a husband? As she’s very pretty, smart, kind etc. it’s always confused me why she’s just locked herself away in the sane house she grew up in for so long. My mum said that my aunty went to uni &amp; used to be fun, outgoing, always out with friends etc &amp; then one day she just changed. She was quiet &amp; didn’t speak, I get upset even typing this and I know it’s nosey but I’ve always wanted to know what’s happened. My other aunties have tried to get her a councillor but she refuses and says everything’s fine. She’s had job offers since graduating uni  but just never showed up to them. She still lives with my grandparents who are both 70&amp;80 now &amp; were all getting worried about what she will do in say 10-20 years time? Any advice on what I could do to help her? Or what could be done??","ve bu abartı değil teyzem benim ve ben doğduğumdan beri çocukluğunun geçtiği yatak odasında hep üst katta yaşadı sevgiyi sevmezdi birine sarılmak gibi bir şey bile yapmazdı önce kendisi gitmek zorunda kalmamak için gider fotoğraflarda olmaktan nefret eder ve saçlarını hep bir eşarpla örter şimdi uzun rastaları var sanırım yıllar önce taradığını hatırlamıyorum ama onunla her konuştuğumda gördüğüm en mutlu insan gibi görünüyor kuzenlerim ve kardeşlerim ona çocukken en sevdiğim teyzemiz derdi çünkü çok eğlenceli, nazik, zeki ve genel olarak iyi bir insan anneme sordum ablasına hep böyle miydi neden çalışmıyor iş bulup koca buluyor çünkü çok güzel, akıllı, nazik vs. hep kafamı karıştırdı neden kendini uzun süre büyüdüğü aklı başında evde kilitli tuttuğunu annem teyzemin üniversiteye gittiğini ve eskiden eğlenceli, dışa dönük, her zaman arkadaşlarıyla dışarı çıkan biri olduğunu söyledi sonra bir gün birden değişti sessizleşti ve konuşmuyordu bunu yazarken bile üzülüyorum ve biliyorum ki burnunu sokuyor ama Ne olduğunu her zaman bilmek istedim.

"I'm not sure who to talk to about this so I decided to come on here. So I am a (20) yr old female, and I was raped everyday for 6 years by a family member. Nobody believed or even wanted to listen to me until I attempted suicide. The first time I was touched was in first grade he touched me and made me touch him, and it was just him touching, and kissing me until I got fifth grade. He wanted to show me how much he really loved me, and decided that sex was the best way to do that, and that happened everyday until the middle of my 11th grade year. I've graduated now and been away from him since and I thought I was over it but when I see him front time to time I remember everything all over again like it was yesterday. It's like I can feel him towering over me all over again, and it's been 2 years now since the last time it's happened, but I still have nightmares about it.

"UPDATE!!!!

So I promised I'll try and update everyone, so here goes:

So yesterday I told her I wanted to talk to her about something on Tuesday, but she got really anxious and crampy so I decided to talk to her yesterday night instead.

With all the suggestions I got, I framed a really good message, telling her that I know she's clean, this doesn't change the fact that I like her, assuring her basically. Then I dropped the ball that she might have something going on down there.

Well turns out she knew, she said ever since she got her IUD she has been struggling with BV or other infections, and even after taking pills for it, sometimes it's good for days and sometimes it's bad, no matter how many types she cleans and wash. She also said she knew the last time we had sex it was really horrible and she felt bad. She expected me to bring it up but was appreciative that I didn't ghost her or made her feel bad about it. In general she's going to see her gyne again this week to find a more permanent solution.

That said, I'll probably be abstaining from sex until everything is figured out, I also did wish she let me know about it beforehand, but all In all glad It turned out good.

Also thank you everyone for your help and suggestions, I appreciate it.
For those who thought I didn't know how a woman's vagina smells, or if it was my fault... Well F you !!!!



ORIGINAL 



So a little background, I started talking to this girl about 2-3 weeks ago and it's going well. She smells good, dress good, tall, funny, etc.

 The first night she came over I had to be up early for my travel so we didn't really have sex, just messed around a bit, I didn't really notice any smell so all good. Untill yesterday when she came over again and this time it was all clothes off. Once I took off her undies... My God the smell almost choked me to death, I literally could almost not breathe.

Normally if I meet a girl that has/ does something that throws me off, I'd usually just ghost, but I actually don't wanna do that this time, but I also ABSOLUTELY CANNOT have sex with her with that smell. 

Please how do I tell her nicely that it actually stinks down there, and what can I suggest for it to get better. Thanks ","güncelleme

bu yüzden herkesi güncellemeye çalışacağıma söz verdim, hadi başlayalım

dün ona salı günü bir şey hakkında konuşmak istediğimi söyledim ama çok kaygılı ve kramplıydı bu yüzden dün gece onunla konuşmaya karar verdim

aldığım tüm önerilerle ona temiz olduğunu bildiğimi söyleyen gerçekten iyi bir mesaj çerçeveledim bu onu sevdiğim gerçeğini değiştirmiyor temelde ona güvence verdim sonra orada bir şeyler olabileceği konusunda topu düşürdüm

aslında bildiği ortaya çıktı, rahim içi araç taktırdığından beri BV veya diğer enfeksiyonlarla mücadele ettiğini ve bunun için haplar aldıktan sonra bile bazen günlerce iyi bazen de kötü olduğunu söyledi ne kadar çok temizlerse temizlesin ve yıkasa da ayrıca en son seks yaptığımızda bunun gerçekten korkunç olduğunu ve kendini kötü hissettiğini söyledi, bunu gündeme getirmemi bekliyordu ama onu hayaletlemediğim veya genel olarak kötü hissetmesine neden olmadığım için minnettardı bu hafta daha kalıcı bir çözüm bulmak için tekrar jinekoloğuna gidecek

bununla birlikte her şey çözülene kadar muhtemelen seksten uzak duracağım ayrıca keşke bana izin verseydi önceden biliyordum ama genel olarak iyi sonuçlandığı için mutluyum

ayrıca yardımınız ve önerileriniz için herkese teşekkür ederim, takdir ediyorum
bir kadının vajinasının nasıl koktuğunu bilmediğimi veya bunun benim hatam olup olmadığını düşünenler için, peki s.ktir et

orijinal

bu yüzden biraz geçmiş, haftalar önce bu kızla konuşmaya başladım ve iyi gidiyor, güzel kokuyor, güzel giyiniyor, uzun, komik vb.

ilk geldiği gece seyahatim için erken kalkmak zorunda kaldım, bu yüzden gerçekten seks yapmadık, sadece biraz takıldık, gerçekten hiçbir koku almadım, dün tekrar gelene kadar her şey yolundaydı ve bu sefer her şey yolundaydı, iç çamaşırlarını çıkardığımda tanrım koku beni neredeyse boğacak kadar boğuyordu, kelimenin tam anlamıyla nefes alamıyordum

normalde beni rahatsız eden bir şey yapan bir kızla karşılaştığımda genellikle sadece hayalet gibi davranırım ama aslında bu sefer bunu yapmak istemiyorum ama ayrıca o koku varken onunla kesinlikle seks yapamam

lütfen ona orasının gerçekten koktuğunu nasıl güzelce söyleyebilirim ve düzelmesi için ne önerebilirim, teşekkürler"
"UPDATE available here: https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway_wknds/s/PsiT333W5o

Hey everyone, lurker here. I’ve tried posting this from a different account however it did not work so I hope this works.

I’ve (35M) been with my beautiful wife (34F) for close to 10 years. We have no kids as of now. My wife’s best friend, Amy has been friends with my wife for about 15 years, all throughout college where I originally met my wife. 

Me and Amy haven’t ever been the best of friends however we’ve been cordial for the sake of my wife. I’ve always found her to be obnoxious, loud and entitled. The kind that inserts herself into any and every conversation, whether that be on a night out with friends or a private conversation. For example, myself and my best friend were talking about fertility issues in his marriage during a dinner with our long time friends, we were quiet enough so that nobody could hear us over the chatter yet she found a way to be nosy and make a comment on how she would “kill herself” if she couldn’t do the one thing a woman was made to do. This pissed off my best friend, Max and his wife to the point where they excused themselves and left early to go home.  

Now onto the actual situation at hand. Amy’s boyfriend, Khalid had left her due to her annoying personality. I think it was more of a build up but what set him off was when Amy purposely did not feed their dog while he was on a work trip because he was sleeping while she was drunk and calling him to collect her. That’s only the tip of the iceberg. 

Amy has always been weird with me. She has constantly tried to DM me on Instagram, trying to make conversation about gossip in our friend group or completely random things. I have always ignored her. My wife has always seen past her strange behaviour, she refused to believe her dearest best friend would have ill intentions. 

Anyway, after their break up, Amy came over to our house to see my wife. My wife was feeling ill on this day so she took pills to help her sleep and fell asleep in a matter of an hour. I could not ask Amy to leave in the state she was in so for my wife I suggested she could sleep in the guest bedroom. She agreed and went to bed. I was in the kitchen cleaning up after dinner and she waltzed into the kitchen with nothing but under garments on. She acted shocked and claimed she didn’t know i was still in the kitchen. I felt extremely uncomfortable and decided to call it a night. However, she started stripping and approaching me, telling me how my wife doesn’t have to know and she’s “seen the way i’ve looked at her”.

I was completely baffled and told her she’s gotten the wrong idea and to be ashamed to do this to her own best friend while I try to scurry out of the kitchen. However she practically leaped in front of me and touched my private’s. Without a second thought, I hit her. I know I could have easily pushed her but in the moment I panicked and punched her in the face. Her eye was left bruised. She started wailing, enough that my wife woke up and stumbled in the kitchen to see her best friend, naked and bruised. 

She then went on about how I “tried to rape her” and that I’m a disgusting human being and she should divorce me. I snapped back that she approached me, naked and a rejection wasn’t enough for her to back off so I punched her, hence the bruise. My wife didn’t say anything. Instead she fainted and I immediately brought her to the hospital. 

My wife is now okay but refuses to talk to me about what happened. On the other hand, Amy has now accused me of attempting to have sex with her in our friend group. The majority of people don’t believe her but there’s a few who live by always believe a rape accusation. The other half told me I fucked up by punching her and fueling this anger. 

Amy has ruined my life. I’m afraid my wife will divorce me and this goes to court. I’ve already contemplated suicide many times. I don’t know where to go from here.

EDIT: I know this story sounds absurd and I wish it were fake but it is not. The unnecessary details were brought in to point an overall picture of her character. I guess it is worth mentioning my wife feels like she owes her life to Amy for getting her out of an abusive household when they were teenagers. They are practically like sisters. Amy was also not drunk.

EDIT 2: 

EDIT 2: A few things I would like to clarify to avoid confusion:

1. Amy claims to have gone to the kitchen to get a glass of water not knowing I was still there. She then claims I took advantage of her.

2. This incident happened at approximately 3AM. It is now 8AM.

3. She came up with this story and posted it in our group chat right after she went back home. 

4. Majority of our friend group have to get up early for their responsibilities hence how this misinformation has spread like wildfire. I have been getting individuals DMs on advice and opinions since where I’ve concluded the majority are on my side, some say I shouldn’t have punched her and the rest believe her. 

5. My wife has been up all night and refuses to talk to me. I have not tried to push her to talk to me. For now, she needs time to process it. ","update available here httpswwwredditcomuthrowawaywkndsspsitwo

"She hosted a small reunion at our place yesterday. Her best friend, who I will call 'Kelly', was here. Also their other friends from college.

They got pretty tipsy, with my mom getting much more drunk than the others. During discussion about sex, mom blurted out 'You know, Kelly, your son eats pussy really well.' Kelly and the others were sober enough to grasp what my mom was saying. I poked her shoulder, trying to get her to stop, but she didn't. She went on 'His dick's not too good though,' before passing out. Her friends all left.

Now my mom is wondering why none of them will answer her calls or messages. She asked me what happened when she was drunk and if she has somehow offended them. How the hell do I tell her what happened last night? Should I even tell her or do I wait for Kelly to confront her about it?","dün bizim evde küçük bir buluşma düzenledi en yakın arkadaşı, kelly diyeceğim, ayrıca üniversiteden diğer arkadaşları da buradaydı

Annem seks hakkında konuşurken diğerlerinden çok daha fazla sarhoş olduğu için oldukça sarhoş oldular, annem ağzından kaçırdı, bilirsin kelly, oğlun gerçekten çok iyi am yiyor kelly ve diğerleri annem ne dediğini anlayacak kadar ayıktı, onu durdurmaya çalışarak omzunu dürttüm ama durdurmadı, onun penisine girdi, çok iyi olmasa da bayılmadan önce arkadaşları gitti

şimdi annem neden hiçbiri aramalarına veya mesajlarına cevap vermiyor diye merak ediyor, sarhoşken ne olduğunu sordu ve eğer onları bir şekilde gücendirdiyse dün gece ne olduğunu ona nasıl anlatacağımı, ona anlatmalı mıyım yoksa kelly'nin onunla yüzleşmesini mi beklemeliyim"
"I honestly don’t even know where to start the story. I’ll keep the long story short. Me and my partner have been together for almost a year now and he (27 M) tested positive for gonorrhea while we were on my (20 F) birthday vacation together. He told me his ex gave it to him in the past before and said it’s a reoccurring thing now. I don’t believe him but I also don’t believe he would cheat on me at the same time. I’m confused and conflicted about what to do. 
I’m not having any symptoms myself but I am going to go get tested officially this week. 
If anyone has any advice or knowledge on if what he’s saying is true please tell me. 
Thank y’all 

Edit: he cheated 

Edit 2: so I listened to yall and my gut so I went through his phone. He’s been on dating apps and was having sex with other women AND men without condoms. I just left the dr today and should get my results on Friday. 
I packed all my things and left him that very night. He stayed I was crazy and overreacting. He also asked me everyday of the trip if we could find a girl to “have fun with”

And to answer some of yalls questions. I have not been having symptoms. And he told me about the possibility of him having it before our trip but I thought it was just a urethra infection. He got conformation while we were on vacation from his dr. 6 hours away from home. I left him the night we came back. 


Thank you guys so much for all the love and support you have given me. I will update again when I get results and if anything extra happens. ","dürüst olmak gerekirse hikayeye nereden başlayacağımı bile bilmiyorum uzun hikayeyi kısa tutacağım partnerimle neredeyse bir yıldır birlikteyiz ve doğum günü tatilimizdeyken bel soğukluğu testi pozitif çıktı, bana eski sevgilisinin daha önce ona bulaştırdığını ve bunun tekrarlayan bir şey olduğunu söyledi, şimdi ona inanmıyorum ama aynı zamanda beni aldatacağına da inanmıyorum ne yapacağım konusunda kafam karışık ve çelişkiliyim

"My (F26) boyfriend (M33) will pull or squeeze my nipples pretty hard when he sees them through my shirt or when we're cuddling. It's actually gone to him fully biting them now. I think he just trying to be playful, he likes to bug me by doing dumb stuff to me but this one I just genuinely hate and it hurts alot. I've told him multiple times I hate it but I think that makes him want to do it more. I'm just not sure how to get it through to him that it's not funny or being playful and it just hurts me. ","erkek arkadaşım gömleğimin altından gördüğünde veya sarılırken meme uçlarımı sertçe çekiyor veya sıkıyor, artık tamamen ısırıyor, sanırım sadece şaka yapmaya çalışıyor, bana aptalca şeyler yaparak beni rahatsız etmeyi seviyor ama bundan gerçekten nefret ediyorum ve çok canım yanıyor. Ona bundan nefret ettiğimi defalarca söyledim ama sanırım bu onu daha çok yapmak istiyor, sadece ona bunun komik olmadığını veya şaka olmadığını ve sadece canımı acıttığını nasıl anlatacağımı bilmiyorum."
"I am 17 and my boyfriend is 18, we have been together for 2 months. My parents decided to search through my room and my bags while I was at work and they found condoms and lube in my room. My mom texted me saying that my relationship will be over and I am not allowed to go anywhere with him anymore unless we stay at the house. But I know that he will never be allowed over anymore. My parents took all my condoms and pregnancy tests, then told me if I get pregnant they will kick me out of the house because they aren’t raising my baby. My dad said he is so ashamed of me he can’t even look at me and I feel like this whole thing is an overreaction. I don’t understand their thought process of thinking taking away all my protection will stop it or make the situation any better. They’ve always been ones to shame me and make fun of my body and clothes, never taught me anything about sex or periods etc. I’ve learned it all my self. I can’t even talk to them because it always results in shaming me. Months ago my parents found lube in my room that I used to put in tampons and they stole it and then removed my doorknob so they can “see what I’m doing” in my own room. And I’m at the point where I want to move out. I have 2 jobs and I think that if I work more and grind a lot I will be able to move out and into an apartment with a roommate. My boyfriend also told me about this website called nesterly. Any advice on how to talk or deal with my parents? Because they have been like this my entire life ","ben ve erkek arkadaşım aylardır birlikteyiz. annem ve babam ben işteyken odamı ve çantalarımı aramaya karar verdiler ve odamda prezervatif ve kayganlaştırıcı buldular. annem bana ilişkimin bittiğini ve artık onunla hiçbir yere gitmeme izin vermediğini, ancak evde kalmamız gerektiğini söyledi ama bir daha asla eve gelmesine izin verilmeyeceğini biliyorum. annem ve babam tüm prezervatiflerimi ve hamilelik testlerimi aldı ve hamile kalırsam bebeğimi büyütmedikleri için beni evden atacaklarını söylediler. babam benden çok utandığını ve bana bakamadığını söyledi ve tüm bunların aşırı tepki olduğunu düşünüyorum. tüm korumamı kaldırmanın bunu durduracağını veya durumu daha iyi hale getireceğini düşünme süreçlerini anlamıyorum. beni utandıran ve vücudumla ve kıyafetlerimle dalga geçenler hep onlar oldu. bana seks veya adet dönemi vb. hakkında hiçbir şey öğretmediler. her şeyi kendi kendime öğrendim. onlarla konuşamıyorum bile çünkü bu her zaman beni utandırmakla sonuçlanıyor. aylar önce annem ve babam odamda tamponlara koyduğum kayganlaştırıcı buldular ve onu çaldılar ve sonra kapı kolumu söktüler. Kendi odamda ne yaptığımı görebiliyorlar ve artık taşınmak istediğim noktadayım. İşlerim var ve daha çok çalışırsam ve çok çalışırsam dışarı çıkıp bir oda arkadaşımla bir daireye taşınabileceğimi düşünüyorum. Erkek arkadaşım da bana Nesterly adlı bir web sitesinden bahsetti. Ailemle nasıl konuşacağım veya onlarla nasıl başa çıkacağım konusunda herhangi bir tavsiyeniz var mı çünkü onlar tüm hayatım boyunca böyleydi."
"My wife has been try for a while to lose weight she gained  over 2 pregnancies, and ever since the 2nd delivery she has been about 50 lbs overweight. She is no longer breastfeeding and kids are sleeping well now, and our life is pretty stable.

She often mentions that she wants to lose weight and has tried a few things off and on like noom, my fitness pal, but is not very consistent.

She does a lot of things that I feel are incompatible with losing weight. After eating a normal sized dinner where she serves the same portion that I eat (I am naturally skinny, and not trying to lose weight), she will frequently have a late snack around 8:30  or 9 like a bowl of cereal, piece of toast, or ice cream. 

She also does not seem be able to deal with any amount of hunger. She has made comments like ""I need a snack before dinner, all I ate for lunch was an apple, a bowl of yogurt with Granola, and cheese with crackers"". To me that sounds like an adequate lunch for someone who is trying to cut calories.

A few years ago when she was on a diet and I remarked about her having a late night snack she got very and defensive about it. Saying she knows, but has to have something to settle her stomach.

She also likes to bake and make tasty treats, and will make ice cream or cookies, or other things and involve our kids which is cute, but then we have a bunch of sweets around the house. And she has a sweet tooth.

I try to be supportive. I haven't made any comments since that one a few years ago. I cook healthy dinners like chicken or fish with lots of veggies. But I feel like she is always setting herself up for failure. Also diet advice from a naturally tall skinny dude is impossible to be empathetic. 

But after making a nice healthy dinner and then seeing her eat a big bowl of cereal 3 hours later makes me want to say some snarky remarks about why she isn't loosing weight.

Anyone have a similar experience?
Anything useful I could say?
Or should I just continue to hold my tongue?","eşim bir süredir hamilelikler sırasında aldığı kiloları vermeye çalışıyor ve doğumdan beri yaklaşık 1000 kilo fazla kilolu, artık emzirmiyor ve çocuklar artık iyi uyuyor ve hayatımız oldukça istikrarlı

sık sık kilo vermek istediğini söylüyor ve ara sıra birkaç şey denedi, örneğin fitness arkadaşım noom ama çok tutarlı değil

normal büyüklükte bir akşam yemeği yedikten sonra kilo vermekle bağdaşmadığını düşündüğüm birçok şey yapıyor, benim yediğim porsiyonla aynı porsiyonu servis ediyor, doğal olarak zayıfım ve kilo vermeye çalışmıyorum, sık sık geç saatlerde bir şeyler atıştırıyor veya bir kase mısır gevreği, bir parça tost veya dondurma gibi

ayrıca açlıkla başa çıkamıyor gibi görünüyor, akşam yemeğinden önce bir şeyler atıştırmam gerektiği gibi yorumlarda bulunuyor, öğle yemeğinde yediğim tek şey bir elma, granola ve peynirle bir kase yoğurt ve krakerdi, bana göre bu kalorileri azaltmaya çalışan biri için yeterli bir öğle yemeği gibi geliyor

birkaç yıl önce diyet yaparken ve gece geç saatlerde bir şeyler atıştırdığını söylediğimde çok savunmacı davrandı ve şöyle dedi o biliyor ama midesini yatıştıracak bir şeye ihtiyacı var

ayrıca pişirmeyi ve lezzetli ikramlar yapmayı seviyor ve dondurma veya kurabiye veya başka şeyler yapıyor ve çocuklarımızı da dahil ediyor ki bu çok tatlı ama sonra evde bir sürü tatlı oluyor ve o da tatlıya düşkün

destekleyici olmaya çalışıyorum birkaç yıl önce yaptığım yorumdan beri hiçbir yorum yapmadım tavuk veya balık gibi bol sebzeli sağlıklı akşam yemekleri pişiriyorum ama sanki kendini her zaman başarısızlığa hazırlıyormuş gibi hissediyorum ayrıca doğal olarak uzun ve zayıf bir adamın diyet tavsiyelerine empati duymak imkansız

ama güzel ve sağlıklı bir akşam yemeği yaptıktan sonra saatler sonra onu büyük bir kase mısır gevreği yerken görmek bana neden kilo veremediği hakkında alaycı yorumlar yapmak istiyor

benzer bir deneyim yaşayan var mı
söyleyebileceğim faydalı bir şey var mı

"My (18f) friend (17f) broke up with her boyfriend (26m). I’ve had a lot of family issues recently and haven’t had much time to keep up with my friends. Especially this friend as she dates around a lot. 

She sent the ss of their breakup to our gc and I happened to have a free minute to read them over. The guys said his friends were telling him he should wait til she’s 18 and he told her he has shit going on in his life so they should break up for the time being.

I don’t think what I responded with was terribly harsh but Idk: “I’m gonna be completely honest ‘friend’ and please do not take this as an insult to you bc it’s not you whatsoever, this guy is a grown adult, not only is he acting immature, he’s dating a minor. It’s not okay and I’m glad you guys broke up, it sucks but it’s what’s better in the long run”

In the past said friend has been really touchy about all things boys and anytime you try to talk some sense into her she ignores it or pretends to take your advice and then doesn’t use it.

After I sent that she responded: “It’s legal I’m not a minor anymore x” and yeah whilst where we live the age of consent is 16, I still told her it was icky and this grown man should know better. 

She left the gc and hasn’t spoken to me since. That was a few months ago, she didn’t even wish me a happy birthday last week when I turned 18. 

Idk what to do.","f arkadaşım f erkek arkadaşıyla ayrıldı m son zamanlarda çok fazla ailevi sorun yaşadım ve özellikle bu arkadaşımla çok fazla görüştüğüm için arkadaşlarımla ilgilenmeye pek vaktim olmadı

bunu gönderdikten sonra cevap verdi, yasal ben değilim küçük artık x ve evet yaşadığımız yerde reşit olma yaşı olmasına rağmen ona bunun iğrenç olduğunu ve bu yetişkin adamın daha iyisini bilmesi gerektiğini söyledim

"i’m 19 and my mom has been posting photos of me onto her facebook for practically my entire life. at first it started off as just cute little moments but as i’ve gotten older it’s become out of hand. she’s posted photos of me that she’s taken while i’m not looking, while i’m at doctors appointments, while i’m eating, and has even made posts telling people where i work. mind you, her facebook is public, so anyone could see these things. i’ve spoken to her about this before but her take on it is that she’s my mother and therefore she can post whatever she wants of me. i’m not sure what to do or how to get through to her. i don’t want to do anything crazy like take legal action, i just want her to listen to me and respect my boundaries. what do i do?","Annem ve ben hayatım boyunca facebook'ta benim fotoğraflarımı paylaşıyordu.

"I (24f) have just learned that my roommate’s girlfriend has been posting videos of herself pissing in different spots in our apartment. She also lives with us and has for over two years. Originally our house had 7 people (we live in a college town and most of us are friends since childhood) but a few days ago, three of my roommates made the decision to move to California together to pursue their careers as artists. I just got married and am about to move out myself into my first house with my husband. A lot of us were gunning for our deposits back (500 per person) as we’re all starting a new chapter in our lives but I don’t think we’ll be getting it back. My roommate and her girlfriend (24f and 23f respectively) have always had an issue with their bedroom smelling like piss. They have a dog that gets taken out twice a day, if that, who almost always pees on the carpet as soon as she leaves her crate. Normally when you walk into their room, there’s a pee pad on the ground for the dog. But recently me and my best friend (another roommate) found her twitter page. The first video is her msterbating and then peeing in her car. Whatever. My friends and I are all queer, and sexually liberated. We don’t kink shame. This girl has been making money off videos on her twitter page since she e first met her. She even got paid big money to stomp on some guy’s balls. So this initially wasn’t upsetting. What made it upsetting was finding the videos of her peeing into cups from our kitchen, peeing onto her carpet in the apartment and peeing off the washing machine onto the floor in the SHARED laundry room. This made me furious. It wasn’t just a little amount of pee either. I’m talking she held it in all day and waiting for this. There’s even a video of her in her work bathroom, peeing on the floor, IN UNIFORM. She was a manager at a pizza place in our town. She’s peed in their bed, and on their blankets. My roommate’s mattress cost $1000 as it was a gift from her parents and her girlfriend pissed all over it. 
The issue I need help with is that our other roommates are unaware. And nobody wants to tell them. My bestfriend doesn’t want to hurt my roommate who’s dating the pisser and my roommate won’t tell because the friends that moved away already didn’t like her girlfriend. I think they deserve to know. But I don’t know how to handle this situation.

"My gf and I, plus our friend A and her gf B, (we are all women in wlw relationships) were having a conversation about rape kinks. My gf and I were voicing our concerns with rape kinks specifically. (Now we were not kink shaming anyone, just bringing up the fact that coercion into that kink could be dangerous, and the coercion into sex in general is rape.) This is when B admitted that she got a straight woman incapacitated via drugs and alcohol, and “made her move” on the woman. B said while sober she came up with this idea, to get the woman so incapacitated to the point of passing out. B claims this is part of her kink, she wants to have sex with people who don’t move/talk. This is when my gf and I were trying to give her an out, because we didn’t want to believe A was ok with this behavior, but B wouldn’t take it. A soon after left the room and said it was a “weird conversation she didn’t want to be a part of”, this comment combined with A’s uncomfortable response made me think that this could be happening to her as well.

"My daughter is 12 and this school year became friends with a girl that is a bad influence. Prior to this she had a pretty large friend group and they were all very nice and doing well in school. This new girl, I'll call her B, gets grounded constantly, and in trouble at school all the time. My daughter recently got in trouble for calling a girl a name at school and because of this I looked through her phone messages. The things on there were horrible. 

At the beginning all the bullying messages were coming from B talking about other kids at school but over the last 6 months my daughter slowly joined in until her messages were almost as bad. B also has a lot of messages alluding to sex and alcohol and thankfully my daughter doesn't have any messages like that. I don't know if I should stop her from seeing B as much as possible or let her figure it out on her own so she learns from this. I would let her figure it out but it's at the point where it's interfering with school. To make matters worse my daughter's old friend group saw B for what she is and refused to be friends with my daughter if they remain friends. So my daughter basically ditched all of her friends for a few people that are bringing her down in so many ways. After a long discussion with my daughter she will be starting therapy but I don't know what else to do.","kızım ve bu okul yılında kötü bir etkisi olan bir kızla arkadaş oldu bundan önce oldukça büyük bir arkadaş grubu vardı ve hepsi çok iyiydi ve okulda iyi gidiyorlardı bu yeni kıza b diyeceğim sürekli cezalandırılıyor ve okulda sürekli başı belaya giriyor kızım yakın zamanda okulda bir kıza isim taktığı için başı belaya girdi ve bu yüzden telefon mesajlarına baktım oradaki şeyler korkunçtu

"My [29] husband [29] has kept around another woman. I am rethinking our marriage.

Tldr at the bottom.

We met when we were 11 and started a relationship almost immediately. Very young, I know. We got married at 18.

My husband comes from a very religious family. My family and I are not religious. But this has never been a problem between the two of us. In my mind, he is culturally religious, as he doesn't pray or attend mosque unless there is religious occasions (like weddings and funerals), but he does celebrate Eid and participates in Ramadan. I fast with him in support and I've helped raise money for charities for the needy in his parent's home country.

When we were 15, his parents found out about our relationship. They did not approve of me and immediately set out to find a match for my husband with someone that was of their faith and nationality.

At our wedding they brought this other girl. She was the opposite of me in almost every way, an ideal bride. My husband said it didn't matter as we were together.

I was worried this would effect us, but my husband reassured me it would not. To be clear, my husband has always stuck by me and defended me against his family. On occasions I didn't want to attend events or trips because of them, he has been very understanding.

I supported my husband into a career that is very lucrative. His father wanted him to join his business, and he was basically kicked out of the house at 16 for defying them. He lived with my family and then we moved in together.
The jump into this new career paid off immediately and my husband has been supporting me through my education, and on the side I am a housewife. We both grew up poor, so his job has changed things for everyone. He also has helped my family and his family, including buying homes for them, paying for our siblings educations, holidays, etc.

His family, of course, forgave him, but his parents still treat me very coldly. His younger siblings are very kind, though, and I am very close with his younger sister. I'm not close to his older brother and sister.

I have had bad luck with my health. I won't divulge too much but it was a childhood illness, now a chronic illness on top of a life long mental health diagnosis.

Last year was our 10 year anniversary and my in-laws brought the woman they wanted my husband to marry. She is still very beautiful and I was told she had just graduated from a prestigious university in her home country. I brought this up to my sister-in-law in passing, last week, during a casual conversation, and she revealed that my husband had paid for the woman's education and was living in an apartment he had bought for he in the city where she lived. Their parents apparently have a good relationship with her. I was shocked. 

My sister-in-law tried to reassure me it was nothing, that my husband was just a kind man. But I couldn't feel comfortable with it, so I confronted him.

He told me that when we were 15, when his parents found out about us, he was forced to promise to break up with me from threat of being sent to live with family abroad. They also threatened to disown him when they kicked him out at 16 as he had essentially chosen me over them.

After begining his career, in order to allow him to rebuild their relationship, he had to promise to support this girl they'd picked out for him. He thought his parents would relent eventually and warm up to me but that has not happened. And though they acknowledge we're married, they said it wouldn't work out and he'd have this girl instead.

He made a throwaway comment at this time saying she was only there just in case soemthing happened. There was a time not long after he started his career that I got very sick. And he explained that there were times they thought I wouldn't come back from it. He tried to joke that she was just a backup bride.

He doesn't understand why this upset me so much. That I felt I had committed myself to him for life but he had this other woman on hand just in case. He has supported me through everything and, my health permitting, I have done the same.

He tried to reassure me that it wasn't his plan and while he did give money, he didn't know the woman personally. He just wanted a relationship with his family. 
While I can appreciate he wasn't the architect, it still hurts that, if anything happened, she is still right there.

I tried to ask him if he'd marry her if I did become too ill and he refused to answer. To me that says enough. But he got angry when I tried to persist, saying he'd sacrificed a lot for me. And this is definitely true, but I've sacrificed things too.

It's been a few days and I can't move past it. He can't even explain why he never told me. He just keeps saying he didn't want me to be upset, that I wasn't supposed to find out. That I'm delicate. 

He keeps on trying to reconcile and move past it. But I am struggling. He flips between placating me and snapping at me.

I'm seriously rethinking our whole marriage. We've been through our ups and downs but even at our worst, I have never thought about leaving. For me it's only been him. Maybe, in his mind it's different because my illnesses made things less permanent. But my current health problems aren't time sensitive. They can be up or down. I don't know.


 I need advice. I'm spiralling a bit.


Tldr: My husband picked me over an arranged marriage. To keep his family in his life, he agreed to pay for this other woman's education and lifestyle. Due to my multiple illnesses, they see her as a backup in case I passed away or become incapacitated due to my mental health.","my  husband  has kept around another woman i am rethinking our marriage

tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var, biraz daraldım

kısa özet: kocam ailesini hayatında tutmak için ayarlanmış bir evlilik yerine beni seçti, birden fazla hastalığım olduğu için bu diğer kadının eğitimini ve yaşam tarzını ödemeyi kabul etti, ruh sağlığım nedeniyle ölürsem veya sakat kalırsam onu ​​yedek olarak görüyorlar"
"So a few nights ago my boyfriend fell asleep with his phone unlocked, he’d been acting weird with me all week and I didn’t know why so I took this opportunity to have a snoop. I know it’s wrong but I couldn’t help myself.

I didn’t find anything as to why he was being off with me but on his browser history was onlyfans. I’ve never ever been bothered about him watching porn or masturbating but I did feel abit weird about him paying for it so I had a look around the profile. It turns out, he was subscribed to 2 of my friends who do only fans as well as my younger sister (24f). Not only that, he’d been subscribed on and off to the 2 friends since 2019. Despite having a fake name on there obviously he can’t deny it’s him as it’s his card details that are saved.
This obviously shocked me to my core because why would he be paying for this? He speaks SO negatively about them doing onlyfans but he pays to see them do it? He literally owes me over £1,000 that he never has enough money in the month to start paying me back but is paying to see people we know doing porn? We are literally so poor but he has money to spare for this? And literally the fact that it’s my SISTER??!!! 
We have an 18 month old son and live together so breaking up isn’t going to be easy but is this even a worthy thing to break up over?
I’m so hurt by this and I don’t know what to do, I’ve just been pretending everything is normal but it’s all I keep thinking about. I don’t even know where to begin if I brought it up to him.
The thought of breaking up terrifies me because I think who’s going to love me, a single mum? And who’s going to love both me and my son together?
I know it’s my own fault for looking and I obviously wish now that I hadn’t.
We’ve had issues in the past with him lying about stupid things and being snakey and I just always think he is eventually going to cheat on me and I might as well end it now before he does?
He’s all I’ve known for 10 years and he’s been my first everything. I just need some advice or reassurance. i don’t even know. 
I don’t even want to tell people i know in case I get too scared to break up with him. :(


EDIT: thank you so much for all the advice and support, it truly is really appreciated since I had no where else to turn. It’s opened my eyes further to how bad this is and I can’t believe I was questioning whether it’s a good enough reason to break up. I wish I was someone who was good at confrontation but I’m not. I’m thinking of bringing it up to him when the time is right and depending on how he reacts, just telling him I no longer want to be together. However, I do want to try and be as civil as possible for the sake of our son and suggest we try to be friends at least when we’re both infront of him. He’s told me before he is never leaving this house which is what I’m dreading so I will ask my mum in advance if I can stay with her and give him a couple of days to leave. I’m sure he doesn’t want his family &amp; friends to know the reason why we broke up so I’m hoping he will be cooperative in this situation. Overall I’m just heartbroken and embarrassed and I honestly don’t want to break up a 10 year relationship but I know we have to, I don’t see there being any coming back from this. I will update again after i have told him. Thank you all again.","birkaç gece önce erkek arkadaşım telefonunun kilidi açıkken uyuyakaldı, bütün hafta boyunca bana karşı garip davranıyordu ve nedenini bilmiyordum, bu yüzden bu fırsatı değerlendirip onu gizlice izledim, bunun yanlış olduğunu biliyordum ama kendimi tutamadım

neden benimle ilgilendiğine dair hiçbir şey bulamadım ama tarayıcı geçmişinde onlyfans vardı, porno izlemesi veya mastürbasyon yapması beni hiç rahatsız etmedi ama bunun için ödeme yapması konusunda biraz garip hissettim, bu yüzden profile bir göz attım, only fans yapan arkadaşlarımın ve küçük kız kardeşimin abonesi olduğunu gördüm, sadece bu değil, friends'e ara sıra abone olmuştu, çünkü orada sahte bir isim olmasına rağmen, kart bilgileri kaydedildiği için bunun kendisi olduğunu inkar edemez
bu beni derinden sarstı çünkü neden bunun için ödeme yapsın ki, onlyfans yapmaları hakkında çok olumsuz konuşuyor ama bunu yapmalarını görmek için ödeme yapıyor, bana bunun için tam anlamıyla borçlu, bana geri ödeme yapmaya başlamak için ayda asla yeterli parası olmuyor ama tanıdığımız insanların porno yapmasını izlemek için ödeme yapıyor, biz tam anlamıyla çok fakiriz ama bunun için harcayacak parası var ve kelimenin tam anlamıyla kız kardeşim olması
bir aylık oğlumuz var ve birlikte yaşıyoruz bu yüzden ayrılmak kolay olmayacak ama bu ayrılmaya değer bir şey mi
bu beni çok üzdü ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum sadece her şeyin normalmiş gibi davranıyorum ama tek düşündüğüm bu ona konuyu açtıysam nereden başlayacağımı bile bilmiyorum
ayrılma düşüncesi beni korkutuyor çünkü bekar bir anne olarak beni kim sevecek ve hem beni hem de oğlumu birlikte kim sevecek diye düşünüyorum
baktığım için bunun benim hatam olduğunu biliyorum ve şimdi keşke yapmasaydım diyorum
geçmişte onun aptalca şeyler hakkında yalan söylemesi ve sinsi olmasıyla ilgili sorunlarımız oldu ve her zaman sonunda beni aldatacağını düşünüyorum ve bunu yapmadan önce bunu bitirsem iyi olur
yıllardır tanıdığım tek kişi o ve benim ilk her şeyim oldu sadece biraz tavsiyeye veya güvenceye ihtiyacım var bilmiyorum bile
tanıdığım insanlara bile söylemek istemiyorum çünkü onunla ayrılmaktan çok korkarım

düzenle her şey için çok teşekkür ederim tavsiye ve destek gerçekten çok takdir edildi çünkü gidecek başka bir yerim yoktu gözlerimi daha da açtı bunun ne kadar kötü olduğunu ve ayrılmak için yeterince iyi bir sebep olup olmadığını sorguladığıma inanamıyorum keşke yüzleşmede iyi biri olsaydım ama değilim zamanı geldiğinde bunu ona açmayı düşünüyorum ve tepkisine bağlı olarak artık birlikte olmak istemediğimi ancak oğlumuzun hatırına olabildiğince medeni olmaya çalışmak istiyorum ve en azından ikimiz de onun önünde olduğumuzda arkadaş olmayı denememizi öneriyorum daha önce bana bu evden asla çıkmayacağını söyledi bu yüzden anneme onunla kalıp ona gitmesi için birkaç gün verebilir miyim diye soracağım eminim ailesinin ve arkadaşlarının neden ayrıldığımızı bilmesini istemiyordur bu yüzden bu durumda işbirlikçi olmasını umuyorum genel olarak sadece kalbim kırık ve utanıyorum ve dürüst olmak gerekirse bir yıllık ilişkimizi bitirmek istemiyorum ama yapmamız gerektiğini biliyorum bundan geri dönüş olacağını düşünmüyorum ona söyledikten sonra tekrar güncelleyeceğim hepinize tekrar teşekkür ederim"
"I, 19F, can’t sleep when my brother, 14, plays his video games at night. Its every. single. night like this without fail. He plays until 2, 3, 4 in the morning and I am never able to sleep. Its gotten so bad that on weekends, I lay all day in my bed, on college days, I fall asleep in the bus, on the train and in class. 

I’ve told my parents and they both say that if they can’t hear him and aren’t disturbed by it then it’s not as bad as I’m making it out to be. The thing is their room is a few doors down from my room and my brothers room, so of course they won’t be able to hear it.

Every time I tell my dad, he yells at me and tells me that I don’t have to sleep as much as I say I need. I sleep with noise cancelling headphones on and play light music but I can still hear him through it. I also have tinnitus so I can’t play the music too loud to drown him out anyway. 

I can’t live like this anymore and currently, no, there is nowhere else for me to go. I’m in college and even with my job I couldn’t afford to move out just yet.

Any advice?","Kardeşim geceleri video oyunları oynarken uyuyamıyorum, her gece istisnasız sabaha kadar oynuyor ve ben hiç uyuyamıyorum, o kadar kötü oldu ki hafta sonları bütün gün yatağımda yatıyorum, üniversite günlerimde otobüste, trende ve sınıfta uyuyakalıyorum

Annemle babama söyledim ve ikisi de eğer onu duyamıyorlarsa ve bundan rahatsız olmuyorlarsa bunun benim anlattığım kadar kötü olmadığını söylediler, mesele şu ki onların odası benim odamdan ve kardeşimin odasından birkaç kapı ötede, bu yüzden tabii ki duyamayacaklar

Babama her söylediğimde bana bağırıyor ve bana ihtiyacım olduğunu söylediğim kadar uyumam gerekmediğini söylüyor, gürültü önleyici kulaklık takıp hafif müzik dinliyorum ama yine de onu duyabiliyorum ayrıca kulak çınlaması da var, bu yüzden onu bastırmayacak kadar yüksek sesle müzik çalamıyorum zaten

Artık böyle yaşayamam ve şu anda gidebileceğim başka bir yer yok, üniversitedeyim ve işim olsa bile evden taşınacak param yok henüz

"Me (26F) and my Fiancé (28M) have been together for 3 years and engaged for 1. During the first month of our relationship he shared to me that he was bi and that he has previous relations with men in the past. I am also bi and thought it would be hypocritical to view him any different so I’ve accepted it. After about 4 months together he introduced the idea of a 3sum with another guy. I was reluctant at first but eventually gave in for the experience. During the encounter my fiance gave the other guy head and he wanted us to do it together. I felt very uneasy during and after that but never told him that I was. The 3sums really turned him on and we continued to do them at least 1x-2x a month with different guys. The first 3sum was the only time he had given head during it…until yesterday. We decided to do another 3sum but this time was different. He decided to give this give this guy head. after he was finished I started sucking them both at the same time when the other guy decided to get behind my fiancé and from what I could tell he was penetrating him. I felt so sick to my stomach I had to stop and told them I wasn’t feeling well. I asked my Fiancé after he left if that’s what happened and he was very adamant that it didn’t happen. It was dark in the room so I wasn’t sure if my eyes were deceiving me.

Seeing my fiance possibly being penetrated by another man has left me questioning everything. Does this make me homophobic?  I do enjoy the 3sums sometimes, but im not sure why I have these feelings during them. Any advice  would be helpful 

Edit: To mention my Fiancé has a cuckhold Kink and fetishized His wife being pounded by another man. He watches a lot of porn pertaining to that (which I don’t mind) but likes to act them out in RL. 

UPDATE: so after reading everyone’s replies and taking some time to myself to actually think about this, I’ve come to the conclusion that I was just jealous seeing him with another person. The feeling that I felt while witnessing it was different because the actions was performed on a man, but I quickly realize that jealousy is universal. I talked to my fiancé after seeing some suggestions that communication is/was needed (in which I apologized to him for lacking) . He reassured me that he was not penetrated because I would know immediately since he never has been and that he just likes to give/receive head. I also remembered bringing up pegging in the beginning of the relationship after finding out that he was bi and him reluctantly not wanting to do it at first, but was open to it since I wanted to. I brought up the idea again after assuming that he was penetrated yesterday and he was still hesitant, but is willing to, but only for me. We agreed to set boundaries and to have a clear line of communication before bringing another person into the bedroom again and going forward. He tells me that he was also jealous in the beginning when we started doing MMF but that he turned that jealousy into a fantasy. (Wanting to catch me with another guy, etc..)

he tells me that he was very consumed of the idea of another man banging me that he didn’t take my feelings into account and apologize for that. 

I honestly wish I would’ve talked to him about this sooner. I just did not want it to seem like I was shaming him for being bi, and I want him to feel comfortable in his sexuality around me. I just didn’t know that I would be jealous of the actions that took place considering that I used to watch a lot of gay porn and was open to it.","ben ve nişanlım yıllardır birlikteyiz ve nişanlıyız, ilişkimizin ilk ayında bana biseksüel olduğunu ve geçmişte erkeklerle ilişkileri olduğunu söyledi, ben de biseksüelim ve onu farklı görmenin ikiyüzlülük olacağını düşündüm, bu yüzden birlikte geçirdiğimiz aylardan sonra kabul ettim, başka bir adamla bir seks yapma fikrini ortaya attı, ilk başta isteksizdim ama sonunda deneyimledim, nişanlım diğer adama oral seks yaptı ve bunu birlikte yapmamızı istedi, o sırada ve sonrasında çok rahatsız hissettim ama ona seks yaptığımı asla söylemedim, seks onu gerçekten tahrik etti ve ayda en az xx kez farklı adamlarla yapmaya devam ettik, ilk seks yaptığında seks yaptığı tek zamandı, dün güne kadar başka bir seks yapmaya karar verdik ama bu sefer farklıydı, bitirdikten sonra bu adama oral seks yapmaya karar verdi, diğer adam nişanlımın arkasında durmaya karar verdiğinde ikisini de aynı anda emmeye başladım ve gördüğüm kadarıyla ona nüfuz ediyordu, midem bulandı, durmak ve onlara hissetmediğimi söylemek zorunda kaldım peki nişanlıma gittikten sonra bunun olup olmadığını sordum ve bunun olmadığı konusunda çok kararlıydı oda karanlıktı bu yüzden gözlerimin beni aldattığından emin değildim

bana, başka bir erkeğin beni becermesi fikrine çok kapıldığını ve duygularımı hesaba katmadığını ve bunun için özür dilediğini söyledi

dürüst olmak gerekirse, onunla bunu daha önce konuşmuş olmayı dilerdim, sadece biseksüel olduğu için onu utandırıyormuşum gibi görünmesini istemedim ve etrafımda cinselliği konusunda rahat hissetmesini istiyorum çok fazla eşcinsel pornosu izlediğimi ve buna açık olduğumu düşünürsek, gerçekleşen eylemlerden dolayı kıskanacağımı bilmiyordum"
"(edit: trans girl- being born male and transitioning to be female. i am also bisexual, not gay)

i’m a 19 year old cis guy and we have been dating for 2 years. last night she just broke down and told me. i kinda suspected it here and there throughout the years, but im really glad she finally told me. i told her that id still always love her the same and that id support her through anything. 

this morning i said good morning and used her new name and she smiled really big and gave me a hug and a kiss 

so that made me really happy too. 

i can only imagine this being a massive weight off her shoulders, i really hope that she can be happier now that she’s free to be herself. 

so, onto my question, can trans girls please tell me some things they wish they would’ve had when they first came out? specific support things, items, etc. just general tips for supporting someone :) 

thank you!

(ps. i’m kinda super glad she changed her name, because we had the same names as a particular murd3ring-duo 😬 which always bothered me in high school when kids would point out LMAO. her new name is very pretty) ","edit trans kız erkek olarak doğup kadına dönüşüyor ben de biseksüelim eşcinsel değilim

bu sabah günaydın dedim ve yeni adını kullandım ve kocaman gülümsedi ve bana sarılıp öptü

bu da beni çok mutlu etti

bunun omuzlarından büyük bir yük kalktığını hayal edebiliyorum umarım artık kendisi olmakta özgür olduğuna göre daha mutlu olabilir

"For some context, I, 24F, and Fiancé 24M are expecting our first child this November. I’m currently 32 weeks pregnant. My fiancé and I had an apartment in a major city in North Texas. Once we found out that our family was growing we decided that the city life was no longer suitable for us, and decided it was best to move closer to family. My parents offered to let us move in with them, under the agreement that we had to be moved out by February 2025. We took them up on that offer, and decided to move in with them. Once we moved in my parents immediately started working on a nursery for our son, and have spent well over $3-4k on the nursery. We never once asked them to do any of that for us, but we were also very thankful. We noticed some odd behaviors with my mother, she would say that our baby is “her baby”, and how she’s going to help us parent our unborn child. My fiancé, and I thought it was best to move out ASAP. We found a place 7 minutes away from my parent’s house. We broke the news to my parents last week, and all hell has broken loose. My mother began crying, and became belligerent. She claims that we’re taking her grandson from her, and that she’s spent so much money on the nursery, and the baby. My mother, and I won’t even speak to each other, even though we live under the same roof. My mom told me that once we move out that she will not be visiting us. 

I’m absolutely heartbroken over this situation. I’m 8 months pregnant, and I just want this to be a happy, and beautiful moment in my life. My mother has made this all about her somehow, and it’s put a strain on me mentally. 

I just don’t know what to do, or where to start in fixing this. Why is my mother so against my fiancé, and I having our own place for our family?

"I’m 20f and about to make my first big move halfway across the country. My flight leaves in 6 hours. A few hours ago my mom sat my brother and I down and straight up told us we have a half sister. Apparently my dad cheated on my mom when my two oldest siblings were young.

My parents are devout catholics and raised me in the church. They are the last people on earth I would ever expect a secret like this to come from. My dad has been in contact with her for fucking years. He’s paid her mom child support. My mom has no idea any of the details because according to her he’s never shared them and she’s never asked.

ALL of my siblings knew except for me. My eldest siblings knew because they were alive at the time everything went down and my other brother knew because he found out on accident years ago and just kept quiet about it. Didn’t even try to bring it up with everyone.

Needless to say I am fucking distraught. I was the last to know. My world was crumbling around me while my mom was explaining and my brother just sat there smiling like it was the most hilarious thing in the world.

I feel so betrayed. Not just by my dad but from my siblings. It especially hurts from them because I thought we had a close bond. I’m moving in with my brother for fucks sake. And not even a peep out of any one of them. I understand to a certain extent that it wasn’t necessarily their secret to tell but I am still livid.

My fucking dad didn’t even have the balls to tell us himself. He had my mom do it. The same fucking woman he betrayed and who was so hurt telling me her story that I cried with her.

The best part? I had my last therapy session THE SAME DAY SHE TOLD US THIS. Since I’m moving state lines my therapist can’t have me as her client so we officially ended our sessions today. I don’t think she’s closed my file yet so I might have a chance to have an emergency session with her but who fucking knows. I don’t even have a healthy outlet to deal with this anymore.

My dad is supposed to drop me off at the airport in about 3 hours and I am at a complete loss for what to do. I don’t think it’s enough time for me to process everything. I’m seeking advice on how I can make the best decision for myself. How can I actually process what the hell is going on. I still think this is a fucking dream and I’ll wake up soon. If anyone has dealt with anything similar, your insight would be greatly appreciated.

"So today I found out 5 minutes before my therapy session that my boyfriend knows my therapist and has been to his house. I've told my therapist things about my relationship that I haven't told anyone because I thought it was a safe space. To my knowledge my therapist hasn't told my bf anything but I no longer felt safe being open and honest with him so I fired him. My boyfriend and my therapist both knew they knew each other before I ever became his client. I don't trust either of them now and don't even want to go to therapy anymore. It's hard for me to find a therapist I trust I've been through 9 in the last three years each for their own reason and when I finally find one I like and feel safe with I find out he and my boyfriend have been talking and my boyfriend has been to his house.

"So, my Daughter is currently in year 1. Her teacher is absolutely brilliant. She's stunningly gorgeous and we get along really well and have good banter when we talk. I can't tell if she's been flirting with me at all but it feels like she may have been, although, I am worried thats just in my head and it's a case of girl being nice because it's kinda her job to be nice to the parents.

Anyway, I've wanted to ask for her number for a while but I've been holding back for a couple of reasons mainly being:
I don't know if she's single
She's my daughters teacher so it feels inappropriate
I'm not 100% sure she even likes me

I have a parents evening coming up where it will just be me and her in the room. Obviously the main focus is how my daughters getting on but my friend is egging me on to ask for her number at the end of this meeting so I've come to reddit for some help.

I have 2 main questions that I'd love some advice on.
1 - should I even go for this?
2 - if I am going to go through with this hoping for the best, is there any recommendations on how I could go about this to keep it as respectful as possible?

Thanks!

Edit/response:

Just want to clear up, I am single. Also, I am very aware that people in these sort of professions do have to come across nice as part of their job (which I did say in the main post as one of my concerns). No, I don't just assume anyone being 'nice' to me is flirting and no, I've never hit on or assumed a waitress or smth likes me cause they're being nice.

Anyway, thanks for all the responses, my main takeaway was to in the very least, do not pursue this while my kid is in her class. Thank you for grounding me everyone. I hadn't thought about what impact that could have on my daughter. I think I'll be letting this one go unless she makes it clear on her end. Again, thank you everyone who didn't just call me a creep! Ahah

Update:

Just wanted to do a quick update since a few people messaged me asking to update after parents evening. Sorry, it's a boring update for anyone expecting me to have asked her out.

Parents evening went well, I didn't make any moves. We just discussed how my daughter is doing in school and what I can do to help her improve. Won't go into details there though ahah.

The only thing I have to note is that, I went in without any intention of flirting ect but, when I walked in, she was actually the first to speak and she came across pretty flirty. For reference I'm wearing a normal bland T-shirt and joggers which have paint stains on them from painting my place. She started by saying 'well, you're looking pretty good today's which, idk how else to take that other than as a hint or as sarcasm. Anyway, I didn't flirt back at all other than saying that she was looking good herself. Didn't ask her out, didn't give her my number or ask for hers. Gonna take the advice of most people here and play it slow. Just gotta hope she's still interested (if she is at all) and single (which I now know she is in fact single) by the end of the school year.

Thanks again for everyone's advice! I doubt I'll ever remember to update this again but you've all been a big help.","kızım şu anda birinci sınıfta öğretmeni kesinlikle harika, inanılmaz derecede güzel ve çok iyi anlaşıyoruz ve konuştuğumuzda iyi şakalaşıyoruz benimle flört edip etmediğini anlayamıyorum ama öyleymiş gibi hissediyorum ama endişeleniyorum ki bu sadece kafamda ve bu kızın nazik olması çünkü ebeveynlerine nazik olmak onun görevi

neyse, bir süredir numarasını istemek istiyordum ama birkaç nedenden dolayı kendimi geri çekiyordum başlıcaları
bekar olup olmadığını bilmiyorum
kızımın öğretmeni olduğu için uygunsuz geliyor
benden hoşlanıp hoşlanmadığından bile emin değilim

yakında bir veli toplantısı var, odada sadece ben ve o olacağız tabii ki ana odak kızımın nasıl olduğu olacak ama arkadaşım bu toplantının sonunda numarasını istemem için beni kışkırtıyor bu yüzden yardım için reddit'e geldim

tavsiye almak istediğim temel sorularım var
bunu yapmalı mıyım
eğer bunu yapacaksam en iyisini umuyorum herhangi bir öneriniz var mı bunu mümkün olduğunca saygılı bir şekilde nasıl yapabilirim

teşekkürler

editresponse

sadece açıklığa kavuşturmak istiyorum, bekarım ayrıca bu tür mesleklerdeki insanların işlerinin bir parçası olarak iyi görünmek zorunda olduklarının çok farkındayım, bunu ana gönderide endişelerimden biri olarak söyledim hayır, bana iyi davranan herkesin flört ettiğini varsaymıyorum ve hayır, hiçbir zaman bir garsonun veya bir şeyin beni sevdiğini varsaymadım veya ona asılmadım çünkü iyi davranıyorlar

neyse, tüm yanıtlar için teşekkürler, en önemli çıkarımım, çocuğum sınıftayken en azından bunu sürdürmemekti, beni cezalandırdığınız için teşekkür ederim, kızım üzerinde bunun ne gibi bir etkisi olabileceğini düşünmemiştim, sanırım bunu bırakacağım, eğer kendisi tekrar açıkça belirtmezse. Bana sadece sapık demeyen herkese teşekkür ederim ahah

güncelleme

sadece birkaç kişi bana veli toplantısından sonra güncelleme yapmak için mesaj attığından hızlı bir güncelleme yapmak istedim, üzgünüm, benden onu dışarı davet etmemi bekleyen herkes için sıkıcı bir güncelleme

veli toplantısı iyi geçti, hiçbir hareket yapmadım, sadece nasıl olduğumu konuştuk kızım okulda ve onun gelişmesi için neler yapabileceğim konusunda ayrıntılara girmeyeceğim ama ahah

dikkat etmem gereken tek şey, flört etme gibi bir niyetim olmadan içeri girdiğim ama içeri girdiğimde aslında ilk konuşan oydu ve referans olması açısından oldukça cilveli göründü normal bir düz tişört ve eşofman altı giyiyordum ve yerimi boyadığım için üzerlerinde boya lekeleri vardı o, iyi görünüyorsun bugün, bunu bir ipucu veya alaycılıktan başka nasıl yorumlayacağımı bilmiyorum, neyse ki ben de ona flört etmedim, kendisi iyi göründüğünü söylemek dışında, onu dışarı davet etmedim, ona numaramı vermedim veya onun numarasını istemedim, buradaki çoğu insanın tavsiyesini dinleyip yavaştan alacağım, sadece hala ilgileniyorsa ve bekarsa, ki şimdi biliyorum ki okul yılının sonunda gerçekten bekar olacak

herkesin tavsiyesi için tekrar teşekkürler, bunu bir daha güncellemeyi hatırlayacağımı sanmıyorum ama hepiniz çok yardımcı oldunuz"
"Hi, my ex has limited contact with our son but he asked to meet him on Saturday in an asda car park and he made him swab his mouth for dna without talking to me or asking permission.
Does anyone know where I stand with this.

"My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years. Our entire relationship he had trust issues and would get mad when I went out without him, scared I would cheat. He made me unfollow multiple guys on instagram &amp; snapchat (which I did) and even had me stop liking any males picture on instagram all together. This angered me because I have some guy friends from college that he knows (and likes), and I personally find it rude to ignore their photos especially when I am in them. I have never given him a reason for him not to trust me, I am naturally a friendly and considerate person and he takes that as “flirting” or allowing men to flirt with me when I just don’t want to be rude (I have since fixed this behavior and would never talk to a guy in such a way, although I did feel it was rude of him to want me to change my nice personality, but I digress). 

Now the real issue. My boyfriend and I went on a trip with his family this past weekend where he got really drunk and went through my phone when I was sleeping. When he told me this I didn’t think anything because I have nothing to hide. The first thing he saw was that I liked an old college friends (male) instagram photo of him at a wedding. I did not even realize I liked the photo because so many people have been posting weddings/engagements and I was just liking all of them to be nice. I know I shouldn’t have liked it but I genuinely didn’t realize it was a guy considering there was a bride in the photo. Then, he said he went through my instagram DM’s and saw things he didn’t want to see. The things in question are me DMing famous people to come party at my college while they were doing a show there. This was over 4 years ago, when I was immature and had not even met my boyfriend yet. There was a DM of me telling a famous person I thought he was sexy and that we would make beautiful babies. I know this one is bad but I was literally 18 years old not knowing any better. I understand how this would crush him, he even said he can’t look at me the same way after reading that I said this to another guy. But I was so young, seeking male validation and would NEVER say this now let alone 2 years ago when we started dating. Can I fix this? Is he overreacting? I feel like it’s not fair to me since this was soooo long ago and we didn’t even know eachother. I need help what do I do??!!!! I love this man so much we’ve talked about getting married ourselves and I would hate to throw it all away because of my past self. Is our relationship over for good or is it worth fighting for? ","erkek arkadaşım ve ben neredeyse yıllardır çıkıyoruz, ilişkimiz boyunca güven sorunları vardı ve onsuz dışarı çıktığımda sinirleniyordu, aldatacağımdan korkuyordu, beni instagram ve snapchat'te birden fazla erkeği takipten çıkardı, ben de öyle yaptım ve hatta instagram'da hiçbir erkek resmini beğenmememi sağladı, bu beni kızdırdı çünkü üniversiteden tanıdığı ve sevdiği birkaç erkek arkadaşım var ve ben şahsen özellikle de ben olduğumda fotoğraflarını görmezden gelmeyi kaba buluyorum, ona bana güvenmemesi için hiçbir sebep vermedim, doğal olarak arkadaş canlısı ve düşünceli bir insanım ve o bunu flört etmek veya erkeklerin benimle flört etmesine izin vermek olarak algılıyor, ben sadece kaba olmak istemediğimde bu davranışımı düzelttim ve asla bir erkekle böyle konuşmam, yine de iyi kişiliğimi değiştirmemi istemesinin kaba olduğunu hissettim ama konudan uzaklaşıyorum

şimdi gerçek sorun, erkek arkadaşım ve ben geçen hafta sonu ailesiyle bir geziye çıktık, çok sarhoş oldu ve ben uyurken telefonumu karıştırdı, bana bunu söylediğinde hiçbir şey düşünmedim çünkü saklayacak hiçbir şeyim yoktu, gördüğü ilk şey bendim Üniversiteden eski bir arkadaşımın erkek instagram fotoğrafını beğendim, bir düğünde çekilmiş bir fotoğrafını beğendim. Fotoğrafı beğendiğimi bile fark etmemiştim çünkü birçok kişi düğün, nişan fotoğrafları paylaşıyordu ve ben sadece hepsini hoş oldukları için beğeniyordum. Beğenmemem gerektiğini biliyordum ama fotoğrafta bir gelin olduğunu düşünürsek bunun bir erkek olduğunu gerçekten fark etmemiştim. Sonra instagram DM'lerime baktığını ve görmek istemediği şeyler gördüğünü söyledi. Söz konusu şeyler, üniversitemde bir gösteri yaparken ünlü insanlara DM atıyor muyum? Bu yıllar önce, olgunlaşmamış olduğum ve erkek arkadaşımla tanışmadığım zamandı. Ünlü birine onu seksi bulduğumu ve güzel bebekler yapacağımızı söylediğim bir DM atmıştım. Bunun kötü olduğunu biliyorum ama daha iyisini bilmiyordum ve bunun onu nasıl yıkacağını anlıyorum. Bunu başka bir erkeğe söylediğimi okuduktan sonra bana aynı şekilde bakamayacağını bile söyledi. Ama çok gençtim ve erkeklerin onayını arıyordum ve bunu şimdi bile asla söylemezdim. Yıllar önce çıkmaya başladığımızda bunu düzeltebilir miyim? Aşırı tepki mi veriyor? Bana karşı adil olmadığını düşünüyorum. bu çok uzun zaman önceydi ve birbirimizi tanımıyorduk bile yardıma ihtiyacım var ne yapmalıyım bu adamı çok seviyorum evlenmekten kendimiz de bahsettik ve geçmiş benliğim yüzünden her şeyi çöpe atmaktan nefret ediyorum ilişkimiz sonsuza dek bitti mi yoksa uğruna savaşmaya değer mi"
"8-year-old sister had asked me whether she was born was because of sex. I honestly answered “yes” because I knew she would find out sooner or later. Also, I don’t have the heart to lie to her. Although I did not delve into the lovemaking details usually reserved for Sex Ed (penis goes into vagina, sperm fertilizes egg, etc), the way she phrased her question was one where you cannot fool her into thinking she was transported by UPS storks.  
  
I was slightly relieved she didn’t press on for what I was taught in Sex Ed, but she has absorbed how pregnancy works, one by a tell-tale sign of missing a period (which she has not completely learned yet). She had gained this knowledge by subscribing to a YouTuber who talked about her pregnancy experience (I’m guessing in vlogs and AMA form).  
  
Having her own phone, she started to do something I only remembered doing first at 15 on my desktop: googling XXX on purpose. I thought she would be searching for the movie XXX: Xander Cage or the late rapper XXXTentacion (autofill gives his profile), she actually typed in XXX as in intent to enter a pornsite. She had clicked on images and had screenfuls of naked sex, with cum dripping out in some, faces of orgasm and pain in others and period sex in one image. Her curiosity ended up in me explaining to her that the cum is “discharge” (which she didn’t probe further into) and that sex is painful, comparing it to the most painful vaccination she remembered. She listened in awe, and I was asked if I had done it before with my SO. No, sis. (context: SO didn’t consent, wanted to keep the V-card until marriage. But watched porn regularly and had friends who slept around)  
  
Since I had gone this far down the rabbit hole, I warned her that sex is by mutual consent ONLY, and she cannot do it until she is grown up (I regret not telling her both partners must be 18), and she must refuse any sexual encounters or I will personally hunt the predator down. I repeatedly emphasized that underage and/or non-consensual sex will get her and/or her partner thrown in jail.  
  
The previous paragraph, yes, were big words for an 8-year-old, so I analogized it to a game of NERF (since she is a NERF enthusiast, and I have a NERF gun at home) - “you must get your friend’s permission, and both you and them must be OK with playing NERF together. If your friend says no, and you shoot them anyway, you’re a bully and will get into trouble. Because your friend already said no.”  
  
Now, she remembers having the talk as the ""NERF talk"". I’m quite shaken by this. I never had “the talk” at home growing up, and I only had Sex Ed, biology, porn, and my friends’ sexual experiences to formulate this. I am concerned with how much exposure she has when she is not with me or my folks. Should I let my dad know about the talk? Is it rude for me to tap her phone (personal property) and tighten Internet control? How do I approach this? Any advice is appreciated.  
  
Also, if this is more appropriate for an asking parent forum do let me know. Thank you.","yaşındaki kız kardeşim bana seks yüzünden mi doğduğunu sormuştu, dürüstçe evet dedim çünkü er ya da geç öğreneceğini biliyordum ayrıca ona yalan söyleyecek yüreğim yok, her ne kadar seks eğitimi için ayrılmış sevişme detaylarına girmesem de penis vajinaya girer sperm yumurtayı döller vs. sorusunu sorma şekli, onu ups leylekleriyle taşındığını düşünmeye kandıramayacağınız türdendi 

seks eğitiminde bana öğretilenler için baskı yapmadığı için biraz rahatladım ama hamileliğin nasıl işlediğini henüz tam olarak öğrenmediği bir adet gecikmesinin habercisi olan bir belirtiyle özümsedi bunu, hamilelik deneyiminden bahseden bir youtuber'a abone olarak edinmişti sanırım vlog'larda ve ama formunda 

kendi telefonuna sahip olarak ilk başta masaüstümde xxx'i bilerek Google'da ararken hatırladığım bir şeyi yapmaya başladı, xxx xander cage filmini veya merhum rapçi xxxtentacion'ı arayacağını düşündüm otomatik doldurma profilini veriyor aslında xxx yazmış bir porno sitesine girme niyetindeydi, resimlere tıklamıştı ve bazı yüzlerinden orgazm ve acı akan çıplak seks görüntüleri ve bir resimde adet dönemi seks görüntüleri izlemişti, merakı sonunda ona spermin bir akıntı olduğunu ve daha fazla araştırmadığını ve seksin acı verici olduğunu, hatırladığı en acı verici aşıyla karşılaştırdığını anlattım, hayranlıkla dinledi ve daha önce kız kardeşimle birlikte olup olmadığım soruldu, bu yüzden rızam yoktu, evlenene kadar vcard'ı saklamak istedim ama düzenli olarak porno izledim ve etrafta yatan arkadaşlarım vardı


Buraya kadar tavşan deliğinden aşağı indiğimden beri ona seksin yalnızca karşılıklı rızayla yapılabileceğini ve büyüyene kadar yapamayacağını söyledim, ona söylemediğim için pişmanım, her iki partner de öyle olmalı ve herhangi bir cinsel karşılaşmayı reddetmeli, aksi takdirde avcıyı bizzat avlayacağım, reşit olmayan ve/veya rıza dışı seksin kendisini ve/veya partnerini hapse attıracağını defalarca vurguladım

Önceki paragrafta evet, bir yaşındaki bir çocuk için büyük kelimelerdi, bu yüzden onu bir nerf oyununa benzettim çünkü o bir nerf tutkunu ve ben evde bir nerf silahı bulundurmalısın, arkadaşlarından izin almalısın ve ikiniz de birlikte nerf oynamaktan memnun olmalısınız eğer arkadaşın hayır derse ve sen yine de vurursan zorba olursun ve arkadaşın zaten hayır dediği için başın derde girer


şimdi nerf konuşması olarak konuştuğunu hatırlıyor, bundan oldukça sarsıldım, çocukluğumda evde hiç konuşmadım ve sadece cinsel eğitim biyoloji pornosu ve arkadaşlarımın cinsel deneyimleri vardı, bunu formüle etmek için benimle veya ailemle olmadığında ne kadar maruz kaldığı konusunda endişeliyim, babama konuşmadan bahsetmeli miyim, onun telefonunu kişisel eşyalarını dinlemek ve internet kontrolünü sıkılaştırmak kaba mı? buna nasıl yaklaşmalıyım? herhangi bir tavsiyeniz varsa sevinirim


ayrıca bunun bir ebeveyn forumunda soru sormak için daha uygun olup olmadığını bana bildirin, teşekkür ederim"
"Hello, I am posting to ask about this situation mentioned in the title of the post. I am a 24 yo woman with a really messed up family. One of the things that's so messed up in my family is a lack of innocence protecting in regards to the children in it. My Uncle is trying to kick off a new tattooing career, he is not certified, he has never been properly trained, which whatever, not my problem, but then I was told last night that he has began offering this ""talent"" to his children, one being literally 9 yos. The other child was in a family of addicts and was abandoned on my Uncle, there are no legal documents about them being her guardian, but she is also getting tattoos from my Uncle.

The reason I'm asking is because Google is pretty 50/50 on this being okay, so I can't tell if it is. I also do not like my Uncle, like at all, so I know I'm kinda predisposed to wanting to get him in trouble so I also can't tell if I'm just being malicious. There are many reasons why I *want* to say something, report him or such, because he could hurt them, cause infection, permanently mark his children with shit that only a 10 yo would want, I don't like my Uncle so why not, etc. Should I? Would it be pointless and just spiteful? I don't know, I guess I should start with, is it morally acceptable to say nothing? I just don't know..

Edit: To qualm some fears, I will let you guys know I am on hold for CPS. I hadn't really even thought of some of these consequences, thank you for helping me to appropriately adjust my understanding of the severity of this as a safety hazard. (Not so much a wake up call on him being a bad parent, I knew that.)

Edit 2: I just got off the phone with CPS. They will be checking into the matter.

Some have mentioned a good point, I don't know this is true. I have had clashes with many family members over things they've done as parents, and my Uncle is not safe from that criticism, because of that, we do not talk. We do not offiliate, and as it typically goes, the kids kinda hate me too as they are so young, so I cannot ask. I am blocked by the kids, have been a long time and my Uncle and ""Aunt"" are blocked by me. I did make sure to say this in the report, this very well could've been two kids lying and bragging together (I originally heard this from my sister (21) who was told by my youngest sister (13) who is still good friends with my cousin (the 9 yo of this story), who told her).  I will let you know tomorrow if CPS decides to start an investigation or not.

Edit 3: I called my sister, the elder one who told me about this and asked if she had seen them because she goes over there, whereas I do not. They are real. She has seen them herself.

Edit 4: CPS has deemed that an investigation is not warranted.. I don't know. As much as I feel like all of the comments have made good points and the morality of this is is so obviously abhorrent, I don't know I could do anything else.. I cannot take the kids in, even if they'd want me to, and the only tool I could think of didn't work so.. idk.","merhaba, gönderinin başlığında belirtilen durum hakkında soru sormak için yazıyorum ben gerçekten sorunlu bir aileye sahip bir yo kadınıyım ailemde çok sorunlu olan şeylerden biri de çocukları koruma konusunda masumiyet eksikliği amcam yeni bir dövme kariyerine başlamaya çalışıyor sertifikalı değil hiç düzgün bir eğitim almadı bu benim sorunum değil ama sonra dün gece bana bu yeteneğini çocuklarına sunmaya başladığını söylediler biri tam anlamıyla yos diğer çocuk bağımlı bir ailedeymiş ve amcam tarafından terk edilmiş onların velisi olduklarına dair yasal bir belge yok ama o da amcamdan dövme yaptırıyor

sorma sebebim google'ın bunun uygun olduğuna dair oldukça olumlu olması bu yüzden öyle olup olmadığını söyleyemem ayrıca amcamı hiç sevmiyorum bu yüzden onu başını belaya sokmak istemeye yatkın olduğumu biliyorum bu yüzden sadece kötü niyetli olup olmadığımı da söyleyemem bir şey söylemek istememin birçok nedeni var onu şikayet edin veya benzeri şeyler çünkü onlara zarar verebilir enfeksiyona neden olabilir çocuklarını sadece bir yo'nun isteyeceği şeylerle kalıcı olarak işaretleyebilir sevmediğim amcam neden olmasın vs. yapmalı mıyım anlamsız ve sadece kin dolu olur mu bilmiyorum sanırım ahlaki olarak hiçbir şey söylememek kabul edilebilir mi diye başlamalıyım sadece bilmiyorum

düzenleme endişeleri bazı korkular var size bildireceğim cps için beklemedeyim bu sonuçlardan bazılarını gerçekten düşünmemiştim bu durumun ciddiyetini bir güvenlik tehlikesi olarak uygun şekilde ayarlamama yardımcı olduğunuz için teşekkür ederim kötü bir ebeveyn olduğu konusunda bir uyarı değil biliyordum

düzenleme cps ile yeni telefonda görüştüm konuyu araştıracaklar

bazıları iyi bir noktadan bahsetmişler bilmiyorum bu doğru birçok aile üyesiyle ebeveyn olarak yaptıkları şeyler yüzünden anlaşmazlık yaşadım ve amcam bu eleştirilerden güvende değil bu yüzden konuşmuyoruz bağlı değiliz ve genelde olduğu gibi çocuklar da benden nefret ediyor çünkü çok küçükler bu yüzden soramıyorum çocuklar tarafından engellendim uzun zamandır ve amcam ve teyzem benim tarafımdan engellendi bunu raporda söylediğimden emin oldum bu çok iyi iki çocuğun yalan söyleyip övünmesi olabilirdi başlangıçta bunu kız kardeşimden duydum, bu hikayeyi hala kuzenimle iyi arkadaş olan en küçük kız kardeşim ona yarın sana haber vereceğim demiş, eğer CPS bir soruşturma başlatmaya karar verirse veya vermezse

düzenle bu konudan bana bahseden büyük kız kardeşimi aradım ve onları görüp görmediğini sordum çünkü oraya gitti, ben gerçek olmadıklarını biliyorum ama kendisi gördü

düzenle CPS bir soruşturmanın haklı olmadığına karar verdi, tüm yorumların iyi noktalara değindiğini hissediyorum ve bunun ahlaki boyutu o kadar açıkça iğrenç ki başka bir şey yapabileceğimi bilmiyorum, çocukları içeri alamam, isteseler bile ve aklıma gelen tek araç işe yaramadı, bu yüzden bilmiyorum"

I 22 F find my best friend who's also 22 F very attractive. She makes comments to me all of the time telling me how hot l am, how she likes women and has been with them before. She's even showed me her boobs before. The thing with women it's confusing to know what they actually want. I asked her if she finds me attractive and she said ""in a friendly way sorry if I made you uncomfortable"" I don't know if she actually means that or if I just put her on the spot and she didn't know what to say. What should I do?",en iyi arkadaşımı bulursam o da çok çekicidir bana sürekli yorumlar yapar ne kadar ateşli olduğumu söyler kadınlardan hoşlandığını ve daha önce de onlarla birlikte olduğunu söyler bana daha önce göğüslerini bile göstermişti kadınlar konusunda ne istediklerini bilmek kafa karıştırıcıdır ona beni çekici bulup bulmadığını sordum ve arkadaşça bir şekilde özür dilerim eğer seni rahatsız ettiysem bunu gerçekten kastettiğini bilmiyorum yoksa onu zor durumda mı bıraktım ve ne diyeceğini bilmiyor ne yapmalıyım
My boyfriend (21 M) and I(22F) have been together for 6 months. At this point we are basically living together. I recently told him I felt it was too early to be basically living together and now it seems like he’s icing me out. He stays at my apartment every single night and when I want to be alone or just with my friends I feel guilty because he tells me he misses me. We’ve also been arguing a couple times a week and I just feel like it’s too early for all of that. I communicated that to him and he’s taking it like I said I never wanted to see him again. I love him and don’t like how he’s changed his behavior towards me now. What do I do? ,erkek arkadaşım ve ben aylardır birlikteyiz bu noktada temelde birlikte yaşıyoruz yakın zamanda ona temelde birlikte yaşamak için çok erken olduğunu hissettiğimi söyledim ve şimdi beni dışlıyor gibi görünüyor her gece dairemde kalıyor ve yalnız kalmak istediğimde veya sadece arkadaşlarımla olmak istediğimde suçlu hissediyorum çünkü beni özlediğini söylüyor ayrıca haftada birkaç kez tartışıyoruz ve bunun için çok erken olduğunu düşünüyorum bunu ona ilettim ve bunu söylediğim gibi algıladı onu bir daha asla görmek istemedim onu ​​seviyorum ve bana karşı davranışlarını değiştirmesinden hoşlanmıyorum şimdi ne yapmalıyım
"(I tried to post through RA but it didn't work)

I (28F) has been dating my boyfriend (28M) for almost 2 years. We're traveling for the first time internationality. Long story but you kinda need to know:

I fumbled and I fully acknowledge I am 1000000000% at fault. I'm embarrassed. We were checking in for our flight and I forgot my passport. I made a rash last minute decision to switch my fanny pack and I left my passport behind. I was so ashamed and apologetic. We live outside of the main city so it'll take me an hour to get back (making two hour roundtrip if I'm lucky with no traffic). So I wouldn't recover my passport in time. The moment I shared that I forgot, my boyfriend blew up :(. He was calling me stupid and forgetful. And tbh, I wasn't disagreeing. I was like: I know.. I know..
I was so anxious and embarrassed with how he was scolding me in front of the flight attendant. She was giving me this look that I knew but I stayed calm. The flight attendant was quick on helping me. She said I can catch tomorrow's flight and pay a $300 difference. I thought that was super reasonable. But my boyfriend was like: what about me?? And I said he can go on ahead and I'll catch up a day later. Then he was ranting about how we are supposed to travel together so then I suggested I'll also pay to change his flight with me. Then he complained that it's a waste of money and we could've spent $600 on the trip if I wasn't so dumb. (money is not a problem, dw). I was holding it together because there was a lot of people in line behind us and I wasn't trying to cause a scene. I probably apologized a hundred times and the flight attendant was even going out of her way to look for other flights from other places that may fly out same day. For the whole 20-30 minutes, my bf was being so hard on me and I know I derailed our plans but I'm trying my best to fix it. He kept on sighing so hard and grunting, I was so stressed out. Suddenly, the flight attendant asked: can anyone bring your passport? I'll bring you to the priority line through tsa to help you. I'm like omg! So I called my best friend and begged her to go to my place to bring my passport and she came through (I love her soooo much). So all good? NO
I told my bf he can check in first and go inside but he insisted in staying with me. As we proceeded to wait for my bestie to come, he kept scolding me. I know I fucked up. He kept saying: Oh your best friend better make it on time. How could you forget? If we miss this flight, idk if I care to catch the next one. You're so stupid. Etc.

Honestly, I lost some of my lifespan waiting and praying my friend would come on time. Thankfully she did and with the help of the same flight attendant, we made it though with 7 minutes before boarding. The moment I sat down on the flight and finally collected myself, I cried. But then my bf was being so affectionate. He was hugging me and patting my head and saying: we’re ok. Don't worry, we made it.

I straight up told him I didn't appreciate the way he treated me earlier and he's like: can't coddle dumb behaviors. Which I'm like ???. He was really good at consoling and promised he'll buy dinner the moment we land. I thought I could forgive him and I really want to enjoy our trip. We landed and he's all happy and back to his loving self but the situation at the airport is bothering me. Any advice? Like I know I messed up pretty badly so maybe I should just let it go bc that was on me. I just wished he was nicer. How can I bring it up again without ruining the vibe or should I wait till we finish traveling? Or just suck it up bc I was the one who cause it anyway?","ra üzerinden gönderi paylaşmaya çalıştım ama işe yaramadı

erkek arkadaşımla neredeyse yıllardır çıkıyorum ilk kez seyahat ediyordum uluslararası uzun hikaye ama biraz bilmen gerek

beceremedim ve tamamen hatanın ben olduğumu kabul ediyorum utanıyorum uçuşumuz için check-in yapıyorduk ve pasaportumu unuttum son dakika aceleyle bel çantamı değiştirme kararı aldım ve pasaportumu orada bıraktım çok utandım ve özür diledim ana şehrin dışında yaşıyoruz bu yüzden geri dönmem bir saatimi alacak şanslıysam iki saatlik gidiş dönüş olacak trafik olmadığı için pasaportumu zamanında kurtaramazdım erkek arkadaşımın patladığını paylaştığım anda bana aptal ve unutkan diyordu ve açıkçası ben de katılmıyordum biliyordum biliyordum
uçuş görevlisinin önünde beni nasıl azarladığı konusunda çok endişeli ve utanmıştım bana bildiğim bir bakış atıyordu ama sakin kaldım uçuş görevlisi bana hemen yardım etti yarınki uçuşa yetişebileceğimi ve farkı ödeyebileceğimi söyledi bunun çok makul olduğunu düşündüm ama benim erkek arkadaşım bana ne olacak dedi ve ben ona devam edebileceğini ve bir gün sonra görüşebileceğimizi söyledim sonra birlikte seyahat etmemiz gerektiğinden yakınmaya başladı sonra ben de uçuşunu benimle değiştirmek için para ödeyeceğimi önerdim sonra bunun para israfı olduğunu ve eğer bu kadar aptal olmasaydım seyahate para harcayabileceğimizi söyledi para sorun değil dw kendimi tutuyordum çünkü arkamızda sırada çok insan vardı ve bir olay çıkarmaya çalışmıyordum muhtemelen yüzlerce kez özür diledim ve uçuş görevlisi aynı gün kalkabilecek başka yerlerden başka uçuşlar aramak için elinden geleni yapıyordu tüm dakikalar boyunca erkek arkadaşım bana karşı çok sertti ve planlarımızı rayından çıkardığımı biliyorum ama düzeltmek için elimden geleni yapıyorum sürekli iç çekip homurdanıyordu çok stresliydim aniden uçuş görevlisi pasaportunuzu getirebilir misiniz diye sordu seni TSA üzerinden öncelikli hatta götüreceğim sana yardım etmek için dedim aman Tanrım dedim sonra en yakın arkadaşımı aradım ve pasaportumu getirmesi için evime gelmesi için yalvardım ve geldi onu çok seviyorum her şey yolunda hayır
erkek arkadaşıma önce check-in yapıp içeri girebileceğini söyledim ama en yakın arkadaşımın gelmesini beklerken benimle kalmakta ısrar etti, beni azarlamaya devam etti, berbat ettiğimi biliyorum, sürekli en iyi arkadaşın zamanında gelse iyi olur, bu uçağı kaçırırsak nasıl unutabilirsin, bir sonrakini yakalamak isteyip istemediğimi bilmiyorum, çok aptalsın vb. diyordu

dürüst olmak gerekirse ömrümün bir kısmını arkadaşımın zamanında gelmesini bekleyerek ve dua ederek harcadım, şükürler olsun ki geldi ve aynı uçuş görevlisinin yardımıyla uçağa binmemize dakikalar kala başardık, uçağa oturduğum ve sonunda kendimi toparladığım an ağladım ama sonra erkek arkadaşım çok şefkatliydi, bana sarılıyor ve başımı okşuyordu ve iyiyiz, endişelenme, başardık diyordu

ona daha önce bana davrandığı şekilde davranmasını takdir etmediğimi ve aptalca davranışları şımartamayacağını söyledim, ki benim gibi, teselli etmekte gerçekten iyiydi ve indiğimiz anda bize akşam yemeği ısmarlayacağına söz verdi, onu affedebileceğimi düşündüm ve yolculuğumuzun tadını çıkarmak istiyorum, indik ve o çok mutlu ve sevgi dolu haline geri döndü ama havaalanındaki durum beni rahatsız ediyor, biliyorum çok kötü bir hata yaptım bu yüzden belki de bunu görmezden gelmeliyim çünkü bu benim hatamdı sadece keşke daha nazik olsaydı havayı bozmadan bunu nasıl tekrar gündeme getirebilirim yoksa seyahatimiz bitene kadar mı beklemeliyim yoksa sadece katlanmalı mıyım çünkü zaten buna ben sebep oldum"
"Hi for context im 17 and I live with my mom and younger sister. My parents are divorced and my deadbeat dad lives in LA. me and my sister share a room and it was never an issue except for the clutter. my mom decided on a whim that she will be charging me $300 a month to live with her on top of me paying car payments and therapy bills and it has been stressing me out a ton I’ve been crying every day. I have a minimum wage job and my paychecks are basically only $300. Since I’m a minor, my bank account is connected to my moms so she can take money out as she pleases. This seems to be a pattern where she will take money out of my account when she is upset with me. It should be mentioned that she already told me that she will be kicking me out when i’m 18 but said that as long as I live with her she is going to “get something out of it.” I have been considering trying to move into my Grandma’s spare room and paying her rent but I am nervous about asking somebody if I can just move in with them. Advice needed. 

edit: ive been in communication with my aunt who lives with my grandma (they are on my dads side) but she said that they are also having struggles and arent sure how to help me so im not sure if this is a viable option anymore. my moms family doesnt like me because they think im crazy, ive been told it to my face plus they live hours away from me so they arent an option. for those saying to call cps, ive had cps at my house before and yeah my moms been verbally and physically abusive since i was little. I draw the line at her taking my money that i was saving up to move out; i just really need to find somewhere else to stay thats not the foster care system because thats messy ","merhaba bağlam için ben ve annem ve küçük kız kardeşimle yaşıyorum annem ve babam boşanmış ve sorumsuz babam Los Angeles'ta yaşıyor kız kardeşim ve ben bir odayı paylaşıyoruz ve dağınıklık dışında hiç sorun olmadı annem bir hevesle araba taksitlerini ve terapi faturalarını ödememe ek olarak onunla yaşamak için benden bir ay ücret almaya karar verdi ve bu beni çok strese sokuyor her gün ağlıyorum asgari ücretli bir işte çalışıyorum ve maaş çeklerim temelde sadece küçük yaştan beri geliyor banka hesabım annemin hesabına bağlı böylece istediği gibi para çekebiliyor bu bana kızdığında hesabımdan para çekmesi gibi bir düzen gibi görünüyor bana beni evden atacağını söylemişti ama onunla yaşadığım sürece bundan bir şeyler kazanacağını söylemişti büyükannemin yedek odasına taşınmayı ve kirasını ödemeyi düşünüyorum ama birine onlarla yaşamaya gidebilir miyim diye sormaktan çekiniyorum tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var

And when I gave her the standard haha my parents are white but I get that a lot she just laughed and said ""your mixed with something honey, you look like you could be my cousin""

"Weird title, I know. Hear me out. 

My husband (44m) and I (45f) are very, very different. I am very feely and emotional. I often have difficulty explaining my feelings and tend to have an implicit understanding of the world. 

My husband is not yet diagnosed, but is probably somewhere on the spectrum. He needs very clear communication to understand and since I’m not always good at using my big girl voice, I am often a mystery to him. 

So, today we went to a water park and ate a lot of crap. Tacos, pizza and funnel cake. When we got home, I said I felt really gross from the greasy, fatty food and wanted to eat a veggie heavy dinner to feel cleaner. 

I have said this before and he never seems to understand. He asked me to explain to him what I mean again because he can’t fathom “feeling” different foods and he thinks it’s all in my head. He says when he eats, food goes in and never feels any different. That sounds insane to me. 

I don’t really understand what he doesn’t  understand. If I eat something that tastes yummy but feels greasy and makes my stomach squirm, I eat some celery or something very fibrous and it helps me feel better. 

Do other people understand this? How would you go about explaining this?","garip başlık biliyorum beni dinle

"I (26F) got married recently, and my sister (22F) was my MOH. She has always been very similar to my mom in terms of personality (narcissist) and thinks she is very funny all of the time. She opened her speech by saying “the bride and groom have confided in me, that they are expecting!…….. everyone to have a good time tonight!!!” 

We are NOT pregnant! Obviously my fiancé and I hated that and shook our heads and gave thumbs down, as did the rest of our wedding party who are our close friends and know our opinions on pregnancy for us (we want to adopt eventually). But she just laughed and kept going with her speech, which did not really get much better after that tbh. We were kind of upset, but just brushed it off for now and enjoyed our wedding. 

We had a video booth guest book, and when it was her turn, my sister doubled down saying how excited she was to be an aunt and how she would be the best aunt and I better be ready to let her babysit my kid.

It was very annoying, but the worst part is that guests think I am actually pregnant. We started getting more gifts with notes like “here is X to help when the little baby comes!” Or “you will be glad to have X with a newborn around!” I never want to be pregnant, my fiancé gets this,  and this whole situation is freaking me out that guests think I was pregnant at my wedding and it’s all because of her dumb joke. 

Should I tell her the speech sucked and that I’m upset with her? Or just try to let it go and tell guests there is no baby when I write the thank you notes? My sister will probably not be receptive to my criticism, but it might make me feel better to get it off my chest? Ugh.","i f yakın zamanda evlendim ve kız kardeşim f benim moh'umdu, kişilik açısından her zaman anneme çok benziyordu, narsisistti ve her zaman çok komik olduğunu düşünüyordu, konuşmasına gelin ve damadın bana herkesin bu gece iyi vakit geçirmesini beklediklerini söylediğini söyleyerek başladı

Elbette hamile değiliz, nişanlım ve ben bundan nefret ettik ve başımızı salladık ve baş parmaklarımızı aşağı salladık, düğün partimizin geri kalanı da aynısını yaptı, yakın arkadaşlarımız ve hamilelik hakkındaki görüşlerimizi biliyorlar, bizim için sonunda evlat edinmek istiyoruz ama o sadece güldü ve konuşmasına devam etti, dürüst olmak gerekirse bundan sonra pek düzelmedi, biraz üzüldük ama şimdilik umursamadık ve düğünümüzün tadını çıkardık

Bir video kabini misafir defterimiz vardı ve sıra ona geldiğinde kız kardeşim teyze olmaktan ne kadar heyecan duyduğunu ve en iyi teyze olacağını ve çocuğuma bakmasına izin vermeye hazır olmam gerektiğini söyledi

Çok can sıkıcıydı ama en kötü yanı, misafirlerin gerçekten hamile olduğumu düşünmesi, yardım için x gibi notlarla daha fazla hediye almaya başladık küçük bebek geldiğinde veya yeni doğmuş bir bebekle x'e sahip olmaktan mutlu olacağın zaman asla hamile kalmak istemiyorum nişanlım bunu yaşıyor ve bu durum beni korkutuyor, düğünümde misafirler hamile olduğumu düşünüyor ve hepsi onun aptalca şakası yüzünden

ona konuşmanın berbat olduğunu ve ona kızdığımı mı söylemeliyim yoksa sadece boş verip misafirlere teşekkür notlarını yazdığımda bebek olmadığını mı söylemeliyim kız kardeşim muhtemelen eleştirilerime açık olmayacak ama içimden atmak beni daha iyi hissettirebilir ugh"
"Do I break up with him ?

last year, when it started to get more intimate with my first and only boyfriend, I (19F) asked him (22M) multiple times if he could get tested before we did anything, and he refused every single time, even though I did get tested and was cleared. But one thing lead to another, I caved and we ended up having intercourse (my first time). 

Upon questioning why he refused to get tested, he said that he didn’t believe he had anything.

A few weeks later I started feeling debilitating pain in my stomach. This is now a little over a year ago, and it led to me having an emergency surgery last month. 
After the surgery, the doctor told me that I had an STI which led to my right ovary and everything around it being completely infected. 
He also said that chances are that my ovaries don’t function regularly anymore, and also that my partner should get tested, the doctor was sure it came from him. So he gets tested and it turns out positive. 

And it was the first time I had ever had intercourse with someone in my life, which is why I asked for him to get tested in the first place. Looking back it seems like a huge red flag, but at the end it was still my decision. 

I still cannot get over it tbh, I have to see these ugly stitches on my stomach everyday now, and also live with the pain of those, as well as the immobility (which I know will get better with time). And even though I don’t want kids, I would still like to be as healthy as I was. I felt more powerful when it was a choice not to have kids. Knowing that it might not be just a personal choice anymore hurts me a lot actually. I had a perfectly healthy and functioning body and now I haven’t had my period for almost 2 months.

And no he did not cheat, or kept it a secret from me. He is just very stupid and his ego got in his way, like most men.

Besides this thing, he is the perfect man, he goes above and beyond every single day for me.
He does seem to really regret it, I’ve caught him crying on the phone to his friends about how much he fucked up and he feels bad that he hurt me, and how he knows its not forgivable.

My question is; do I break up with him? Or can we work it out? And if so, how do we work it out?
 Does anyone have experience with this? Please share.

TL;DR :

My boyfriend unknowingly gave me an STI, even though I asked for him to get tested. I suffer the consequences of an infection now.
My respect for him is out the window. But I do still love him.
Do I break up ? Or can we work it out ?","ondan ayrılmalı mıyım

geçen yıl ilk ve tek erkek arkadaşımla daha yakınlaşmaya başladığımızda ona bir şey yapmadan önce test yaptırıp yaptıramayacağını defalarca sordum ve her seferinde reddetti, test yaptırıp temiz çıkmama rağmen ama bir şey diğerine yol açtı, pes ettim ve ilk kez ilişkiye girdik

neden test yaptırmayı reddettiğini sorduğumda hiçbir şeye sahip olduğuna inanmadığını söyledi

birkaç hafta sonra midemde dayanılmaz bir ağrı hissetmeye başladım, bu şimdi bir yıl kadar önce oldu ve geçen ay acil bir ameliyat geçirmeme neden oldu
ameliyattan sonra doktor bana bir sti olduğumu söyledi, bu da sağ yumurtalığımın ve etrafındaki her şeyin tamamen enfekte olmasına yol açtı
ayrıca yumurtalıklarımın artık düzenli çalışmadığını ve ayrıca partnerimin test yaptırması gerektiğini söyledi, doktor bunun ondan geldiğinden emindi, bu yüzden test yaptırdı ve pozitif çıktı

ve hayatımda biriyle ilk kez ilişkiye girmiştim, bu yüzden ilk etapta test yaptırmasını istedim Geriye dönüp baktığımda büyük bir kırmızı bayrak gibi görünüyor ama sonunda bu hala benim kararımdı

Açıkçası hala bunun üstesinden gelemiyorum her gün karnımda bu çirkin dikişleri görmek ve ayrıca zamanla düzeleceğini bildiğim hareketsizliğin yanı sıra bunların acısıyla yaşamak zorundayım ve çocuk istemesem de eskisi kadar sağlıklı olmak istiyorum çocuk sahibi olmama kararı aldığımda kendimi daha güçlü hissettim artık bunun sadece kişisel bir karar olmayabileceğini bilmek beni çok üzüyor aslında mükemmel derecede sağlıklı ve işleyen bir vücudum vardı ve şimdi neredeyse aylardır adet görmüyorum

Ve hayır beni aldatmadı ya da benden saklamadı sadece çok aptal ve egosu çoğu erkek gibi onun önüne geçti

Bunun dışında o mükemmel bir adam benim için her gün elinden gelenin fazlasını yapıyor
Gerçekten pişman gibi görünüyor arkadaşlarıyla telefonda ağlarken yakaladım ne kadar çok hata yaptığını ve beni incittiği için kötü hissettiğini ve bunun affedilemez olduğunu bildiğini söylüyor

Benim sorum onunla ayrılmalı mıyım yoksa anlaşabilir miyiz ve eğer öyleyse bunu nasıl çözeceğiz
bu konuda deneyimi olan var mı lütfen paylaşın

tldr

erkek arkadaşım bilmeden bana bir STI verdi, test yaptırmasını istememe rağmen şimdi bir enfeksiyonun sonuçlarına katlanıyorum
ona olan saygım pencereden uçtu ama onu hala seviyorum
ayrılmalı mıyım yoksa çözebilir miyiz"
"I’m at breaking point. I’ve been with my ( f29) bf(m34) Toby for 5 years in total. For the past year we had been trying for a baby with no luck. Eventually we went for testing. Well I did and I’m fine so Toby went and he is infertile. He was devastated. I was more optimistic saying I was very open to adoption. After a few weeks he came to me with a “suggestion”. Toby has an identical twin brother Tom. And yes he wanted to get his brother to be the bio father to our baby. 

The thing is his brother is a toxic ahole. He never can get past three dates with a woman because he is an ahole. I’ve accepted that he will always be in our lives as he and Toby are very close. When I met Toby Tom was working on the other side of the country and I didn’t even meet him for two years in person. But Toby is different when with Tom. He’s kinda toxic too. 
There was a point after Tom moved back that he started to make jokes about me but they were mean! And Toby laughed and joined in. I’m normally quiet and non confrontational but I blew up on them and they stopped but things have not been good between Tom and I since. So I wasn’t on board with Toby’s suggestion. 

He brought Tom home with him one night to discuss it with me. I sat and listened and then Toby made a joke about us making the baby the old fashioned way as it was cheaper. I said no “Gross no thanks” and then Tom said how do you know we haven’t already had sec. I looked confused and he said when you are drunk you can’t tell us apart and us brothers like to share! I looked at Toby and he was laughing and nodding. I said that  I can tell them apart and I know my bf. But then Toby said that in the dark and being drunk I wouldn’t know. They intimated this had happened in the past! I was very angry! Then Tom added fuel to the fire saying that he wanted to be there to see “ our baby” being born and as I shouldn’t be embarrassed as he had seen what I have before then he winked at me. They were both laughing and I just left and went to bed in the spare room . I was furious and next day Toby kept it up. Laughing and saying “ oops you didn’t know which brother you had” . 

Now I know well I can tell them apart even if they do look very alike but there have been about 4 or 5 occasions that we did have sec when I was drunk and in the dark. Twice was in hotel rooms after friends weddings and the other times were just at home after hanging out with friends . So I’m just unsure. Also during that fun conversation Tom also inferred that he and Toby switched places to cover for Toby but wouldn’t say for what. It was to imply cheating. But as I say I know them apart but after two weeks of them keeping  up these jokes I started to second guess everything. Eventually I decided to go through all Toby’s devices. I needed to know if there was any grain of truth in either of these “jokes”. I found a text exchange on his iPad  where they appeared to be discussing hiding something but it’s pretty vague and the messages don’t go back very far at all.  This had been eating away at me and Toby is still keeping up this “ joke” at this stage . Eventually I planned to try to get his phone as I hadn’t looked there as I plotted ,I realized the depths of the paranoia and distress and anxiety I had sank to. The trust with Toby had just gone. 
And I told him straight that I was moving out to my friends house and that if he continued to infer that he allowed his brother to assault me without my consent I’d be going to the police about both of them.  He freaked out ! He said it was just a joke and I was taking it all too seriously. 
I couldn’t deal with him and left and went to stay with a friend. I feel I can’t tell anyone why I’ve left him though. He is saying I’m being ridiculous and unreasonable and wants me to come home. He says he will overlook me threatening to go to the police. 

Am I being unreasonable? Am I blowing this all out of proportion? I feel I’m so turned around that I don’t know. Tom weirdly hasn’t messaged or contacted me and I expected to get nasty messages from him but it’s been total silence from him. What do I do? ","kırılma noktasındayım f bfm toby ile yıllardır birlikteyiz toplamda geçen yıl bebek sahibi olmaya çalıştık ama şansımız yaver gitmedi sonunda test yaptırdık iyiyim ve toby gitti ve kısırlık sorunu olduğunu söyledi çok üzüldü daha iyimserdim evlat edinmeye çok açıktım birkaç hafta sonra bana toby'nin ikiz kardeşi tom olduğunu ve evet kardeşinin bebeğimizin biyolojik babası olmasını istediğini söyledi

mesele şu ki kardeşi toksik bir herif bir kadınla üç buluşmadan fazlasını asla geçiremiyor çünkü o bir herif hayatımızda her zaman olacağını kabul ettim çünkü o ve toby çok yakınlar toby ile tanıştığımda tom ülkenin diğer tarafında çalışıyordu ve iki yıl boyunca onunla şahsen tanışmadım bile ama toby tom ile birlikteyken farklı o da biraz toksik
tom geri döndükten sonra bir noktada benimle ilgili şakalar yapmaya başladı ama bunlar kötüydü ve toby güldü ve katıldı normalde sessizim ve çatışmacı değilim ama onlara patladı ve durdular ama o zamandan beri tom ve benim aramız iyi gitmedi bu yüzden toby'nin önerisine katılmadım

bir gece tom'u benimle tartışmak için eve getirdi oturdum dinledim ve sonra toby bebeği eski usulde yapmamızla ilgili bir şaka yaptı çünkü daha ucuzdu ben de hayır iğrenç değil teşekkürler dedim ve sonra tom daha önce hiç seks yapmadığımızı nereden biliyorsun dedi kafam karıştı ve sarhoşken bizi ayırt edemezsin dedi ve biz kardeşler paylaşmayı severiz dedi toby'ye baktım ve gülüyordu ve başını sallıyordu onları ayırt edebileceğimi ve erkek arkadaşımı tanıdığımı söyledim ama sonra toby karanlıkta ve sarhoşken bilemeyeceğimi söyledi bunun geçmişte olduğunu ima ettiler çok sinirlendim sonra tom ateşe benzin döktü bebeğimizin doğumunu görmek için orada olmak istediğini ve daha önce gördüklerimi gördüğü için utanmamam gerektiğini söyledi sonra bana göz kırptı ikisi de gülüyordu ve ben sadece ayrıldım ve misafir odasında yatağa gittim çok öfkeliydim ve ertesi gün toby devam etti gülerek ve oops hangi kardeşin olduğunu bilmiyordun diyerek 

şimdi iyi biliyorum ki onları birbirinden ayırt edebilirim çok benzeseler bile ama sarhoşken ve karanlıkta olduğumda iki kez arkadaşlarımın düğününden sonra otel odalarındayken ve diğer zamanlarda arkadaşlarımla takıldıktan sonra evde olduğumda birkaç kez seks yaptığımız durumlar oldu bu yüzden emin değilim ayrıca o eğlenceli sohbet sırasında tom da toby ile yer değiştirip toby'yi örtbas ettiklerini ima etti ama aldatmayı ima etmek için ne olduğunu söylemedi ama dediğim gibi onları birbirinden ayırıyorum ama iki hafta boyunca bu şakaları sürdürdükten sonra her şeyi sorgulamaya başladım sonunda toby'nin tüm cihazlarını karıştırmaya karar verdim bu şakalardan herhangi birinde bir gerçeklik payı olup olmadığını öğrenmem gerekiyordu ipad'inde bir mesaj alışverişi buldum orada bir şeyi saklamaktan bahsediyor gibi görünüyorlardı ama oldukça belirsizdi ve mesajlar çok eskiye gitmiyordu bu beni kemiriyordu ve toby hala bu şakayı sürdürüyor bu aşamada sonunda telefonunu almaya karar verdim çünkü planladığım gibi bakmamıştım ve fark ettim ki Toby ile olan güvenime battığım paranoya, sıkıntı ve kaygının derinlikleri yeni gitmişti
ve ona doğrudan arkadaşımın evine taşınacağımı ve eğer kardeşinin benim iznim olmadan bana saldırmasına izin verdiğini ima etmeye devam ederse ikisi hakkında da polise gideceğimi söyledim, çıldırdı, bunun sadece bir şaka olduğunu ve her şeyi çok ciddiye aldığımı söyledi
onunla başa çıkamadım ve ayrıldım ve bir arkadaşımın yanında kalmaya gittim, neden onu terk ettiğimi kimseye söyleyemediğimi hissediyorum, ancak saçma ve mantıksız olduğumu ve eve dönmemi istediğini söylüyor, beni görmezden geleceğini ve polise gitmekle tehdit ettiğini söylüyor

mantıksız mıyım, her şeyi abartıyor muyum, kendimi o kadar ters hissediyorum ki bilmiyorum tom garip bir şekilde bana mesaj atmadı veya benimle iletişime geçmedi ve ondan kötü mesajlar almayı bekliyordum ama ondan tamamen sessiz kaldı, ne yapmalıyım"
"we’ve been together for a  couple years and he just now told me he has a “sploshing” fetish, meaning he wants to smash a pie in my face, have a mud fight, get nickelodeon slimed together, etc.  i’m freaked out, this came out of the blue.  i don’t like being dirty/ messy at all, but he’s begging me to try at least one.  i’m so confused how he never told me sooner, and im a little grossed out by the concept, i don’t want to be covered in food or muck.   he said it’s important to him, but he waited this long to bring it up.  i don’t understand.  should i do it with him anyways?  if its important to him i guess i have to do it since it can’t hurt me but…  what do i even do in this situation?  

edit:  he wasn’t pressuring me in an unhealthy way, we talked it through better, i asked if lotion would work, he said sure.  smashed a “pie” (lotion in a pie tin) in his face, let him do it back to me.  it was pretty gross, you dont understand how much of a slimy mess a half a bottle of body cream can make until you’ve had it shoved in your face.  made him happy af though, and somehow it’s a good bonding moment to cuddle up together afterwards covered in the gunk.  can’t explain how. told him we’d try mud in the future since it’s a common spa treatment ","Birkaç yıldır birlikteyiz ve az önce bana sıçrama fetişi olduğunu söyledi, yani yüzüme pasta patlatmak, çamur savaşı yapmak, nickelodeon'la sümüklenmek vb. istiyor, çok korktum, bu aniden oldu, kirli ve dağınık olmayı hiç sevmem ama en azından birini denemem için yalvarıyor, bana daha önce nasıl söylemediğine çok şaşırdım ve bu kavramdan biraz iğrendim, yiyecek veya çamurla kaplanmak istemiyorum, bunun onun için önemli olduğunu söyledi ama bunu gündeme getirmek için bu kadar bekledi, anlamıyorum, bunu onunla yapmalı mıyım, zaten onun için önemliyse sanırım bana zarar veremeyeceği için yapmak zorundayım ama bu durumda ne yapabilirim ki?

düzenle, bana sağlıksız bir şekilde baskı yapmıyordu, konuştuk, daha iyi, losyonun işe yarayıp yaramayacağını sordum, evet dedi, pasta kutusunun içindeki pasta losyonunu yüzüne çarptım, bana geri yapmasına izin verdim, oldukça iğrençti, yarım şişe vücut kreminin ne kadar sümüklü bir karmaşa yaratabileceğini, onu alana kadar anlayamazsın yüzüne itilmek onu mutlu etti ve bir şekilde daha sonra birlikte sarılmak iyi bir bağ kurma anı oldu, pislik içindeydik, nasıl olduğunu açıklayamam, ona gelecekte yaygın bir spa tedavisi olduğu için çamuru deneyeceğimizi söyledim"
"A little while ago, my siblings and I discovered that my mother has a secret TikTok account that posts incredibly questionable content, ranging from 'cringeworthy but ultimately harmless' to 'borderline delusional'.

On the mild end are a series of girlboss-type posts about not letting the bastards grind you down. My mother has an extensive history of mental health issues, so it wouldn't be out of the ordinary to see these kinds of posts. Still, there's always an underlying insecurity in her captions, especially when they mention other men ghosting her, despite the fact she is married to my father and still living with us (my mother and father have a history of infidelity with one another, which our entire family is aware of, but I won't dwell on it for too long).

However, on the other end of the scale, there are posts about her completely made-up life. For context, she is an unemployed housewife, which has remained the case for the past twenty years. There's quite a lot to unpack regarding what she posts, so here's a lightning round of what she posts:

* Takes photos of other people's houses, saying they are properties she is considering buying.
* She calls her family vacations ""business trips"" and sometimes mentions her imaginary employees.
* She posts photos of expensive bags and jewellery that other men buy for her with the caption, ""Thank you for the gift! you know who you are...""
* She vents about the men who ghost her.
* She claims she has a PhD in Finance and a Bachelor's in Medicine, using a photo of my sibling's bachelor's degree, taken on the day of their own graduation, as proof.
* She tells her 300+ followers that she is losing a battle with cancer and is going to die by the end of the year, which is \*coincidentally\* the same situation one of her friends is in.

I have gone through many of the posts and can verify that she is the one running the account and that every significant detail of her life, from the business to the cancer diagnosis, is a lie. Outside of this account, my mother is an incredibly selfish and unstable person, who frequently lies and gets emotional if people do not appease her. She has refused to seek therapy and lives off of medication, taking them and falling asleep if anything upsets her. She lives a miserable life with no achievements or career of note, which was my theory as to why she created the account in the first place. It does appear to work, as her account is full of people showing sympathy and dudes trying to get her attention.

I apologise if this is a spiteful description of her, but the truth is that she is an utterly horrible person to be around, and I am not alone in this belief. My grandparents (mother's parents) are fully aware that she is seeing other men and want us to confront her about both her activity and the TikTok account. Any advice on the situation would be helpful, thank you.","bir süre önce kardeşlerim ve ben annemin inanılmaz derecede şüpheli içerikler yayınlayan gizli bir tiktok hesabı olduğunu keşfettik. Bu hesapta utanç verici ama nihayetinde zararsızdan sınırda sanrısal olana kadar değişen içerikler paylaşılıyor

hafif uçta, piçlerin sizi ezmesine izin vermemenizle ilgili bir dizi girlboss tipi gönderi var. Annemin kapsamlı bir ruh sağlığı sorunları geçmişi var, bu yüzden bu tür gönderileri görmek olağandışı olmazdı. Yine de altyazılarında her zaman gizli bir güvensizlik var. Özellikle de babamla evli olmasına ve hala bizimle yaşamasına rağmen onu hayalet gibi gören diğer erkeklerden bahsettiklerinde. Annem ve babamın birbirlerine karşı sadakatsizlik geçmişi var ve tüm ailemiz bunun farkında ancak bunun üzerinde çok durmayacağım

ancak ölçeğin diğer ucunda, bağlam için tamamen uydurduğu hayatıyla ilgili gönderiler var. İşsiz bir ev hanımı ve bu durum son yirmi yıldır böyle devam ediyor. Paylaştıklarıyla ilgili çözülmesi gereken çok şey var, bu yüzden paylaştıklarının kısa bir özetini aşağıda bulabilirsiniz

başkalarının evlerinin fotoğraflarını çekiyor ve bunların satın almayı düşündüğü mülkler olduğunu söylüyor
o Ailesinin tatillerini iş gezileri olarak adlandırıyor ve bazen hayali çalışanlarından bahsediyor
Başka erkeklerin onun için aldığı pahalı çantaların ve mücevherlerin fotoğraflarını, hediye için teşekkür ederim, kim olduğunu biliyorsun başlığıyla paylaşıyor
Kendisini hayaletleyen erkekler hakkında yakınıyor
Finans alanında doktorası ve tıp alanında lisansı olduğunu iddia ediyor ve bunu kanıt olarak da kardeşlerimin kendi mezuniyet günlerinde çekilmiş lisans derecesinin fotoğrafını kullanıyor
Takipçilerine kanserle mücadelesini kaybettiğini ve yıl sonuna kadar öleceğini söylüyor ki bu tesadüfen arkadaşlarından birinin içinde bulunduğu durumla aynı

Birçok gönderiyi okudum ve hesabı yönetenin o olduğunu ve işten kanser teşhisine kadar hayatının her önemli ayrıntısının bu hesap dışında bir yalan olduğunu doğrulayabiliyorum annem inanılmaz derecede bencil ve dengesiz bir insan, sık sık yalan söylüyor ve insanlar onu yatıştırmazsa duygusallaşıyor terapiye gitmeyi reddetti ve ilaçlarla yaşıyor, onları alıyor ve bir şey onu üzerse uyuyakalıyor sefil bir hayat yaşıyor, hiçbir başarısı veya kayda değer bir kariyeri yok, benim teorim bu ilk etapta hesabı oluşturdum, işe yarıyor gibi görünüyor çünkü hesabı sempati gösteren insanlarla ve dikkatini çekmeye çalışan adamlarla dolu

eğer bu onun hakkında kin dolu bir tanımlamaysa özür dilerim ama gerçek şu ki etrafında bulunması tamamen korkunç bir insan ve bu inancı taşıyan tek kişi ben değilim büyükannem, büyükbabam, anneannem ve dedem onun başka erkeklerle görüştüğünü tamamen biliyorlar ve hem aktiviteleri hem de tiktok hesabı hakkında onunla yüzleşmemizi istiyorlar. Durumla ilgili herhangi bir tavsiyeniz yardımcı olacaktır, teşekkür ederim"

So me and my husband just bought a house, and the lady we bought the house from actually moved a few houses over. She seemed like your typical sweet old lady, even left us house warming presents when we closed on the house. 

About two weeks of being in the house, my husband got the mail one day and some of it was hers. So he brought it down the road to her and dropped it off. 

Now We’ve been in the house about a month, and a few days ago me and my husband were outside about to mow the lawn. And she pulled up asking if we have been getting any of her mail. We said no, the only mail we got of hers, we had brought to her. And I said if we get any of your mail, we will keep bringing it to you.

Her exact response was “I checked your mailbox last week a few times for some bills I’m expecting.” 

Me and my husband both kinda looked at each other… and my husband said “again, if we get any of your mail we will bring it to you.” After she pulled away, I said to my husband: did she say what I think she said? Did she just tell us she’s been going thru our mailbox when we’re not home?? He’s like yup… it’s a very entitled way to act. I don’t know what makes her think. It’s OK to just roll up to OUR house and go through our mail just because she is waiting on some bills.  

So I started thinking, how much is she actually going to our mailbox when we are not home? My husband and I are both gone during the day.

So I thought that was the end of it. We told her repeatedly we would bring her any mail she gets….

Nope. I was standing in my kitchen yesterday and I had the front door open. Both mine and my husband’s vehicles in the driveway…. This lady pulls right up to our mailbox…. Pulls the mail into her car.. goes thru it… took some! (I’m assuming it was her mail) And put some back. Like no Shame. We’re both clearly home. So I got a picture of her reaching into the mailbox. 

What do I do in this situation? I know it’s illegal to even touch another persons mailbox.. unless you’re a postal worker. this lady is clearly not trying to hide it… and I don’t want to cause issues either because they are basically our neighbors. What should I do?","yani ben ve kocam yeni bir ev aldık ve evi aldığımız kadın aslında birkaç ev öteye taşındı, tipik tatlı yaşlı bir kadın gibi görünüyordu, hatta evi satın aldığımızda bize eve taşınma hediyeleri bile bıraktı

evde yaklaşık iki hafta kaldıktan sonra kocam bir gün postayı aldı ve bir kısmı ona aitti, bu yüzden postaları yolun aşağısına getirdi ve bıraktı

şimdi evde yaklaşık bir aydır ve birkaç gün önce kocam ve ben çimleri biçmek üzereydik ve gelip postalarından herhangi birini alıp almadığımızı sordu, hayır dedik, aldığımız tek postayı ona getirmiştik ve ben de postalarınızdan herhangi birini alırsak size getirmeye devam edeceğimizi söyledim

tam cevabı geçen hafta posta kutunuzu birkaç kez kontrol ettim, beklediğim bazı faturalar için

ben ve kocam birbirimize baktık ve kocam tekrar dedi, eğer postalarınızdan herhangi birini alırsak size getireceğiz, o uzaklaştıktan sonra kocama dedim ki, düşündüğüm şeyi söyledi mi? bize az önce yaşadığı şeyleri anlattı mı? posta kutumuz evde olmadığımızda o şöyle diyor evet bu çok haklı bir davranış şekli neden sadece bazı faturaları beklediği için evimize gelip postalarımızı karıştırmasının sorun olmadığını düşünmesine neden olan şeyi bilmiyorum

bu yüzden evde olmadığımızda posta kutumuza ne kadar gittiğini düşünmeye başladım kocam ve ben gün içinde ikimiz de evde değiliz

bu yüzden bunun son olduğunu düşündüm ona aldığı tüm postaları getireceğimizi defalarca söyledik

hayır dün mutfağımda duruyordum ve ön kapı açıktı hem benim hem de kocamın araçları garaj yolundaydı bu kadın posta kutumuza doğru yanaştı postayı arabasına aldı biraz zaman aldı sanırım postasıydı ve utanmadan birazını geri koydu ikisi de açıkça evdeydi bu yüzden posta kutusuna uzandığı bir fotoğrafını çektim

bu durumda ne yapmalıyım başka birinin posta kutusuna dokunmanın bile yasa dışı olduğunu biliyorum posta çalışanı değilseniz bu kadın açıkça saklamaya çalışmıyor ve ben de sorun çıkarmak istemiyorum çünkü onlar temelde komşularımız ne yapmalıyım"
"So I (F27) got a divorce about a year and a half ago. The only contact we've had was a brief text exchange about taxes so we could file. After handling our taxes I assumed we were done communicating and he was promptly blocked on most of my social media. I have also changed my number as I have moved to another state since the divorce. 

He (M26) recently DMed me on instagram stating he needs my information because he is applying for a law enforcement job. Apparently it's apart of the background check on him. He asked for my new number and current address. I don't feel comfortable providing him with this information as he is very narcissistic and owns many firearms. The firearms wouldn't be an issue if he hadnt put them to my head multiple times and shot his firearms off inside the house several times. 

I feel he is unfit for this position, but that is beside the point. For my own safety I dont feel comfortable providing him with this information. I am not sure what would be the best way to handle this. Any advice is appreciated. 


Update 1: After reading everyone's advice, I've decided to contact the police department directly. I left them a voicemail on my way home from work so hopefully they contact me back. If not I will try to call them again Monday morning. I have no intentions of responding to him further and I will give my information to the records department directly. If they ask about my experience with him then I will be honest, but if not all I will say is that I dont feel comfortable providing him with any of my personal information and ask that the department not provide it to him either.

I understand everyone is very concerned about him becoming a police officer, but please do understand that this behavior of his was years ago. I would like to hope that he is doing better mentally. I also don't want to get involved and have his current gf blast me all over Facebook. However, if anyone can think of ways for me to covertly drop hints to the PD that he is unfit then I am all ears. I just don't want to call them and start rambling about something they aren't asking. Then I come off as the crazy one.

Update 2: Here are just a few of the more serious things I think should be reported, but I am not sure what is too much and what is too little. Please help me figure out what I should say to them that will be honest, but not sound vindictive. 

Within a few months of the relationship he told me to just off myself if I was really depressed  while reaching over to the gas pedal. He was going to hit the gas pedal to ram the car into an RV that was in the yard.

He whipped our dog with a charger cable for pooping on the floor. 

He told me he offed someone and was doing trafficking in ATL. He later confessed this was a lie and he just wanted to seem cool. 

He told me he was a heroin addict for several years and then was addicted to popping pills while he was a teenager. 

He was arrested twice for Marijuana (illegal in the state he lives) but got off with youthful offender. One was going to be a felony charge for dabs. One of the arrests I was also apart of (not the one for dabs).

He was arrested again for a stolen firearm that he bought off Facebook. The charges were dropped after investigation. 

He has a violent temper that causes him to scream and hit things. He has broken doors, walls, and even several phones this way. 

He confessed that as a child he hated his step-dad so much for abusing him that he shot a hole in the side of his step-dad's bed. 

He tried to off himself several times to which I responded if he was going to off himself he might as well off me to. This is what prompted him to put the firearm to my head. He later tried to say I was never in any danger as the firearm wasn't loaded. This happened twice if I remember correctly. 

He has a medical condition that I feel could impact his ability to be an officer. (I am unsure if this is something I should mention as he is medicated now I believe).

He set off a firearm inside the home not once, but twice. One of which he admitted he was intoxicated. The house had his step-dad and brothers in it. 

He cheated 3 separate times within a 2 year time frame. (Again not really sure if I should mention this as it may come off as vindictive, but I feel it shows his character and untrustworthiness). 

He gets a concealed carry permit and takes his firearm into not one, but two off limit buildings stating it's an infringement on his 2nd amendment rights. One was a Goodwill and the other was a big city mall. 

After our divorce I was told he became a bit of an alcoholic showing his issue with substances is a continuous issue. 

He also chose to take on caring for a co-worker's dog. I was told by a friend (who is married to his brother) that the dog was often abandoned outside and chained up. It was often left without water. 

When he got his gf before his current he up and abandoned his youngest brother who had no way to fend for himself. Due to this my friend and her husband had to move in and take care of the youngest brother. 

Please help me decide what is too much and what definitely needs to be told to the PD. If you feel I should take the examples down I will do as instructed. I just don't want to see him hurt someone while out in the field.

"Hello friends of Reddit, I have a need for some advice.

I (39 female) and my husband (43 male), Are both in the film and television Industry. We work behind-the-scenes. My background is in costumes &amp; Voiceovers. His is on the directing side. 
After the horrendous writer/film strike Last year, We, like many others across the country in the film industry are struggling to make ends meet.
Luckily, my husband has actually been pretty successful with Uber and Lyft, where I on the other hand, have been pretty successful picking up odd jobs here and there. We've been able to pay our bills… but Barely. 
Recently, an agent friend of mine asked me if I wanted to do some voice work, reading erotic fiction for women. Flattered, I decided to do my own research into the company this would be for &amp; learned it's an all female owned company which prides themselves in safety and inclusivity, the pay is fantastic, and from what I read from some of their current VO actors, Everything is very professional And on the up and up. 
I want to send in my information ASAP! I think I would be really good at it and could possibly get consistent work. When I told my husband about it, his response was ""You can absolutely submit something and do that, but don't expect me to stick around… I will leave"". We argued about it a little while with him ending the conversation stating ""Put yourself in my shoes. How would you feel if I approached you asking to do the same thing?"" My response was ""I say go for it"", which in hindsight, may not have been the best response. Because his feelings were definitely hurt and he left the room.
 This VO work would just be a job. A very profitable job. VO work It's not like being on camera. nobody sees you and I'm playing/voicing a character. Like I do with most VO's I've done. 
We work in this business, He is well aware of the In-N-Outs And has never had a problem before because again… I am just playing/voicing a character. I really want to go forward and Submit something.
Any thoughts on how to approach this or seeing things from his eyes? Thank you much much appreciate","merhaba reddit dostları, biraz tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var

ben kadın ve kocam erkek, ikimiz de film ve televizyon sektöründeyiz, sahne arkasında çalışıyoruz, benim geçmişim kostüm ve seslendirmedir, onunki yönetmenlik tarafında

neyse ki kocam uber ve lyft ile oldukça başarılı oldu, ben ise burada ve orada tuhaf işler alarak oldukça başarılı oldum, faturalarımızı ödeyebildik ama zar zor
son zamanlarda bir ajan arkadaşım bana kadınlar için erotik kurgu okumak isteyip istemediğimi sordu, gurur duydum, şirket hakkında kendi araştırmamı yapmaya karar verdim, bunun için olacağını öğrendim, tamamen kadınlara ait bir şirket ve güvenlik ve kapsayıcılıkla övünüyorlar, maaşları harika ve şu anki seslendirme sanatçılarından bazılarından okuduğum kadarıyla her şey çok profesyonel ve düzgün
bilgilerimi en kısa sürede göndermek istiyorum, bence bunda gerçekten iyi olurum ve muhtemelen istikrarlı olabilirim kocama bundan bahsettiğimde verdiği cevap kesinlikle bir şey gönderebilir ve bunu yapabilirsin ama etrafta dolanmamı bekleme, ben gideceğim, biraz tartıştık ve konuşmayı bitirdiğinde kendini benim yerime koy, sana aynı şeyi yapmamı istesem nasıl hissederdin, cevabım ""hadi yap"" oldu, geriye dönüp baktığımda en iyi cevap olmayabilir çünkü duyguları kesinlikle incinmişti ve odadan çıktı

"UPDATE: 
Thank you all so much! I appreciate the feedback and I feel so validated. Just going to add some information and what my thoughts are from this point. My relationship with my FIANCE hasn't changed a bit. I never NEEDED my dads approval. I know it sounds dumb, but it just felt like something that needed to happen. After hearing his reasons, I absolutely don't need his approval and I wouldn't like anyone he would approve of anyway. I have apologized to my boyfriend profusely for this situation. I have also been doing my best to make him feel as amazing as he is. I am just really disappointed by my dad. I NEVER expected him to be so ignorant. I can't see us being nearly as close as we were. My fiancé and I are going on a road trip over the next week, just the two of us (that's when he intended on proposing). I'm excited to just enjoy this amazing human I get to spend the rest of my life with. 


I’m going to start off by saying that I wanted him to ask for his approval. The approval isn’t my deciding factor, but it was something I wanted. 

Long story short, today everything blew up. My boyfriend asked and my dad all but said no. I didn’t know anything was going on, until I received a text today asking how my boyfriend got my dad’s number. It didn’t take much for me to figure out why he was asking me that and I had a panic attack. I’m really close to my dad and I really wanted him to approve.  

Here’s why I’m asking for advice. I love my boyfriend. He’s hands down the most incredible man I’ve ever met. I won’t go on a rant about how great our relationship is, because honestly it’s not needed. 

I talked to my dad this afternoon and found out why he doesn’t approve. 

These are the reasons: 

- He struggles with social skills and should have gotten over that by now. 

- He doesn’t make enough money for me to not have to contribute to the household. 

- His job isn’t masculine. 

- He cried when he found out my dad didn’t approve because he knows how much it means to me and apparently that’s also not masculine. 

Although I am so angry that this whole surprise exciting moment has been ruined for me, after a few hours, I mostly feel better because I feel like these reasons are so ridiculous, but I just need an outsiders completely unbiased opinion. I never would have guessed that this would happen today. 

Some background info: 
We’ve lived together for a year and a half. We’re both adults over 25 (trying to stay somewhat anonymous). There has been no history of issues in our relationship (ex. Breaking up, infidelity, major fights, etc). We don’t have financial hardships. He’s respectful, kind, and humble and treats me like I hung the moon.","güncelleme

onay istemesini istediğimi söyleyerek başlayacağım onay benim karar verme faktörüm değil ama istediğim bir şeydi

uzun lafın kısası bugün her şey patladı erkek arkadaşım sordu ve babam neredeyse hayır dedi, bugün erkek arkadaşımın babamın numarasını nasıl bulduğunu soran bir mesaj alana kadar hiçbir şey olduğunu bilmiyordum, neden bana bunu sorduğunu anlamam uzun sürmedi ve panik atak geçirdim, babama çok yakınım ve gerçekten onaylamasını istiyordum

işte bu yüzden tavsiye istiyorum, erkek arkadaşımı seviyorum, tanıştığım en inanılmaz adam, ilişkimizin ne kadar harika olduğu hakkında bir nutuk atmayacağım çünkü dürüst olmak gerekirse buna gerek yok

bu öğleden sonra babamla konuştum ve neden onaylamadığını öğrendim

işte sebepleri

sosyal becerileriyle mücadele ediyor ve bunu artık atlatmış olmalıydı

ev işlerine katkıda bulunmamam için yeterli para kazanmıyor

işi erkeksi değil

babamın onaylamadığını öğrendiğinde ağladı çünkü bunun benim için ne kadar önemli olduğunu biliyor ve görünüşe göre bu da erkeksi değil

bu sürpriz heyecan verici anın benim için mahvolmuş olmasına çok sinirlensem de birkaç saat sonra kendimi daha iyi hissediyorum çünkü bu nedenlerin çok saçma olduğunu düşünüyorum ama sadece tarafsız bir yabancının görüşüne ihtiyacım var, bunun bugün olacağını asla tahmin edemezdim

"It was a normal day I am still a new teacher only my second year at this school, and coming into this year I was told about some specific trouble-making students. I didn't think anything of it until last Thursday when one of my students threw a used condom at me. It hit my head and then landed on my shoulder it was only after I picked it up I realized it was dry and disgusting and I immediately freaked out, started crying, and ran to the dean's office. They came in but no one fessed up and no one knew what to do so they got class detention for two days but that's it so far. Ever since I've been a laughing stock and heard jokes about myself that are about my body which are inappropriate immature. How can I discipline these students and make the one who did this fess up because I dread going every day and contemplate leaving?","normal bir gündü, hala yeni bir öğretmenim, bu okulda sadece ikinci yılım ve bu yıla girerken bana bazı özel sorun çıkaran öğrencilerden bahsedildi, geçen perşembe günü öğrencilerimden biri bana kullanılmış bir prezervatif fırlatana kadar hiçbir şey düşünmemiştim, kafamı çarptı ve sonra omzuma düştü, ancak onu aldıktan sonra kuru ve iğrenç olduğunu fark ettim ve hemen çıldırdım, ağlamaya başladım ve dekanın ofisine koştum, içeri girdiler ama kimse itiraf etmedi ve kimse ne yapacağını bilmiyordu, bu yüzden iki gün boyunca sınıfta kalma cezası aldılar ama şimdiye kadar hepsi bu, o zamandan beri alay konusu oldum ve kendim hakkında vücudumla ilgili uygunsuz ve olgunlaşmamış şakalar duydum, bu öğrencileri nasıl disiplin altına alabilirim ve bunu yapan kişiyi itiraf ettirebilirim çünkü her gün gitmekten korkuyorum ve ayrılmayı düşünüyorum"

My sister. It’s the second oldest here visiting, she’s 23. She is here rn and has been here now for a few days. When she first got here i arranged with her to arrive in the evening after the younger kids go to bed bc i thought it would be a bit much and knew she would be emotional. She was shaking when she arrived so defo the right call bc the little kids would have been freaked out. The first evening I was like hellll this is not gonna be good bc she was a serious wreck and wasnt sure she could stay. But then she slept on it and woke up way better and wasnt too emotional except at ‘meeting’ the younger ones since she hasnt seen them in so many years. Since then things have been good. Honestly it has been better than I thought and I feel kind of bad for dreading it so much. She is obviously different from her teenage self. She’s never been really maternal or anything and in my head that was a bad thing but it’s actually good bc she’s hanging out with the kids as a sister not a 3rd parent figure

16yr old is very similar in personality to her so she has enjoyed having her here and having an adult to talk to who isnt me or matt. 13yr old is clingy af recently and having my sister here means she has clung to her instead of me all the time. 12yr old is not impressed about having another girl in the house and says she stinks (of perfume yeah). 9yr old wants to know why she’s here and when she’s leaving and if she’s going to visit again  but when she isnt worrying she is having fun getting my sister to do different hairstyles for her. And 7yr old only has eyes for me and is totally psyched when all the others are hanging out with big sis so she can have me to herself. She did ask my sister to let her out of timeout and was best buddies with her for 10 minutes until she got over being annoyed with me 😂

I have got some time with my sister alone which has been nice to properly speak to her and get her opinion on some stuff and have her clear up things that happened with my dad. She defo has a lot of issues still but she is doing good for herself and pretty happy and isnt spiralling like our oldest sister. She pretty much said oldest sis has a lot of guilt issues for leaving and was expecting me to move in with her at 16 so is struggling a lot that I didnt and doesnt get how I was able to stay when she couldnt. Pretty sad hearing it tbh and I will defo talk to my oldest sister again and try help her but I dont want to get sucked in to being her therapist. 
Matt has got along with her fine too but they arent besties but they seem like they have put their issues aside and can handle being around eachother which they defo couldnt do a couple years back. Idk why exactly but seems like Matt and oldest sis had guilt issues and my other sister didnt (she has always been self centred but tbh it seems like that might be a good thing for her sake) and they had a lot of arguments about what they should and shouldnt be doing when they left. I think essentially middle sis was having too much fun and enjoying her life too much for the other two to handle bc they didnt think she gave a shit about the rest of us. Which she probably didnt but thats good for her i guess. Anyway she is staying for the week I think since its going pretty well 

Other things: 

My nan is still winding me tf up alllll the time. She whines at me daily about wanting my cousin to come live here and she threatens to kick us out all the time even tho she told our case worker we can live here as long as we need. Try not to waste my energy getting pissed off at her bc my patience is running thin as it is but jfc she is so annoying and so aggy bc shes offended that I told her she’s a shit parent and grandparent 

My mum may have found my dad. I only suspect it because she has been messaging me demanding photos of my 12 year old brother, and chances are she just wants to show my dad that he looks like him. She only gives a shit about her kids when she’s trying to use them to make our dad love her. I told her to go fuck herself bc I’m not sending her any photos. Like get a fucking grip if you dont already have photos of your own child on your phone thats a you problem. She has been a bitch to him his entire life anyway (if dad leaves soon after you’re born or whilst she’s still pregnant with you, you’re in her bad books for life. 22, me, 16, 12 and 7 were all in the bad books before we could hold our own heads up. And the oldest 2 are in the bad books for not being quiet about him abusing them and letting it continue so my mum could live her dream of having my dad at home). 

Also should mention my dad has other kids. Idk how many and I have never met them but he has mentioned them before and I thought they may have been made up but my sister said one of them contacted her ages ago so they defo exist. 

7 year old has been calling me mummy. I have mixed feelings about it. I feel bad that this little kid has to resort to calling a 20 year old mess mummy. It has made it feel a lot more real like damn I really am all these kids have at this point. I know my mum would never sort herself out but deep down I guess I felt like I’m the temporary guardian and now I’ve fully realised no one is coming to take over at any point. I knew that but idk if it had clicked until a few days of the teeny monster calling me mummy. I’m happy that she has someone she can call mummy though. She wouldn’t have that in foster care so that makes me feel better. It would be really fucking sad if she had no one to call mummy at 7 years old. 9 year old has been a bit upset about it bc I think she wants to call me it as well but it feels a bit uncomfortable for her. She keeps crying saying she wants me to be her mum too but I’m not her mum and she doesn’t know what to do. Ofc i have told her she can call me what she wants  and it wont change the fact I will look after her and be there for her the same either way 

I am kind of worried 7yr old is going to start calling Matt dad bc she is deep in her wanting a dad era and DESPERATE for a dad. Talks about it a lot and asks about having a dad daily. Which triggers the other kids who hate our dad. So idk if it will go down well if she starts calling bro dad. And I feel like it will be weird for her to refer to us both like that when we are siblings. But I dont want to tell her she cant either. She hasnt done it yet but I can see her edging towards it. She asked me if I was going to marry Matt so he could be the dad. And he is so good with her. I heard him singing to her the other night. So ofc she’s in loveee

With 16yr old I have found it easier if Matt does all the tough parenting shit and I act like I’m on her side kind of. Ofc he knows I’m not really but she doesnt want me parenting her so instead of trying to force it on her I’m trying to be more like just a sibling and he is the bad guy. It doesnt work out perfectly and I still get pissed off at her but mostly only when she does something to interfere with me parenting the other 4. Like 7yr old has her “lovies” (old muslin cloths) she is very attached to and 16yr old confiscated one of them and wouldnt give it back and I had to tell her you dont confiscate shit and force her to give it back by threatening to take her phone. But other stuff I leave to Matt. He is less bothered by the psychological bs with her. He just gets annoyed when i have an attitude with him and she overhears and copies me lol

Its been a lot of trial and error figuring out how to deal with everyone bc like 13yr old is my shadow and does not react well to Matt disciplining her at all but is fine if I do it. And 12yr old is one extreme or the other. Would tell me to fuck off but would cry when Matt tells him off for it. He listens to me better now but only when I grab him and make him look at me whilst I speak bc he is the master of tuning me out. He cuddles me when no one else is around tho and if Matt disciplines him he comes to me crying. 9yr old is a perfect angel until she isnt and decides to have a 30 minute battle with us bc she doesnt want to brush her teeth for no actual reason. She kind of reminds me of myself as a kid trying to keep it all together all the time, but she is safe enough to then let it all out in a meltdown. Mostly she’s pretty easy bc shes reasonable but sometimes she does go full demonic and tests our patience

To everyone messaging me saying 7yr old sounds autistic, she’s not. I’ve discussed it with the doctor and the therapist. She’s got anxiety and abandonment issues and is very stressed in general which is why she cant let herself lose control and fall asleep. But she was not like this before my mum left at all. She used to sleep fine. All of them struggle with food bc they have been eating ramen their whole lives but its harder to get 7yr old to eat better. The older ones I can explain it a bit better that they need the nutrition and they will try and eat more. But she doesnt give a fuckkk about nutrition. And she’s crazy attached to me bc she thinks I will leave obviously. She has tabs on me constantly. But in theory that should all pass with time and reassurance   

Matt has been really good at not being like our parents were with us. He walks away a lot when he gets pissed off bc he doesnt want to react badly to the kids. He hasnt smacked anyone since our big argument about it which tbh is impressive considering how it was for us as kids. He literally has scars from my dads beatings and my mum has broken multiple bones on a few different kids. So trying not to be physical at all when thats what you’re used to is hard but we are doing it. 

I’m chilling out a bit now with letting him actually parent and not intervening all the time. Like a while ago we were having a terrible night with 7yr old and she was still screaming at about 2am, Matt came to get her off me bc I was about to lose it and as he picked her up she was flipping out and accidentally headbutted him full in the face. I basically went blind and grabbed her off him so fast bc if that was my dad he literally would have thrown her across the room and she’d be in hospital. But Matt just sat on the floor silently and held his nose for a while. And I was like okkk wtf he didnt even seemed pissed off. So a couple more situations like that and now I’m not so crazy in protection mode and feel like I can trust him 

Anyway this is a lot a longer than I planned yet again. Cant stop writing when I start even though these updates take me dayyys","my sister its the second oldest here visiting shes  she is here rn and has been here now for a few days when she first got here i arranged with her to arrive in the evening after the younger kids go to bed bc i thought it would be a bit much and knew she would be emotional she was shaking when she arrived so defo the right call bc the little kids would have been freaked out the first evening i was like hellll this is not gonna be good bc she was a serious wreck and wasnt sure she could stay but then she slept on it and woke up way better and wasnt too emotional except at meeting the younger ones since she hasnt seen them in so many years since then things have been good honestly it has been better than i thought and i feel kind of bad for dreading it so much she is obviously different from her teenage self shes never been really maternal or anything and in my head that was a bad thing but its actually good bc shes hanging out with the kids as a sister not a rd parent figure

"I’m a very very VERY white woman, with a very unique problem.

When I was a child I had straight platinum blonde hair, my grandmother used to call me a toe head. But once I hit puberty, my hair turned a very dark brown, and now I have A,B, and C 3 curls with the occasional 4 A sprinkled in. It’s very thick, heavy, and course. There’s no rhym or reason to my curl pattern, and it was a matted mess before I joined an African choir (I live in a predominantly black community, and sing in Swahili) where the lovely African American moms stepped in and helped me.

After I was recommended products and brushes, I went to stores they recommended to pick up supplies, and on more then one occasion have been shouted, screamed at, and harassed because I was a white girl who had to have gotten a perm, or was faking having this hair because it’s not mine, and that’s racist. I was belittled and screamed at so bad I started crying, then was yelled at for “being a little white victim”, I was 13. This has happened at least four times, untill some of the sweet AAmoms offering to take me or buy me supplies.

Eventually they started carrying brands I use at Walmart, so I piece together my hair supplies without going near beauty stores.

Now that I’m a full grown woman same hair but it’s about 4 feet long when I pull it straight, 1.6 if I’m lucky curled. I mostly keep it up. But now I have never been harassed more online or at my work place about being racist with my hair.

The most recent comment being “black woman dont have to curl chile” because I made a comment on a music video about being excited for an upcoming album and my pfp is a headshot. Some of the college people I work with assume I’m black, which has led to a lot of very awkward conversations. HR even had to ask about my hair as some students thought I was racist.

This doesn’t happen often, but I do want to be careful, as this is a part of me (literally) and represents a people I am not apart of. So what can I do to stop this, or address it properly?

I can’t straighten my hair, as it takes about three hours each time, and curls back almost instantly. I’ve tried chemical straightening, but it did not stick. I really do love my hair, I’m just worried is all.","ben çok çok çok beyaz bir kadınım ve çok özel bir sorunum var

çocukken düz platin sarısı saçlarım vardı büyükannem bana ayak başı derdi ama ergenliğe girdiğimde saçlarım çok koyu kahverengiye döndü ve şimdi ara sıra a serpiştirilmiş a ve c buklelerim var çok kalın ve tabii ki buklelerimin hiçbir mantığı veya nedeni yok ve bir afrika korosuna katılmadan önce keçeleşmiş bir karmaşaydı ağırlıklı olarak siyahların yaşadığı bir toplulukta yaşıyorum ve swahili dilinde şarkı söylüyorum burada sevimli afrikalı amerikalı anneler devreye girip bana yardım etti

ürünler ve fırçalar önerildikten sonra malzemeleri almak için önerdikleri mağazalara gittim ve birden fazla kez beyaz bir kız olduğum için bağırıldım, bağırdım ve taciz edildim çünkü perma yaptırmak zorunda kaldım veya bu saç benim değil ve bu ırkçılık olduğu için bu saçı taklidi yapıyordum küçümsendim ve çok fazla bağırıldım ağlamaya başladım sonra küçük bir beyaz kurban olduğum için bana bağırıldı bu en az dört kez oldu ta ki tatlı amomlardan bazıları beni almaya teklif edene kadar ya da bana malzeme al

sonunda walmart'ta kullandığım markaları taşımaya başladılar bu yüzden güzellik mağazalarına gitmeden saç malzemelerimi bir araya getiriyorum

şimdi artık yetişkin bir kadınım aynı saç ama düzleştirdiğimde yaklaşık bir ayak uzunluğunda oluyor eğer şanslıysam kıvırcık saçlarımı çoğunlukla uzatıyorum ama şimdi hiç bu kadar çevrimiçi veya iş yerimde saçlarımla ilgili ırkçı olduğum için taciz edilmedim

en son yorum siyah bir kadın olduğum için kıvırcık saç yapmak zorunda değilsin çünkü yaklaşan bir albüm için heyecanlı olduğumu anlatan bir müzik videosuna yorum yaptım ve pfp'im bir baş çekimi birlikte çalıştığım üniversitelilerden bazıları siyah olduğumu varsayıyor bu da çok garip konuşmalara yol açtı hatta bazı öğrenciler ırkçı olduğumu düşündüğü için saçlarım hakkında soru sormak zorunda kaldı

bu sık sık olmuyor ama dikkatli olmak istiyorum çünkü bu kelimenin tam anlamıyla benim bir parçam ve parçası olmadığım bir halkı temsil ediyor peki bunu durdurmak veya düzgün bir şekilde ele almak için ne yapabilirim

saçımı düzleştiremiyorum çünkü her seferinde yaklaşık üç saat sürüyor ve hemen hemen anında kıvrılıyor kimyasal düzleştirmeyi denedim ama tutmadı gerçekten çok seviyorum saçlarım sadece endişeleniyorum hepsi bu"
"This happened a few months ago but I just found out today what it actually means...


My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. He's normally very sweet and kind and isn't the type of person who would say something to purposefully hurt my feelings. 


I don't remember how we got on this topic because it was a few months ago....but he jokingly said that my vagina was like a roast beef sandwich 😭 I remember initially getting a little upset by him saying this because I just didn't want my vag to be compared to that. I already have insecurities about that body part and it didn't sound like a very pleasant thing for it to be compared to. 


Fast forward to today....I over heard some coworkers of mine talking and they were saying that if your vagina gets compared to a roast beef sandwich it means that it is bad and that you don't like it.


Now I'm so scared that my boyfriend thinks my vagina is gross.

Have any other gals on here dealt with this? Should I bring this up to my boyfriend even though this was said over a few months ago?","bu birkaç ay önce oldu ama bugün bunun gerçekte ne anlama geldiğini öğrendim

"So I work at a Hospital and am the assistant of the manager. I need two years of experience before I can become manager myself. One of the workers of a different department and I hit it Off pretty fast and we became close. Before we could become intimate I thought about how wrong it is to shit where I eat and since I am „above“ her in the hierarchy it would be a really Bad outlook for me and my image. Naturally I cut it off after we hung out once. I didnt fuck her. I didnt Kiss her. I didnt touch her. Now After a couple of weeks she told everybody that she is pregnant and that she is unsure if I am the father because I could be. Now the rumours took off and I couldt stop it and I dont know what to do. When someone talked to me about it I Said that it cant be but Im the new guy Here and everyone in her department already made up their mind that I fucked her. Why would anybody do such a thing I dont understand? Do I confront her ? Do I just let it die down. She isnt working Here anymore btw.

Edit: thanks guys for all of you who took the time out of their day to help me. it somewhat restored my faith in humans after all this crap Im going through. I would like  to answer all of you individually but theres too many comments. Also Many Are saying the same thing regarding hr.

"I know that what I’m about to write is going to sound absolutely insane. I’m still having a hard time believing it’s real myself. It’s going to be a really long post so please bear with me because I’m desperate and I really need some advice. I (23F) was struggling with alcoholism for about 4 years. My brother has his own local detailing business and through that, he met this guy (66M) who is a licensed therapist that specializes in addiction and trauma. My brother told me about him and put us in contact with each other and just from my first conversation with him I thought this guy was going to be my savior. He shared his story with me about how he himself was an addict for 20+ years and when he got sober, he decided to go back to school to become a therapist to try and help other people do the same. Now, he works with a recovery program that meets for group 3 times a week and each person in group meets with him for one-on-ones once a week. I started the program 2 months ago and absolutely fell in love with it. I changed my work schedule around so that I could make it to the group meetings and I got excited to go because it was really helping me stay sober and I was learning so much from him and from the other members. This was my first time doing a recovery program and fully committing to therapy. I had tried therapy before but never worked with anyone qualified to handle the intense things I was coming to them with. Because of his past and the fact that he specialized in trauma and addiction, I trusted him with very personal details about me and my life.

2 weeks ago we were scheduled to have a meeting at his office which he changed and asked if we could meet at his apartment instead. He said the office was being sprayed for bugs and needed to air out and that if I was uncomfortable meeting at his apartment then we could meet over zoom. I’m not looking for any judgement please, I know I shouldn’t have gone over there but hindsight is always 20/20. He was my therapist, someone that I should be able to fully trust and I did. He never gave me a reason not to. So, we met at his apartment and the session was normal other than one thing. He asked me about my sexuality which I told him that I was bisexual. It never came up before this and him asking about that directed our conversation to sex in general. I told him about my past sexual traumas and how they have led me to have a hard time with intimacy, even just being intimate with myself is a struggle sometimes. I never thought anything was off really, you’re supposed to be able to talk to your therapist about anything, right?

Fast forward to the day before yesterday, we had our group meeting and at the end he reminded me that me and him have our one-on-one the next day. He said “do you want to talk about what we did last time? Is it still a problem for you?” And it took me a second to remember what we talked about last time because, like I said, that was two weeks ago but I just said sure. So yesterday, he asked that we meet at his apartment again because he said he was having issues with his car. When I got there, he told me his car was fine actually, it just wouldn’t start because he needed to change the battery in his key fob, but since I was already there, we would just do the session there. I thought it was a little odd but still, no real signs of concern in my eyes. 

We start off the session by talking about my week like usual. It was a stressful one because while I was out of town for a concert I got a text from my apartment complex that I had to move out of my apartment unexpectedly. I had to cut the trip early and come back to do that so I was telling him about that a little bit and out of no where he just goes “so let’s talk about the sex thing.” It caught me a little off guard, but I just said “oh, okay” and we started talking more about it, where we left off last session. I was telling him about how I don’t want to struggle with intimacy forever because I know I’ll have a partner one day and I don’t want them to leave me because I can’t be physical with them. While I was expressing some of these fears and concerns to him about it he cut me off mid sentence to say that he thought I wasn’t being able to fully open up to him. That I still felt shy and uncomfortable sharing things with him. When really, I didn’t want to talk specifics about my sex dreams, fantasies, kinks etc. like he kept asking about. I just was wanting to talk about some of my worries I guess. 

So he said he wanted to show me something and he brought me into his bedroom. He showed me that on his bed he had black Velcro restraints on the headboard and foot of his bed. He asked me if I knew what they were and I said yes and he used that opportunity to tell me he was into BDSM and that he was a Dom. He said he wanted to share that with me because he wanted me to feel like there was nothing to hide from him because he had seen it all and that he wouldn’t judge me for whatever I told him. We went back into his living room and continued to talk about it. By this point I was feeling a little bit uncomfortable, but how was I supposed to do anything when I was alone with him and he just showed me he had restraints on his bed? So even when he asked me if I felt uncomfortable how was I supposed to say yes? He then started talking about his wife and how she knows about his “lifestyle” and that she’s okay with it but isn’t into it. He talked about how they’ve been married for so long but they’re just “good friends” now and they don’t have sex anymore. He seemed like he was fishing for comfort in that, and I didn’t really know what to say to him. 

He stopped for a second and looked like he was trying to seem convicted about what he was going to say next. He said that what he was about to ask me could ruin his relationship with his wife, kids, mom, and could ruin his career. He said “would you want to let me help you work through these problems with sex?” I felt like the walls were closing in on me, like I was going to throw up, pass out, scream, I don’t know. I asked him to elaborate on what he meant by that because I needed him to clearly spell out what he was asking. Then he said “I want you to know I’m very attracted to you, and I want you to let me help you through this…physically and emotionally.” I didn’t know what to say to that. I guess he could tell by the look on my face what I was feeling because he immediately just started saying “oh my god I shouldn’t have said that” “I’m so embarrassed” and “please forget I said anything” but how the fuck am I supposed to forget that? 

I just told him that it was okay and that I wouldn’t tell anyone but what else was I supposed to say? He just showed me restraints he had in his bedroom and told me he was into BDSM, plus, he just put his livelihood on the line to ask me to fuck him and there’s no telling what he could’ve done to me out of desperation in order to protect himself. He kept pressing me to share more with him after that and when we finally landed on that the root of my problem with sex was a mixture of trust and self image issues, he started explaining to me how the main attraction behind BDSM and having a Dom is being able to trust. He asked me if I trusted him to which I said yes because I did. He was the only man outside of my family that I trusted and I had been extremely vulnerable with him about very intimate things. He then began showering me with compliments and saying how he couldn’t comprehend that I would struggle with self confidence. He told how much he liked my body and my smile. He told me that he feels like he could trust me with anything and that I have a good heart and that’s what’s most attractive about me. He told me that I should be confident in my body because he just risked his whole life and career to “just experience it.” It just felt like he led me to the conclusions of self confidence and trust being the problem so that he could provide himself as the solution. 

By the end of every session he always gives me something to try and focus and work on for the next week. This time, he told me that I should masturbate at least once a day, every day, for the next week. He said that it would help me feel more comfortable with my body by conditioning it and making myself “feel good.” When I was leaving he hugged me while I just stood there still. He said “if you ever change your mind, my door is always unlocked” and then he laughed and said “see you at group tonight kiddo.” I truly felt so sick when I was walking to my car. I immediately went to my sister’s apartment that was nearby and just broke down to her and told her everything. She said I need to go to the police but I don’t know if they can do anything. I just feel so betrayed and taken advantage of. It’s been such a rough journey to get sober and I have been for 58 days now, but this is just so devastating. I don’t know how to tell the others in our group because they idolize him. Especially the only other girl in our group, I’m pretty close with her but she has had a really hard time with her journey to sobriety and if he is helping her get sober, I don’t want this to ruin that for her. But then again, what if he tries to do something with her and it fucks her up even more? I’m just so conflicted and I don’t know what to do. I know he is going through a lot with his mother’s health and him and his family have already been through so much. I’m trying not to let his guilt tripping tactics of bringing up his family and career get to me but it’s hard not to. I know this sounds selfish but I don’t want this obligation of being the person that has to do something about this. I just wish it never happened and that he kept his perverted thoughts to himself. But I don’t want him to be able to hurt anyone else by doing this and there’s no telling how many women he’s tried to do this to before me. I really need advice. Please help me. 

Edit: I’ve never posted on Reddit before this but after this happened I wasn’t sure what to do. I said this in a comment before but I downloaded Reddit for the first time when I was thinking about starting my sobriety journey. I loved reading other people’s stories of how they got sober or saw other people get sober, it was encouraging and refreshing. I made this post to get advice and also just to get all of the events written down while they were still fresh on my mind. I did not expect the overwhelming support and love from all of you. When I first made this post I wasn’t sure I wanted to report this man but I am 100% sure that I’m going to now. You all gave me the courage I needed and I can’t even express how appreciative I am of that. Thank you guys so so much, love you bunches❤️big hugs friends🤗 ","i know that what im about to write is going to sound absolutely insane im still having a hard time believing its real myself its going to be a really long post so please bear with me because im desperate and i really need some advice i f was struggling with alcoholism for about  years my brother has his own local detailing business and through that he met this guy m who is a licensed therapist that specializes in addiction and trauma my brother told me about him and put us in contact with each other and just from my first conversation with him i thought this guy was going to be my savior he shared his story with me about how he himself was an addict for  years and when he got sober he decided to go back to school to become a therapist to try and help other people do the same now he works with a recovery program that meets for group  times a week and each person in group meets with him for oneonones once a week i started the program  months ago and absolutely fell in love with it i changed my work schedule around so that i could make it to the group meetings and i got excited to go because it was really helping me stay sober and i was learning so much from him and from the other members this was my first time doing a recovery program and fully committing to therapy i had tried therapy before but never worked with anyone qualified to handle the intense things i was coming to them with because of his past and the fact that he specialized in trauma and addiction i trusted him with very personal details about me and my life

 weeks ago we were scheduled to have a meeting at his office which he changed and asked if we could meet at his apartment instead he said the office was being sprayed for bugs and needed to air out and that if i was uncomfortable meeting at his apartment then we could meet over zoom im not looking for any judgement please i know i shouldnt have gone over there but hindsight is always  he was my therapist someone that i should be able to fully trust and i did he never gave me a reason not to so we met at his apartment and the session was normal other than one thing he asked me about my sexuality which i told him that i was bisexual it never came up before this and him asking about that directed our conversation to sex in general i told him about my past sexual traumas and how they have led me to have a hard time with intimacy even just being intimate with myself is a struggle sometimes i never thought anything was off really youre supposed to be able to talk to your therapist about anything right

"My (21M) girlfriend (20F) and I have sex regularly, but have never had oral sex. I know she'd love for me to go down on her, but I can't deal with the smell. It's a very strong, sour smell of sweat and iron. I showed her after I fingered her, and even she had to gag.

Whenever we shower together, she doesn't really clean down there, which I suspect has something to do with the smell...

My parents don't let me eat past 8.30pm, it's getting to the point where I am incredibly hungry on a night (I go to bed between 10.45pm and 11.30pm) but I am not allowed absolutely any food, healthy or otherwise. I can't sneak food, because I regularly get caught and told off, but I'm not sure what to do. I'm already slim, so it's not as though I am on a diet, and I wake up in the night hungry. I already struggle with bowel issues and my doctors recommended I eat small amounts of food regularly, but I'm NOT ALLOWED. someone please give me advice, I don't know what to do, and not eating is resulting in me being uncomfortable and in pain. P.S My parents are incredibly strict but I don't understand why I'm not allowed to eat??

Update: for anyone responding, I live in the UK (in England more precisely) not USA. Thank you for all the support. ​

UPDATE 2.0: So, unfortunately, amongst losing weight (only 1lb every couple of days right now), ive since become deficient in B12 and vitamin D. Hopefully the doctors will question that considering I'm absorbing it through medication but not as soon as I'm taken off them due to my diet. I've also started talking to my school's councilor, who's considering safeguarding our conversation, however I'm quite worried about their reaction as they can already be quite violent with my younger brother so it's all very quiet for now. Thank you for all the support, it really means a lot to me. This is strange as since these things have happened my whole life, its as though I don't recognize it as abuse if that makes sense? Like, I know logically that it is, but to my brain its just normality.

First off thank you guys for the comments and advice about my original post, so I have an update for you guys. 
So I went this morning for the baptism and I asked my cousin what did she name the baby (just to confirm) ,so she has named him Loveda( even I don’t understand what type of a name that is) but when u say it with a malayali accent it sounds like lauda. I guess she could sense that I didn’t like the name and I could sense a bit of hostility from her. So I just said , ”what does it mean”, then she looked at me like I was dumb and said “ do you not know what ‘Love’ means ?”. So yeah things got awkward so I left .
But I told my mom that it’s not right for us to just stand by while we know what it means, sooo, I kinda forced her to tell the baby’s grandpa (who btw knew a bit of Hindi and doesn’t get offended like the rest of the family does). So we told him what it sounds like, and that innocent man had no clue what it meant. And in the middle of us uncomfortably explaining him what it means, my grandpa joined the conversation and surprisingly he didn’t scold me or my mom, but he took that man aside and told him what it really means  and how terrible it sounds. That poor man looked soo uncomfortable,but he said he will talk to his daughter, and admitted that he never really like the name in the first place. 
So now it’s in his hands if he tells or not. 
I just really hope they change the name .","orijinal gönderi httpswwwredditcomradvicesoefouyhyho

"Hello

I (29M) made a critical blunder. Recently got into a relationship with my GF (31F). We just started working in the same department and hit it off. I left the company and shot my shot on the way out. Anyways, we've been together for about 5 months now. Recently, she commented how I didn't do oral often. Honestly, I don't have much in the way of dating or relationship experience. I told her, without thinking, that it was a strong smell/taste and I'm quite sensitive to that stuff. Really, I don't have much experience with oral so not all that sure what normal is. It's not something that I'm used to, maybe it's an acquired interest? Obviously, saying this cut deep. 

How do I make things up to her? I'm worried I fucked up pretty badly here. 

Please help me gentlemen (and ladies!).","merhaba

"I 30f have a son 14m. Last week my boyfriend was helping my son with something on the computer and caught a glance of his email and it had mom p*rn sites in the inbox. I don't know what to do and I feel terrible because I don't know if I did something wrong. He even has a game tag that suggests he has a mom fetish. I feel guilty because I don't see my son as my child but more as a predator. I had occasionally found a pair of my underwear in his room but i didn't think anything bad of it because our laundry gets mixed together and i had no reason to believe something nefarious was happening. I don't fear him or anything and he's never tried to inappropriately touch me or anyone or stare, this caught me completely by suprise. I've had family members sexualize and abuse me in the past and now my brain wants to lump him in that category even though he has done nothing wrong towards me.

"I (18M) was invited to a house party but declined to go out with my mates, the girl (17F) had kept inviting me to her house to attend the party but I kept saying no so I could spend time with my mates because Im being deployed in a few months overseas. I eventually gave in after being under the influence of a lot of alcohol, walked to her house since it was only a short distance away. 

People later left and I was one of the only few remaining where the girl and I went into her bedroom and engaged in sexual activity. After sex, I then left to return home. Today (Tuesday) I received a text saying that I had used her and that she was drunk while it happened. She has later on told mutual friends and classmates making it sound like I had raped her.

"My gf and I have been together for a little over a year now, and she frequently stays at mine since I live alone and she doesn't. Recently, she started having really heavy periods (heavy to the point of seeing a gyn for it). She does everything she can to avoid bleeding though, but despite her best efforts, it's happened a couple times now, and each time she freaks out, cries, and obsessively apologizes. The thing is, the bleeding through doesn’t bother me at all, and I couldn’t care less. It's part of life, and with the heaviness, I honestly expected it. I remind her that sheets are replaceable, and when she talks about the mattress, I remind her that I've had a protective cover on it since I bought it. I always make it clear to her that it doesn’t bother me and I'm not disgusted by it. The process I have now is talking her down, starting the shower, taking her clothes, stripping the bed, making the bed, cleaning whatever needs to be cleaned, then going into the bathroom to sit and talk to her while she showers, then holding her till she falls asleep. I just want her to understand that when it happens, my concern is making her comfortable, not whether my sheets will stain or be ruined. I know that her frustration, exhaustion, and insecurities about the issues play a part in this.


I apologize for the long update. 
 
I want to thank everyone for the recommendations and reassurance that I'm doing everything right. We had a sit-down, and she opened up about past situations of being shamed and scolded for bleeding through, and most were high school horror stories. She talked about how she was yelled at by an ex-partner over a small spot when she started early in the middle of the night. I know I'm not her therapist, but the ‘you can tell me anything’ line of communication is extremely important, even when it’s something I can't directly help with or can only offer support. As for diapers and period underwear, she's been looking into them. I told her that if she's hesitant about using them out of embarrassment and insecurity, I'd wear one with her to settle her nerves lol. She agreed that the potty pads are also something she's willing to try as long as I’m comfortable with them since it's my bed, which I am. As for the blanket someone recommended and the towels, she has sensory issues, and it just wouldn’t be comfortable for her depending on the textures and bunching throughout the night. Its a concern with the potty pads too. As far as diagnosis, she got her ultrasound results back, and she has ovarian cysts, a polyp, and the gyn told her she has a thickened endo layer. She also had an endo biopsy that showed some abnormal tissue and fibrous cells. The recommendation right now is a complete d&amp;c, polyp removal, iud placement, and Nexplanon removal. I did tell her about the post and showed her. She found the assert dominance comments amusing and assured me I'm doing everything perfectly, and a lot of her reaction is her being in her head, but I’m helping her understand it's not something to be ashamed of.

"My guy friend got drunk over a glass of wine, and was throwing up all night. My other friend (girl) was also quite drunk but didn’t vomit, so I looked after both of them.

The guy friend kept flipping on his back so I kept trying to put him on his side so he doesn’t choke and die on his vomit.
He kept vomiting till 5am, and I was so sleepy.
So we all slept on the same bed.
I put a suitcase between me and him so he would not flip on his back. 

My boyfriend says this was not right, it was my friend’s responsibility not mine, he shouldn’t have got that drunk. My boyfriend says I should have let my guy friend sleep on his bed alone, regardless of him flipping over.

He says that he feels uncomfortable with me sleeping in the same bed as a guy. 

But I would have felt terrible if something happened to my friend and I wasn’t there to look after them. 

My boyfriend reckons this was a form of cheating?

"I’m 26M.  In 2018 (I was 20), four guys held me down and one of them shoved a rake up my butt.  It was by far the worst experience I’ve had and probably ever will have, and I was only 20.  I had no support from my family except my mother.  My dad completely said he “failed to raise a man, and that I’m not a real man because I was raped.”  I do not speak to my father anymore.  His entire side of the family was equally unwilling to help me go through that time.

My mother divorced him, not long after.  She let me live with her as long as I paid rent.

I was traumatized for years.  I’ve spent my entire 20s in and out of mental health facilities.  Recently I just got my license to be a realtor, at 26.  Can’t help but feel far behind everyone.  I’m not sure when I’ll be able to move out from my mother’s place, or get a girlfriend (haven’t even had sex other than once at age 17, so I probably will suck at it).  And when I’ll be able to catch up to my peers financially.

I feel like a loser even though this wasn’t my fault.  Should I feel like one?

"Hi everybody, so yeah, like the title says. I (28M) have been dating my girlfriend (28F) for over three years now. In most ways it's an incredible relationship - we love and support each other, and she's kind to me, beautiful, funny, and easy to get along with. We rarely fight.

The only question mark in the relationship is sex. I'll be honest, we've never really clicked completely in that department. It's okay, but in all honesty not exactly the best I've ever had. But everything else in the relationship goes so well that the uninspiring sex seems like a price worth paying.

But a couple of months ago I did something really stupid - I read her diary. I know, I know, a terrible thing to do, and I take full responsibility for the wrongness of this action. Not only do I regret it because I broke her trust, but I also regret it for additional reasons that will soon be clear. There were a couple of things she did which were out of character and made me feel a bit weird/suspicious, and she left it lying right there on the sofa. Not my finest hour.

But I looked. And there was an entry about sex. To start off with, she's writing about how she finds our sex life boring and a couple of mildly disparaging comments about my sexual performance. Well, that hurt to read, but in all honesty I kinda feel the same way about her, so how can I be that upset? But she also followed it by saying how much she loves me and how amazing our relationship is, so she's happy to deal with this because 'no relationship is perfect'.

But what came next really upset me. There was also some stuff about a coworker who she has developed an infatuation for. She wrote that seeing him makes her 'weak at the knees', that he makes her unbelievably horny, and that she looks for excuses to talk to him at work etc. There was no evidence of any cheating, or intention to cheat. But she did write some very detailed sexual fantasies of what she would like to do with him. And said that she thinks about him when masturbating.

She also wrote plenty of other stuff about how much she loves me, values our relationship, etc etc. So that's all nice I guess.

But I feel absolutely sick and humiliated. Why can't I make her weak at the knees? And now every time she leaves for work I find myself wondering if she's talking to him, fantasising about him...

At the same time, she's done nothing wrong. I would be a hypocrite to get too upset about this--I watch porn. I fantasise about other women (although never really anyone I know personally) and masturbate to the thought of them. So I'm just as guilty of this as she is. On the other hand, I've never had this kind of crush on a particular person since I've been with her. That's part of what really upsets me - it's not like she's just thirsting after some random celebrity, this is a focused attraction to a particular person in her life.

I fucked up badly by reading the diary, and I never read it again after that one time. I need help - in the longer term to get over the insecurities that led me to read it - but also in the shorter term to get over the things that I read. It's affected how I see her and think about her, I feel so humiliated and upset sometimes and honestly just kinda sick.

How can I contextualize and compartmentalize these feelings, so that I can get over what I read? It's been a couple of months and I'm not sure it's getting any better. How can I get over this?

Grateful for anyone's thoughts and advice.

TLDR: read girlfriend's diary, she's madly infatuated with a coworker, I can't get over it.","herkese merhaba, evet başlıkta da yazdığı gibi kız arkadaşımla üç yıldan uzun süredir çıkıyorum, birçok yönden inanılmaz bir ilişkimiz var, birbirimizi seviyoruz ve destekliyoruz, bana karşı nazik, güzel, komik ve anlaşması kolay, nadiren kavga ediyoruz

ilişkideki tek soru işareti seks, dürüst olacağım, bu konuda hiçbir zaman tam olarak anlaşamadık, fena değil ama dürüst olmak gerekirse, sahip olduğum en iyi şey değil ama ilişkideki diğer her şey o kadar iyi gidiyor ki, ilham vermeyen seks, ödemeye değer bir bedel gibi görünüyor

ama birkaç ay önce gerçekten aptalca bir şey yaptım, günlüğünü okudum, korkunç bir şey yaptığımı biliyorum ve bu eylemin yanlışlığından tamamen sorumluyum, sadece güvenini kırdığım için pişman değilim, ayrıca yakında açıklanacak ek nedenlerden dolayı da pişmanım, karakterine uymayan ve beni biraz garip hissettiren birkaç şey yaptı, şüpheli ve onu orada kanepede bıraktı, en iyi zamanım değildi

ama baktım ve seksle ilgili bir giriş vardı, başlamak için, seks hayatımızı sıkıcı bulduğunu ve cinsel performansım hakkında birkaç hafif aşağılayıcı yorum okumak canımı acıttı ama dürüst olmak gerekirse ben de ona karşı aynı şekilde hissediyorum, nasıl bu kadar üzülebilirim ama o da bunu ne kadar çok sevdiğini ve ilişkimizin ne kadar harika olduğunu söyledi ve bununla başa çıkmaktan mutlu çünkü hiçbir ilişki mükemmel değildir

ama sonrasında olanlar beni gerçekten üzdü ayrıca aşık olduğu bir iş arkadaşıyla ilgili bazı şeyler de yazmıştı, onu gördüğünde dizlerinin bağının çözüldüğünü, inanılmaz derecede azgınlaştığını ve işte onunla konuşmak için bahaneler aradığını yazmıştı vs. aldatma veya aldatma niyetine dair hiçbir kanıt yoktu ama onunla ne yapmak istediğine dair çok detaylı cinsel fanteziler yazmıştı ve mastürbasyon yaparken onu düşündüğünü söylemişti

ayrıca beni ne kadar sevdiğine, ilişkimize ne kadar değer verdiğine dair bir sürü şey yazmıştı vs. vs. yani sanırım hepsi güzel

ama kendimi kesinlikle hasta ve aşağılanmış hissediyorum neden onu dizlerinin bağının çözüldüğünü söyleyemiyorum ve şimdi her işe gittiğinde acaba benimle konuşuyor mu diye merak ediyorum onun hakkında fanteziler kurması

aynı zamanda o hiçbir yanlış yapmadı bu konuda çok üzülmek ikiyüzlülük olurdu porno izliyorum başka kadınlar hakkında fanteziler kuruyorum ama şahsen tanıdığım hiç kimse hakkında değil ve onların düşüncesiyle mastürbasyon yapıyorum bu yüzden ben de onun kadar suçluyum diğer yandan onunla birlikte olduğumdan beri belirli bir kişiye karşı böyle bir ilgi duymadım beni gerçekten üzen şeyin bir parçası da bu sadece rastgele bir ünlüye susamış olması değil bu hayatındaki belirli bir kişiye odaklanmış bir çekim

günlüğü okuyarak fena halde hata yaptım ve ondan sonra bir daha hiç okumadım uzun vadede beni okumaya iten güvensizlikleri aşmak için yardıma ihtiyacım var ama aynı zamanda okuduğum şeyleri aşmak için kısa vadede de onu nasıl gördüğümü ve onun hakkında ne düşündüğümü etkiliyor bazen çok aşağılanmış ve üzgün hissediyorum ve dürüst olmak gerekirse sadece biraz hastayım

bu duyguları nasıl bağlamlandırıp bölümlere ayırabilirim ki okuduklarımın üstesinden gelebileyim birkaç ay oldu ve düzeldiğinden emin değilim nasıl üstesinden gelebilirim bu

herkesin düşünceleri ve tavsiyeleri için minnettarım

tldr kız arkadaşının günlüğünü oku bir iş arkadaşına deliler gibi aşık olmuş bunun üstesinden gelemiyorum"
"Me, my little sister and her boyfriend all rent an apartment together, with our rooms being directly next to each other's and connected by a closet that we keep locked. 
Their headboard is set directly in front of the closet door, so most times I can only hear faint moaning and the loud slamming of the headboard, but recently it's like she's forgotten just how paper thin the walls are.

It's highly uncomfortable to the point of tears for me, but I also feel like I'm being a baby about it. But I cannot sleep due to it and I'm unable to fall asleep for about an hour afterwards. Being sleep deprived isn't very safe for me bc I work heavy machinery during the day.
I've tried drowning out the noise, either watching a YouTube video loudly or listening to music, but most times I'm just woken by it. 

I've already spoke to her about this months back, when we had first moved in, and she reacted aggressively. I'm just very tired of it.

Edit: I'm reading all of the comments and some have really good advice, others are funny and are making feel better about the situation. 
I'll try and corner her later today after I get off work, hopefully it'll go better than it did the last time. Thank you!","ben, küçük kız kardeşim ve erkek arkadaşı hep birlikte bir daire kiralıyoruz, odalarımız yan yana ve kilitli tuttuğumuz bir dolapla birbirine bağlı

"I 23M am dating 20F (or so I thought). Me and my girlfriend met online through a minecraft server and  hit it off super well. I asked her to be my girlfriend after a couple months and we’ve been going steady for over a year now. I’ve never felt this way about a girl before, she is amazing in every way so caring and attentive. She’s really outgoing and we never stop laughing together. Since we are long distance things are limited as far as how much of her life I see. We FaceTime everyday and up until now I’ve never questioned anything she’s told me. I even bought a plane ticket to surprise her for her birthday next week. But today as I tried to contact her sister to set up surprise plans for flying out there she told me that my girlfriend has been lying to me about her age. She isn’t turning 21 but is turning 19. She said she kept telling her to confess to me but she wouldn’t and she felt bad for me since we were finally meeting. Of course, I am at a loss. I haven’t spoken to her yet but I find myself spiraling. What do I do? We had done “things” over the phone, sent pictures back then, now I don’t even know how to feel I mean could I get in trouble legally? That means we met when she was just 17. She would tell me about her college classes and even sent me pictures of her at the university. Our Minecraft server requires an ID picture to join and she’s verified. Her sister said she stole hers and used it to get in. I love this girl but I feel so weird about it all. She was underage when we met and she lied to me all this time. Advice?

"I (27f) was recently reached out to by a distant, but 1st cousin of mine (18f). She’s moving out of her house after graduation because of the living situation, but she reached out to me to ask what the “beef” was between her dad and I. 

Her dad molested me when I was 7 years old and when he was in his mid 20’s. He would show me porn videos, and tell me that “that’s what my parents were doing and one day you’ll do that”. He would drop me off in the middle of no where and make me scream things like “I’m a pretty princess” while doing jumping jacks when I was a dedicated “tomboy” at the top of my lungs for what felt like hours. I would lose my voice screaming it hoping he would hear me and he would drive back and pick me up. Eventually he’d pick me up and put me on the roof of his jeep and drive fast down dirt roads in the woods so I could “dry my tears” before we went home. 

On top of that experience, his brother that was a few years younger than him also molested/groomed me from the ages of 12-15 when he was 21-24. Definitely the most traumatic and lonely time of my life and I’m still navigating that trauma. 

I’ve come to a point in my life where it’s no longer hard for me to talk about. 

I’m stuck between whether I tell her like “yeah your dad and our uncle both molested me when I was a kid” or if I should just tell her about her dad or if I just like say nothing. Idk. I feel like everyone deserves to know that they are pedophiles and who knows what she’ll end up opening up to me about if I share my story with her. 

I truly want to tell her everything- but it’s just the struggle of whether or not I should. I’m an open book at this point in my life and I don’t mind sharing, but she’s 18 and I haven’t spoken to her since she was like 7 maybe.

 Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: I’m more concerned with the idea that whatever I tell her will greatly change her perception of everything she has ever known 

Update: hi friends, I appreciate each and every one of you so much. Thank you all so much for the insight and I am incredibly grateful for all of your advice and support. I will be telling her once I get back to my hometown to meet up with her in person (in a few days) I will definitely be giving her a disclosure and ensuring she has resources available outside of me. She deserves to know - I live across the country from her currently, and I’m going to ensure that I can be a safe person for her to come to and talk to, as well as making sure her safety and my safety isn’t at risk. I told my family about both uncles growing up and nothing ever happened, but I feel like this opportunity is presenting Itself now for a reason and telling her will do more good than harm.

güncelleme merhaba arkadaşlar her birinizi çok takdir ediyorum içgörüleriniz için hepinize çok teşekkür ederim ve tüm tavsiyeleriniz ve desteğiniz için inanılmaz derecede minnettarım memleketime dönüp buluştuğumuzda ona anlatacağım birkaç gün içinde onunla şahsen görüşeceğim, kesinlikle ona bir açıklama yapacağım ve benden başka kaynakları olduğundan emin olacağım, şu anda ülkenin diğer ucunda yaşadığımı bilmeyi hak ediyor ve onun gelip konuşabileceği güvenli bir kişi olabileceğimden ve onun ve benim güvenliğimin tehlikede olmadığından emin olacağım.

"Ever since I was 12 I knew my mom had been cheating on my dad. She actually sat my brother and I down to let us know that she was, and tried saying that her reasons for doing so were valid ones: he didn’t want to have sex, he was mean sometimes, silly stuff like that. No he was never abusive, he was just old and out of steam so he couldn’t always meet her intimate demands. For years she had boyfriends that she had no problem having my brother and I know about, but here’s where things got really bad. Around 2016 she brought a guy to the house who looked relatively young. I’d say maybe early 20’s. She introduced him as a cousin of ours and essentially moved him into our house. Well, I came across her secret Facebook account and found clear evidence that this so called cousin was just another boyfriend of hers, but this time she had the audacity to move him into our home. The home my father works and pays for to keep a roof over our heads. Well for the past year now my dad’s suspicions had been growing, he would see him sneak out of her room at night, go everywhere with her, do everything for her, he even caught them in her room ( yes, her room since my dad and my mom don’t share a room like most couples ) with her top off. Granted she was wasted and passed out, but you get the picture. Even then he refused to believe it. I tried to hint at my dad that he needs to get that guy out of his house asap, but with the economy being in shambles he would say that he needs the rent that he pays. Even so I kept trying I even spoke with my mom to try to convince her to do the right thing and get him out of here, she’s humiliating our entire family and making us look like a joke ( all of our outside family from my mom’s side knew ) and she had absolutely zero shame about it. Well, fast forward to last night I went to get drinks with my dad, we shot the shit as we always do but the subject of our little house guest came up again. I can’t say what gave me the courage to finally open up, but I told him the full truth. I was crying out of fear thinking my dad will hate me for keeping this from him for so long, but I told him everything. I told him about her telling me when I was 12, what I’ve known since then, and the worst part. Her little boyfriend living under his roof. I had to literally give him my car so that he can go to work every morning just so that he can stay living under this house, all because my mom practically made me since she obviously didn’t want to get rid of him. The anger kept building up and building up so I told my dad every little detail and begged him not to hate me. He didn’t. He said it was okay and the only one at fault here is her for putting that on a 12 year old. Then came the confrontation, we got home and there they were sitting together talking and he immediately rushed at him. He got in his face but didn’t get physical with him ( Thank God, my dad is a 6’3 veteran who could rip this dude apart if he wanted to ) and told them both they need to “get the fuck out of the house by tomorrow.” My mom despises me now so I’ve ruined my relationship with her. I woke up not too long ago wondering if this was the right move, I do love my mom but hate what she’s been doing to my dad. I don’t want my relationship with her to end but now it clearly has. I don’t know where to go from here and I feel like maybe I should have done things differently. Where should I go from here? Did I do things right?

Update: she’s currently letting everyone on her side of the family know that I have ruined her life. So there’s probably zero chance of her and I ever fixing things. Thanks to everyone who commented it means a lot to both my dad and I. 

Update 2: Some way, some how she managed to manipulate him yet again. Painting herself as the victim the whole time, and now she always sits around giving me smug looks as if to say “I won and you lost” as if this were ever about winning or losing. My brother’s birthday just came up and she had to move past my chair to get something and she decided to shove me pretty hard. I of course didn’t like it so I told her “say excuse me?” And her response was “I don’t have to fucking say excuse me to you 🫸🏻” lol. I opened my mouth because I thought I was saving him from her, but now I’m just in an even worse house than I was in before I opened my mouth. She’s even started doing witchcraft on me for safe measure. Now I’m sure plenty of you don’t believe in that and that’s fine, but those who do, please pray to Christ for me. I told him because he made it clear he’d leave her, otherwise I may not have said so but I wanted him free of her and now I’m the one in shackles. It’s clear there’s zero hope for this family so I’m clocking out and abandoning this post. Thanks for everyone’s advice it all helped a lot. But it was for nothing and now here I am. Take care everyone. ","Annem babamı aldattığını öğrendiğimden beri, aslında kardeşim ve beni oturtup bize bunu bildirmeye çalıştı ve bunu yapmasının geçerli sebepleri olduğunu söylemeye çalıştı, seks yapmak istemiyordu, bazen kötü davranıyordu, böyle aptalca şeyler oluyordu, hayır, asla tacizci değildi, sadece yaşlıydı ve buharı tükürüyordu, bu yüzden yıllarca annemin samimi taleplerini her zaman karşılayamıyordu, hiç sorun yaşamadığı erkek arkadaşları vardı, kardeşim ve ben biliyoruz ama işler burada gerçekten kötüye gitmeye başladı, eve nispeten genç görünen bir adam getirdi, sanırım s'nin başlarında, onu bizim kuzenimiz olarak tanıttı ve esasen onu bizim evimize taşıdı, gizli facebook hesabına rastladım ve bu sözde kuzenin sadece onun diğer erkek arkadaşlarından biri olduğuna dair açık kanıtlar buldum ama bu sefer onu bizim evimize taşıma cüretini gösterdi, babamın başımızın üzerinde bir çatı olması için çalıştığı ve parasını ödediği ev, geçen yıl babamın şüpheleri artmıştı, geceleri odasından gizlice çıktığını görüyordu, onunla her yere gidiyordu, onun için her şeyi yapıyordu, hatta onları odasında bile yakalıyordu, evet, o Babam ve annem çoğu çift gibi aynı odayı paylaşmadığı için annem üstü çıplaktı ve baygındı ama durumu anladınız, buna rağmen inanmayı reddetti, babama o adamı bir an önce evinden çıkarması gerektiğini ima etmeye çalıştım ama ekonominin perişan olması nedeniyle ödediği kirayı ödemek zorunda olduğunu söyledi, yine de denemeye devam ettim, hatta annemle konuşup doğru şeyi yapması ve onu buradan çıkarması için onu ikna etmeye çalıştım, tüm ailemizi küçük düşürüyor ve bizi bir şaka gibi gösteriyor, annemin tarafındaki tüm dış ailemiz bunu biliyordu ve bundan kesinlikle hiç utanmıyordu, dün geceye hızlıca ilerleyelim, babamla içki almaya gittik, her zaman yaptığımız gibi saçmaladık ama küçük ev misafirimiz konusu yine açıldı, sonunda açılma cesaretini neyin verdiğini söyleyemem ama ona tüm gerçeği söyledim, korkudan ağlıyordum, babamın bunu ondan uzun süre sakladığım için benden nefret edeceğini düşünüyordum ama ona her şeyi anlattım, bana küçükken söylediğini ve o zamandan beri bildiklerimi ve en kötü yanı, küçük erkek arkadaşının onun çatısı altında yaşadığını anlattım Ona her sabah işe gidebilmesi için arabamı vermek zorunda kaldım, sadece bu evin altında yaşamaya devam edebilmesi için, tüm bunlar annemin beni neredeyse zorlaması yüzündendi, çünkü ondan kurtulmak istemiyordu, öfke giderek artıyordu, bu yüzden babama her küçük ayrıntıyı anlattım ve benden nefret etmemesi için yalvardım, nefret etmedi, tamam dedi ve buradaki tek suçlunun bir yaşındaki bir çocuğa bunu yapması olduğunu söyledi, sonra yüzleşme başladı, eve geldik ve orada birlikte oturmuş konuşuyorlardı ve hemen ona saldırdı, yüzüne vurdu ama ona fiziksel müdahalede bulunmadı, tanrıya şükür babam isterse bu adamı parçalayabilecek bir gaziydi ve ikisine de yarına kadar evden siktirip gitmeleri gerektiğini söyledi, annem artık benden nefret ediyor, bu yüzden onunla olan ilişkimi mahvettim, çok uzun zaman önce uyanıp bunun doğru hareket olup olmadığını merak ettim, annemi seviyorum ama babama yaptıklarından nefret ediyorum, onunla olan ilişkimin bitmesini istemiyorum ama şimdi açıkça bitti, bundan sonra nereye gideceğimi bilmiyorum ve belki de bazı şeyleri farklı yapmam gerektiğini hissediyorum, nereye gitmeliyim? buradan itibaren doğru şeyleri yaptım mı

Honesty it's true that I'm crappy in bed because he is my first partner so I don't really know what I'm doing but he thinks I should be good by now and know what to do from watching porn and tutorials unfortunately I'm not really getting it. I learn by doing and this upsets him. He says I'm not trying and says I'm bad in bed all the time. He says I don't have common sense. I don't feel I'm being too annoying by asking him to guide me but I feel like absolute shit. ,"Dürüst olmak gerekirse yatakta berbat olduğum doğru çünkü o benim ilk partnerim bu yüzden ne yaptığımı gerçekten bilmiyorum ama o artık iyi olmam gerektiğini ve porno ve eğitim videoları izleyerek ne yapmam gerektiğini bilmem gerektiğini düşünüyor ne yazık ki ben gerçekten anlamıyorum, yaparak öğreniyorum ve bu onu üzüyor, denemediğimi ve yatakta her zaman kötü olduğumu söylüyor, sağduyumun olmadığını söylüyor, bana rehberlik etmesini isteyerek çok sinir bozucu olduğumu düşünmüyorum ama kendimi tam bir bok gibi hissediyorum"
"Hi, I hate showering. I shower every day for about 10 mins and I wash my hair about 2-4 times a week. But I just can’t stand it even though I do it. Getting undressed, going in the shower, washing my body, sometimes washing my hair, drying, putting on my clothes, etc., it’s so draining every single day. Especially with the post-shower routine of moisturizing, hair care etc.? I tried putting on some of my fave music, switching up the lighting, etc. but none of it had helped so far. Any advice? 

UPDATE: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone for your advice and kind words! Although all my responses have been pretty similar, I promise I am reading everyone’s comments and plan on following all the advice. So thank you everyone very much! (ALSO I have been doing my best to respond to everyone, if I have not replied to you yet I’m sorry! 😭🫶🏻)

UPDATE 2: Thank you again everyone! I have been reading everyone’s replies :) Unfortunately I’m a bit overwhelmed right now with responding to everyone but just know that I really appreciate all the help and advice from you guys 😊💕 ","merhaba duş almaktan nefret ediyorum her gün yaklaşık dakika duş alıyorum ve haftada bir kez saçımı yıkıyorum ama buna dayanamıyorum soyunsam da duşa girsem de bazen vücudumu yıkasam da saçımı kurutsam da kıyafetlerimi giysem de her gün çok yorucu oluyor özellikle duş sonrası nemlendirme saç bakımı rutini vs. en sevdiğim müziklerden bazılarını açmayı denedim ışığı değiştirmeyi vs. ama hiçbiri işe yaramadı şimdiye kadar herhangi bir tavsiyeniz var mı

"My cat ate a small, yet obstructive, object. I took her into the vet for puking and they found it lodged in her intestine via x-ray.

The quote? Somewhere around $6500 to extract it via surgery.

They are giving her fluids atm in the hopes it’ll pass and surgery can be avoided, but they said it’s unlikely.

This seems like such a ridiculous amount of money. I have a 6 month old baby, I’m on mat leave, and we’re having home Reno’s done right now. Honestly can’t afford this realistically. 

This is more of a vent than anything. UGH. What to do. I really don’t want to have her euthanized or anything like that, she’s young and healthy.

JUST signed up for pet insurance right when I got home from the vet. Had a similar incident last year and although not nearly as costly, I can’t go through this again

ETA: vet just called. Miraculously, the object has moved and she likely won’t need the surgery. 

ETA2: she’s home! No surgery required, *only* ended up costing us $1200 for the fluid treatment. Thank god.","kedim küçük ama tıkayıcı bir cisim yedi, kusması için veterinere götürdüm ve röntgende bağırsağında sıkışmış olduğunu buldular

I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable.

Married more than 20 years. On balance, it’s been a really, really good marriage - we complement each other well. Yet our sex life was fairly so-so. I (F55) never felt very horny or turned on - but wouldn’t say it was his (M56) fault. I could never really come. Sort of a light orgasm, if I did come - like 1 out of 25 times. I just didn’t have it figured out. But I always made sure to have sex with him 1-2+ times a week over the years. 

Life changed recently:

1. I went on hormone therapy a few years ago and it gave me a libido. I discovered I wanted a lot of sex! Great!  

2. I can hardcore orgasm now! Figured it out! He was originally anti toy for me. His ego was in the way — he said HE should be able to make me come, not the toy. So we never really had toys, but we recently serendipitously got a certain brand of clit sucker after I got served up an ad on insta. Who knew — but it puts me on the moon. I can come many, many times - loud, feral, crazy and trembling. Which makes me want him even more. He has tried to put ego aside. It bothered him/ probably still bothers him. 

3. Regardless, we were enjoying this new lease on life — sex 4+ nights a week — and exploring each other more for about 18 months and then husband got prostate cancer. It’s a bitch. Grateful that he is cancer-free, but it has affected his performance and physical abilities — at least while he heals. Could be 2 years until we really know how much he’ll regain his function. 

Really proud of his positivity and mental hardiness. It’s hard on him. It’s also affected his bladder - he wears pads, etc. So I am trying to be extra sensitive and make sure he feels great. 

Here’s the brewing issue… my ass. I never masturbated by myself in the past. But I do a little now that I discovered my ability to orgasm like a rock star. When I play with myself - I tease/lightly rub my asshole and the sensation is great for me while I come. 

He has always wanted to get back there. He’s tried playing with my asshole in past — he’s really into it but frankly he either has a poor technique or I’m not into it with him. I will say go slower and “not so much” or “not so deep.” I get really embarrassed instructing, but it burns and hurts and I’m not sure he gets it anyway. I feel like saying “ouch” or “don’t do that” — bc he’s basically stuffing a turkey or something, but I keep it pretty high-level with the “go slower, not so much” commentary. I’m fairly polite. 

The night before his prostate removal surgery — he “surprised” me by switching from vagina to ass in the heat of the moment. I let it continue bc it went quickly and I thought he may never be able to have sex again. Let him have his dream. It was okay, I suppose. 

He is now saying he can only get off with anal sex. Blow job is off the table bc there is a distinct (very bad, sick-smelling) odor post surgery (4 months post op- and could be awhile). I did not deliver our children so PIV should be tight- think PIV doesn’t do it for him like anal. 

I let him have anal yesterday (this was our second time ever) because I love him and, yeah, I feel sorry for him. Yes, I came. It was actually intense. My butt hurt all day and today. I have a very serious job that requires travel and etc. I don’t like having my ass hurt like that for two days. I told him thank you/I liked it and that I could probably get behind anal (pun intended) on special occasions bc it does hurt. 

I could even get excited about it. But all the sexy fun in me disappeared bc he is now pouting and controlling. 

He’s response to me saying hurt, it’s a special occasion and not every time… he said, “That’s like me saying, ‘your $300 vibrator is for special occasions only…’ So the rest of the time you will just get my hand three days a week…”

To which I politely said, “I’m just letting you know that while I think I can enjoy it with you - it can also hurt. It’s not a weekly thing — it’s a special occasion thing.”

His response, “Ok. Let me know when I can bring out the vibrator then.” (Meaning, no vibrator until he gets anal.)

This pisses me off. He knows I can’t come without the toy. Just when we figured me out. Has made me very tepid to the sharing an anal experience with him now. 

Not sure it matters but while I play the conciliatory wife role at home — yet I am a confident executive who earns a million dollars a year. He has not had the career I have had, and I’m always careful about the power dynamic. I don’t care about the money. I yield a lot to him in my personal life so he feels manly and in charge. He can be controlling about a lot of things — I’m always careful in our own house to yield bc I do things “wrong.” He calls himself semi-retired — works a few hours a week on “investments,” stays home all day, sits in the same chair all day (not exaggerating), under the guise of “taking care of me.” (He does the cooking and cleaning bc I don’t do it his way. We also have a maid, fyi.) 

I cover for him with friends and family and prop him up. We look like a power couple externally, but he is sometimes lacking external stimulation, a purpose outside of taking care of me, is getting overweight/out of shape. (Before the prostate issue.)

I work hard at making sure he feels great. I’ve seen the other side - he’s a controlling guy when insecure and threatened. Made my life miserable when I was accepted into an Ivy-league executive business program — he attempted to control my life as he was worried about male attention I might receive.

People would say I am top of my game outside of the house. I am fit/work out every day, am attractive, look like I’m 45 vs 55, have a huge career that’s super stressful but rewarding. My paycheck is our paycheck and pays for his expensive hobbies, world travel, he’s amassed probably 200k of his collectibles/“things” (watches, guns, car). My hobby is work (bc I love it).  

How mad or hurt am I allowed to be that he is pouting and threatening to take away my toy/the way I can orgasm bc I don’t want anal sex every time? 

Do I give in to his request every time?

TLDR: husband can be controlling and demands anal after his prostate diagnosis; threatens to take away my “toys” (the only way I can come) unless he gets anal. He has a fragile ego and I try to make him feel important and not in my shadow, but I think this really pisses me off. What should I do - give in?","im not sure if im being unreasonable

"So basically I (28F) have this friend (30F) that I’ve been close with ever since high school. We were kind of separated for a while but I recently moved back to my hometown and reunited with her. She’s a single mom and has a heavy work load, so I’ve been helping her around the house and babysitting her two children (6M and 11M).

Now this is where the problem comes in. The 11 y/o won’t stop looking at me. I mean really staring. He tries to be discreet about it but I can always tell when it’s happening. He doesn’t follow me around or anything, but if I’m in the kitchen and he’s in the living room he’ll be non stop looking until I turn around then he quickly pretends to be watching something on his ipad or his Nintendo switch. The other day it got especially bad because well, I noticed something *else* going down there along with the staring. I really don’t know if he put something down his pants or what- but it was blatantly obvious. I nearly shrieked and I had to run quickly into the bathroom just to get away and try to calm down.

I have absolutely no idea about how to bring this up to my friend. She’s been so good to me since I moved back and I don’t want to seem like I’m accusing her son of anything. He has severe ADHD and is currently unmedicated for it (insurance issue, long story) so I feel like it’s difficult for him to control his impulses which just makes me feel guilty. But at the same time I can’t even focus when I’m over there now because I know the kid is just staring. What do I do ?","yani temelde liseden beri yakın olduğum bir arkadaşım var, bir süre ayrı kaldık ama yakın zamanda memleketime geri döndüm ve onunla yeniden bir araya geldik, bekar bir anne ve çok fazla işi var, bu yüzden ona ev işlerinde yardım ediyorum ve iki çocuğuna bakıyorum, m ve m

işte sorun burada başlıyor, bana bakmayı bırakmıyorsun, yani gerçekten dik dik bakıyor, bunu gizli tutmaya çalışıyor ama ne zaman olduğunu her zaman anlayabiliyorum, beni takip etmiyor ya da başka bir şey yapmıyor ama ben mutfaktaysam ve o oturma odasındaysa, arkamı dönene kadar durmadan bakıyor, sonra hemen ipad'inde ya da nintendo switch'inde bir şey izliyormuş gibi yapıyor, geçen gün özellikle kötü oldu çünkü bakışların yanında aşağıda başka bir şey daha olduğunu fark ettim, pantolonunun içine bir şey mi soktuğunu gerçekten bilmiyorum ama apaçık belliydi, neredeyse çığlık atacaktım ve hemen banyoya koşup uzaklaşmak ve sakinleşmeye çalışmak zorunda kaldım

"Throwaway because you could not waterboard this out of me.

I share a bathroom with my sister and my brother. I was ready to go to bed for the night so I go to the bathroom, do my stuff. I sat on the toilet and didn't notice anything at that point. But then I pulled my normally loose fitting shorts up and they kind of glued on to my ass. At that point I thought I had maybe spilled something oddly sticky on the inside of my shorts. I long to return to those blissfully ignorant moments. It was only as I was cleaning up and I bent over that I realized the sticky thing was on me, not my shorts. I bent over and I could feel it like crack if that makes any sense? 

All this to explain that for some reason it occurred to me to look at the toilet seat and sure enough........................... I found what I expected to find. I already cleaned the seat but maybe that was a mistake because I could have left it for my siblings to find and then maybe my sister would have noticed and told him about it. Or he would have noticed it when he sat down to use the toilet.

I know this is dramatic but this is honestly a little traumatizing so does anyone have any advice for how to mentally stop feeling so grossed out? And how do I communicate this with my brother in a way that doesn't make me want to dig a hole to the middle of earth and hide?","at gitsin çünkü bunu benden su işkencesiyle çıkaramazsın

Kız kardeşim ve erkek kardeşimle aynı banyoyu paylaşıyorum, gece yatmaya hazırdım, bu yüzden tuvalete gittim, işlerimi yaptım, tuvalete oturdum ve o noktada hiçbir şey fark etmedim ama sonra normalde bol olan şortumu yukarı çektim ve o noktada kıçıma yapıştılar, şortumun içine garip bir şekilde yapışkan bir şey döktüğümü düşündüm, o mutlu cahil anlara geri dönmek istiyorum, sadece temizlik yaparken eğildiğimde yapışkan şeyin şortumda değil bende olduğunu fark ettim, eğildim ve çatladığını hissedebildim, eğer bu mantıklıysa

Bütün bunlar, bir sebepten dolayı tuvalet oturağına bakmam gerektiğini ve beklediğim şeyi bulduğumu açıklamak içindi, oturağı zaten temizlemiştim ama belki de bu bir hataydı çünkü kardeşlerimin bulması için bırakabilirdim ve sonra belki kız kardeşim fark eder ve ona söylerdi veya tuvaleti kullanmak için oturduğunda fark ederdi

Bunu biliyorum dramatik ama dürüst olmak gerekirse biraz travmatik. Bu yüzden zihinsel olarak bu kadar iğrenmeyi nasıl durdurabileceğim ve bunu kardeşimle, dünyanın ortasına bir çukur kazıp saklanmak istemeden nasıl iletişim kurabileceğim konusunda herhangi bir tavsiyesi olan var mı?"
"When I met my boyfriend he was the most amazing person. He would go out of his way to do nice things and constantly tell me how much he adores me. Very thoughtful and consistent. All of my family and friends loved him. After 8 months of being together he kept bringing up moving in with me. I didn’t feel ready. He had been mentioning wanting to propose at a year but said we needed to live together first. So I let him move in. Afterwards, he never brought it up. If I brought it up or made a light joke he would say I was being pushy. 

After a 1-2 months of living together he starting picking at little things. He would say ‘I didn’t make a night special enough’ or ‘I didn’t tell him he looked nice’ or ‘I don’t go out enough’ or ‘I didn’t spend enough time with him’ He would get upset and bring up all these things he didn’t like about me all at once. Which was soo wild to me bc he was practically obsessed with me before. This started to happen about 1-2 times a month. There was always ways I could be better. I figured he was just communicating his needs. 

After 3 months he started to get weird or upset if I went out with a friend all or if I didn’t message him back within an hour. He was always messaging me. Even if I went out for brunch with friends for 2 hours he would text me asking how it was going. Then he started to tell me i wasn’t messaging him enough and he was the one putting in all the work in the relationship. He told me I was the least affectionate gf he’s had. So I worked on giving him more texts and validation 

It seemed like it was never enough. If I was upstairs watching tv for an hour I should’ve been downstairs watching a movie with him and his daughter. If he was home with his daughter I should be home with them and not with friends. He finally freaked out bc I went to a comedy show last minute with a friend when he was out of town and didn’t tell him before hand. I told him I felt like I was drowning and need my space. And then he would go to the basement by himself and act really sad and I would feel horribly guilty. I wasn’t comfortable in my house.

Everyone thinks he’s this amazing outgoing perfect guy. But being with him is slowly making me feel like I’m an awful person. I do care about him deeply. How do I figure out if he’s manipulating me or if there’s something wrong with me? I’m worried if I leave I’ll be throwing away something good or leaving a person that cares so much. Please help

"I’m a 28 year old female married to a man for 3 years. He just turned 29 and is so concerned about turning 30. He wants to be a dad and children desperately. Problem is, he has little to no sex drive. We used to fight about this so strongly that we almost divorced over it last year. At the lowest point, I almost cheated. I didn’t, coming clean to my husband and choosing to stay with him after he promised that things would change and improve. They have in many ways, but not in regards to our sex life.

I constantly ask him for sex and either get turned down or a promise to have sex later, which never ends up happening. On the rare chance I get lucky and we do have sex, it’s over as quickly as it started (if you get what I’m saying). Both of our self esteems are in the gutter; mine because I am constantly missing out on the emotional connection and affirmation, and his because he cannot provide and satisfy.

If you’re wondering, he’s tried testosterone injections, oral stimulant medication, antidepressants, ADHD testing (that he now is medicated for), a sleep study (with no concrete results). The science side of things has been covered, with no lasting change. His blood tests consistently result at the range of a 70 year old man.

So what do I do? I love this man very much and I really want a life and future children with him. But how can we do that without having sex? Why would I give up my body to carry a child for 9 months when our sex life now doesn’t even make it worth it?

Do I just stop asking him for sex and picking this fight now that we both know this will never change? Do I stay married to the man I love, but spend the rest of my life horny, frustrated, unsatisfied, and resentful? Do I start masturbating by myself, even though it’s against his wishes and would devastate his trust and self esteem if he found out? 

What do I do?","ben bir yaşında bir kadınım, yıllardır bir adamla evliyim, yeni döndü ve dönüşmek konusunda çok endişeli, baba olmak ve çocuk sahibi olmak istiyor, sorun şu ki cinsel isteği çok az veya hiç yok, bunun hakkında o kadar şiddetli kavga ederdik ki geçen yıl neredeyse boşanıyorduk, en düşük noktada neredeyse aldatıyordum, kocama itiraf etmedim ve her şeyin değişeceğine ve gelişeceğine söz verdikten sonra onunla kalmayı seçtim, birçok yönden değiştiler ama seks hayatımızla ilgili değil

sürekli ondan seks istiyorum ve ya reddediliyorum ya da daha sonra seks yapma sözü veriyorum ki bu asla gerçekleşmiyor, şanslıysam ve seks yaparsak başladığı kadar çabuk bitiyor, ne demek istediğimi anlıyorsan ikimizin de öz saygısı dibe vurmuş durumda, benimki duygusal bağlantıyı ve onayı sürekli kaçırdığım için, onunki ise sağlayamadığı ve tatmin edemediği için

"I am visiting a friend who recently moved to a city close ish to me for a week! We haven’t seen each other in a few years because of our living situations. She is married now and has a partner and they both work full time. I’m single income and working fulltime. They earn more than me. 

I thought we were close friends. I paid for my own plane ticket, I brought her and her husband presents and chocolate, and brought my own hygiene products. I’m staying in her house. We were both very excited.

She hasn’t cooked a single meal for me, she’ll cook for her and her husband and ask me what my plans are for myself. I have been going to get groceries and eating instant ramen… they’ve picked up the tab for me at two or three restaurants we’ve been to, and I’ve paid for myself all other times. 

I feel a bit weird about it… she’s in a small town with nothing to do (around 10k people). There aren’t any tourist places here. I came solely to be with her. If she lived in a city that I would otherwise visit, I would be fine paying her to stay! It was pretty clear I was only coming here to see her. This trip is looking like it’ll cost me $700+, which I’m starting to think I could’ve spend otherwise.

I can’t help but feel like I’m over reaching or think I’m closer to her than we actually are? I couldn’t make her wedding due to covid and sent her an item on her registry (~250$), because I thought she was one of my closest friends. But now, considering how she’s treating me, I’m wondering if I’m over attached to her.

I dunno. Any advice on how to handle or reconcile my emotions? 

Edit: one of the comments mentioned this, and I think I should point this out. I am pescatarian! Her and her husband eat everything, so she’s been only putting red meats into the food, though I know she loves seafood, and she does have quite a large selection of frozen seafood that she hasn’t touched since I got here

Edit: someone mentioned i should say in my post that I’ve been getting groceries and she’s been using them too. I’ve also picked up the tab a couple of times when we’ve gone out too. And there are two of them, so I pay proportionally more. Also there are many comments asking why I haven’t spoken to her about it. I guess this was all just building up, and yesterday I felt really sad so I couldn’t sleep and posted this. I’m still debating whether I should talk to her because I’m leaving soon, and I am rethinking how close we actually are as friends, and if it’s worth it. 

Edit: one of my comments is attracting a lot of negative attention where I mentioned splitting air fare. My reasoning is that I expected some sort of reciprocity for my actions, whether it be financial or some sort of “warmth”, like offering me food or something! I didn’t ‘expect’ her to pay for my ticket. I did expected to pay for all my meals out, and I expected to cover some of my costs staying with her myself, it just feels weird since she’s being very cold with the food thing, since she invited me here. 

(Made a typo here. I want to say I DIDN’T expect her to pay for my tickets or meals out or anything, but I DID expect some level of hospitality. This could look like offsetting my costs -which is why I mentioned splitting airfare, again, this is an example, not an expectation -  or just letting me have food she already had in her fridge, anything. For example, I bought my own loaf of bread, because she said I should, but she had multiple loafs at home, so even that would’ve made a difference to me, and wouldn’t have felt so exclusionary) 


Edit: thanks everyone for your input!! There seems to be a lot of mix opinions. I’ve turned off the notifications for now. I’m going to take some time and leave the situation and think about how to approach it with my friend. I realized that I did set expectations on her, expected a certain level of reciprocity and hospitality from her. Some people are saying I suck, some people are saying I’m fine. Either way, this is a lot of comments, and I’ll be offline sorting out my next moves! 

For everyone reading, there are a lot more details in my comments, so feel free to hunt those down if you can for a more complete picture 

Update: I’m back home, and situation is mostly settled! I ended up inviting them to brunch before I left. I told them I felt very left out at  meal times, and the friendship felt a bit uneven. I mentioned in one of my comments that she had quite a few things in her house I’d sent her over the years, but I realized I didn’t have the same from her, which led to me feeling further isolated (and spiralling, so I wrote this post). I told her I felt excluded and a lot of her words and actions made me feel like my friendship needs weren’t being met. I told her I was fine paying and cooking for my own food, but I would’ve loved it if she was more engaging with me during meal times. Eg, cooking together, waiting for me to eat together, making sure I could access the grocery store etc. (I think I hyperfocussed on the cost of the trip in my og post because I was spiraling and cost is easy to quantify).

She apologized, and even teared up a little. Her husband looked a bit guilty as well. 

I think we just have each other on different priority lists! Nothing wrong with that. I picked up the tab for brunch to show her and her husband I had no ill intent towards them, and it wasn’t about the money. I wanted her to know that I am still her friend, but I was incredibly hurt by this trip! Don’t know what will happen now, but at least I communicated my feelings! 

Thanks for the input everyone!

"For context I have the master bathroom with an ensuite including a separate shower and deep oval tub. My roommate has a bath/shower combo and the tub is not as deep/wide as mine. I can see why she wants to use my bath, but I pay extra to have the master and I don’t want to share my bath with her because of her hygiene. She used it once without asking me right when I moved in, and left all her products around and little leg hairs all over the tub. I was pretty grossed out and frustrated since on top of moving in I had to clean up after her, but I didn’t say anything I just put her products back in her bathroom. I put a lock on my door so she can’t use it when I’m gone. She does not clean her own bathroom, we have a cleaning lady that comes once a month and she doesn’t do anything in between. I clean my bathtub after every bath and do a full bathroom clean in between cleaning lady visits. She also smells like BO sometimes, and her general hygiene/cleanliness is not up to my standards. Lately with the cold weather she has been asking me to use my bath and I’ve been making up excuses but I need to find a way to tell her nicely that I’m not sharing and to stop asking. If she wants to take a bath, she can clean her own bathtub and use that. I know hygiene is a sensitive subject so I need advice on how to approach this lightly.

"My current bf sucks on my nipples every time we’re hooking up and he really thinks i like it, spoiler alert i most definitely do not. It doesn’t feel good at all for me and honestly kind of hurts and feels uncomfortable most of the time.

"Update: Apartment hunting has begun. Dee has moved back home. Significantly longer commute time, but free rent for the short term and little other mental overhead. 

Reviewing contracts now to see what we can get back. With May wedding, not very optimistic outside of legal means. Even that has a cost-benefit. Told the bridesmaids to kindly give receipt copies for dresses/accessories. I wish there were a wedding *unplanner* professional as I'd throw money at them right now. Guests, venues...  &gt;Bleep&lt; me. 

She and Tom are on... hiatus...? Wedding &amp; engagement off, but they're not broken up entirely - appears amenicable. It appears, rightfully, in a ""WTF just happened"" zone. I found out they were looking to have a house built. Planning stages/talking to builders, so don't know how far in or if funds were put down. I figured she'll mention it when ready.

Dee said Tom demanded Mandy get psychological help, she responded with a ""sudden emergency"" visit her Mom in the east/New England somewhere. (No idea of Ron, Tom's Dad, packed her or the details.) I have asked Dee previously, and asked again the other day, how Mandy treated her. She said quite well, although she got the vibe that Mandy was trying to be a substitute for me. Things like, ""All I had is boys, now I'll have a daughter."" Things that could either be sweet or cringe. She asked about Sally and my son, who she knew and seemed pleased they were doing well. When I was mentioned Mandy would either be silent or say something eye-roll worthy, nothing notably vicious.

Apparently during the ensuing ""discussion"" Tom had with Mandy over what was going through her mind, her position was the dispute was between her and me. She stated that Dee still got a bridal shower and that I could host another smaller one for our family. She didn't quite realize the cost for the event (over $2k) and certainly did not quite comprehend the larger cost - emotional damage to Sally and my Mom. Tom astutely brought up that he has to question how any kids he and Dee would have be used as her pawns and how far she'd go over our dispute, even hurting them. 

Are there professionals (maybe these are therapists or some sort of coach) who help folks build boundaries and protections against relatives like Mandy? 

Well, off to bed. 

Original Post:
Finally stopped shaking enough to post - at 2 am as I have not slept since this happened.

My (55F) daughter, I'll call Dee, (27F) is engaged to a nice young man (Tom-27M). I get along with him and his siblings and father (54M) fine. His mother, I'll call Mandy, (54F) and I, on the other hand, have a bit of a history. We used to be good friends, but she sabotaged a project I was working on in a club we belonged to. (Too hard to explain, so suffice the explanation to this.) She and I have not spoken since when I left said club after and cut contact 7 years ago. 

I wanted to throw  bridal shower and sucked up my pride and offered an olive branch to Mandy to see if she and her friends/relatives would like to come. Our talk was surprisingly cordial and she even suggested we make it a surprise one. I'd handle the venue and she volunteered to handle the invites &amp; cake while reaching out to Dee's best friends to arrange to get Dee out and then ""happen to go to"" the restaurant where we were having the shower.

Pleasantly surprised and welcoming the help as I'm so busy as I have a start up business, we exchanged a few emails including discussing the date, time location. I supplied her with a list and told her I already told 2 of my best friends and of course my other daughter, Sally (25F), who'd be decorating. (Sally is Intellectually Disabled and was looking forward to contributing to her big sister's party.)

Fast forward to the party day (last weekend). We arrive to the venue early to decorate and set up. Catering was for 30 people, so it was a good size. Sally went all out with a helium tank &amp; balloons, streamers, etc. My husband (56M) and son (19M) fetched my mom from her skilled nursing facility. Although in hospice, he can do outings of a few hours and was looking forward to the shower as it's uncertain if she can attend the wedding - physically unable or unalive.

The plan was for folks to be there by 12:30 with my daughter and her two friends bringing her in about 12:45ish. Now, keep in mind future MIL was handling the invites &amp; logistics (plus bringing a cake). My two friends and hubby &amp; son with my Mom arrive. We expect Mandy (who has the cake) and the others to arrive soon.

12:45 I check my phone. Text from Dee's BFF (Bridget 26F) at 11:30 am: ""You're not coming????""

Wut? So I call. No answer but a text, ""Call you in a second."" A minute later she calls and is upset me, Sally &amp; my Mom are not there.

""The shower starts at 12:45 and..."" I filled her in on the plan, including that we're at the restaurant now. Bridget was silent for a moment then she let out a huge sigh... ""Holy #&amp;@*$... Mandy told us it was 11 am at her place. Surprise shower, so Kelly and I took Dee out for coffee and we had Tom call to say to meet him at his parent's place. Once we saw you and Sally were not there, Dee asked and Mandy said that 'Sadly your Mom could not get over old wounds.' Where are you now? ""

So I told her, and said don't worry about it. We'll be cleaning up and packing soon.

I then had the restaurant package up the food, I paid the tab plus gratuity, and my friends and I cleaned up while Sally sat crying and my husband and son packed up the gifts and took my Mom, also crying, back to her skilled nursing facility. I was so emotionally overwhelmed that I was numb. 

As my friends, Sally, and I were heading out with the food and reusable decorations, Bridget, Dee, Kelly and Tom pull in. I was too upset to talk so my friend, Phyllis (53F) filled them in as I was packing the car with food.

I go to Dee and told her that I had reached out to Mandy and how we split duties. Dee just stood in the parking lot for a minute, silent. She turns to Tom and says, ""You mother will make our marriage miserable. I'm sorry."" Takes off her engagement ring and hands it to him. 

Too emotionally drained to react, I motion to the car and drive her back to my house where she's been staying since as she shared an apartment with Tom. 

Now what should I do. Tom's a nice fellow and I could tell he was enraged. Tom's father has reached out to my husband and is floored his wife did such as things. No idea what to advise as I myself am so emotionally flenced I can't process. 

","update apartment hunting has begun dee has moved back home significantly longer commute time but free rent for the short term and little other mental overhead 

reviewing contracts now to see what we can get back with may wedding not very optimistic outside of legal means even that has a costbenefit told the bridesmaids to kindly give receipt copies for dressesaccessories i wish there were a wedding unplanner professional as id throw money at them right now guests venues  gtbleeplt me 

she and tom are on hiatus wedding amp engagement off but theyre not broken up entirely  appears amenicable it appears rightfully in a wtf just happened zone i found out they were looking to have a house built planning stagestalking to builders so dont know how far in or if funds were put down i figured shell mention it when ready

dee said tom demanded mandy get psychological help she responded with a sudden emergency visit her mom in the eastnew england somewhere no idea of ron toms dad packed her or the details i have asked dee previously and asked again the other day how mandy treated her she said quite well although she got the vibe that mandy was trying to be a substitute for me things like all i had is boys now ill have a daughter things that could either be sweet or cringe she asked about sally and my son who she knew and seemed pleased they were doing well when i was mentioned mandy would either be silent or say something eyeroll worthy nothing notably vicious

well off to bed

so i toldona ve endişelenme yakında temizlik yapıp paketleme yapacağız dedi

sonra restorana yemeği paketlettim hesabı ve bahşişi ödedim ve arkadaşlarımla ben temizlik yaparken sally ağlıyordu ve kocam ve oğlum hediyeleri paketledi ve annem de ağlıyordu ve annemi özel bakım tesisine geri götürdüler o kadar duygusal olarak bunalmıştım ki uyuşmuştum

arkadaşlarım sally ve ben yiyecek ve yeniden kullanılabilir süslemelerle dışarı çıkıyorduk bridget dee kelly ve tom içeri girdi ben konuşamayacak kadar üzgündüm bu yüzden arkadaşım phyllis f arabayı yiyecekle doldururken onları bilgilendirdi

dee'ye gittim ve ona mandy ile iletişime geçtiğimi ve görevleri nasıl bölüştüğümüzü söyledim dee bir dakika boyunca sessizce park yerinde durdu tom'a döndü ve dedi ki annen evliliğimizi mahvedecek özür dilerim nişan yüzüğünü çıkarıp ona uzattı

tepki veremeyecek kadar duygusal olarak tükenmiştim arabaya işaret ettim ve onu tom ile aynı daireyi paylaştığı için kaldığı evime geri götürdüm

şimdi ne yapmalıyım Toms'a iyi davranın ve öfkelendiğini söyleyebilirim Toms'un babası kocama ulaştı ve karısının böyle şeyler yapmasından dolayı şok oldu Ne tavsiye edeceğimi bilmiyorum çünkü ben de çok duygusalım ve işleyemiyorum"
"I don't orgasm when I have sex with my boyfriend. Maybe that's why I want to have sex all the time. I want to do it three times a day, but my boyfriend only wants to do it twice a week. What do you think we should do to fix that?",erkek arkadaşımla seks yaptığımda orgazm olmuyorum belki de bu yüzden her zaman seks yapmak istiyorum bunu günde üç kez yapmak istiyorum ama erkek arkadaşım haftada sadece iki kez yapmak istiyor bunu düzeltmek için ne yapmalıyız sence
"I [25F] do not want to be with my [29M] boyfriend anymore at all because he has been cheating on me off and on since we have gotten together 3 years ago and I do not want to give my energy to someone that would do that to me.

He constantly denies it and says that it’s all in my head. When I have tried to leave him in person (we are long distance) he makes it extremely difficult by begging me, crying and creating a big scene until I change my mind. When I have tried to leave over the phone he harasses me by sending me flowers to my house, and constantly emailing me after I block his number. 

I do not want to be with him but I feel trapped and do not know how to leave. It is his 30th birthday next week and he keeps pressuring me to not let him be alone on his birthday because he doesn't have any friends. 

I have panic attacks daily because I feel very emotionally manipulated by him and have done for 3 years. I just want to be free.

I don't know how to do it.","erkek arkadaşımla artık hiç birlikte olmak istemiyorum çünkü yıllar önce birlikte olduğumuzdan beri beni ara ara aldatıyor ve enerjimi bana bunu yapacak birine vermek istemiyorum

sürekli inkar ediyor ve her şeyin kafamda olduğunu söylüyor, onu şahsen terk etmeye çalıştığımda uzun mesafeliyiz, bana yalvararak ağlayarak ve fikrimi değiştirene kadar büyük bir sahne yaratarak bunu son derece zorlaştırıyor, telefonla ayrılmaya çalıştığımda bana evime çiçek göndererek ve numarasını engelledikten sonra sürekli e-posta göndererek beni taciz ediyor

onunla olmak istemiyorum ama kendimi sıkışmış hissediyorum ve nasıl ayrılacağımı bilmiyorum, gelecek hafta onun 3. doğum günü ve hiç arkadaşı olmadığı için doğum gününde onu yalnız bırakmamam için bana baskı yapmaya devam ediyor

yıllardır duygusal olarak manipüle edildiğini hissettiğim için her gün panik atak geçiriyorum, sadece özgür olmak istiyorum

nasıl yapacağımı bilmiyorum"
"Last night we had a family dinner and we kinda all sneaked in a few drinks and had some. So it was the 5 of us and everyone started to get a bit tipsy. We were all lying in bed and talking about random stuff and at one point my two cousins started to hug each other (like cuddle). It felt weird at first but I thought they were just being comfortable with each other. 

After a few mins when I looked at them they were making out ON THE BED IN FRONT OF ALL OF US. We all didn’t know what to do so we came out of the room and started freaking out. We split from there and went home. I just don’t know what to do anymore, I feel really disgusted and confused. ","dün gece aile yemeği yedik ve hepimiz gizlice birkaç içki içtik, bu yüzden hepimiz sarhoş olduk ve herkes biraz sarhoş olmaya başladı hepimiz yatakta yatıyorduk ve rastgele şeyler hakkında konuşuyorduk ve bir noktada iki kuzenim birbirlerine sarılmaya başladı, ilk başta garip geldi ama sadece birbirleriyle rahat olduklarını düşündüm

birkaç dakika sonra onlara baktığımda hepimizin önünde yatakta öpüşüyorlardı, hepimiz ne yapacağımızı bilmiyorduk, bu yüzden odadan çıktık ve çıldırmaya başladık, oradan ayrıldık ve eve gittik, artık ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, gerçekten iğrenmiş ve kafam karışık hissediyorum"
"A couple of days ago I ran away from my home to live in a cabin that I inherited from my best friend, who died two years ago. Nobody except for her parents knew that she had that cabin and that she had given it to me.

I didn't tell anyone where I was going, took some days off and told my boss I was going to work from home from now on. I also left letters to my fiancé, parents, cousins and closest friends explaining them that I was going to left their lives because I wanted to live with as few human interaction as possible.

Somehow my parents found me. I guess my friend's parents betrayed my trust and told them about the cabin. They arrived here this morning and they were furious and worried. They thought I was dead or in bad shape, but I'm clearly note. They said my motives and goals are unreallistic and that I should come back with them, fix things and get help because nobody can live in complete solitude.

The thing is...I think I can. I feel quite good since I'm here. I don't feel ugly or like I'm not enough. Yes, I miss my loved ones but I think I can manage it. Should I stay or come back with my parents?","birkaç gün önce iki yıl önce ölen en iyi arkadaşımdan miras kalan bir kulübede yaşamak için evimden kaçtım, ailesi dışında kimse onun bu kulübeye sahip olduğunu ve bana verdiğini bilmiyordu

nereye gittiğimi kimseye söylemedim, birkaç gün izin aldım ve patronuma bundan sonra evden çalışacağımı söyledim, ayrıca nişanlıma, anneme, kuzenlerime ve en yakın arkadaşlarıma, hayatlarını terk edeceğimi açıklayan mektuplar bıraktım çünkü mümkün olduğunca az insan etkileşimiyle yaşamak istiyordum

bir şekilde ailem beni buldu, sanırım arkadaşlarımın aileleri güvenimi sarstı ve onlara kulübeden bahsettiler, bu sabah buraya geldiklerinde öfkeliydiler ve endişeliydiler, öldüğümü veya kötü durumda olduğumu düşünüyorlardı ama açıkça motivasyonlarımın ve hedeflerimin gerçekçi olmadığını ve onlarla geri dönmem gerektiğini, işleri düzeltmem ve yardım almam gerektiğini çünkü kimsenin tamamen yalnız yaşayamayacağını söylediler

I (22F) was in a relationship with my boyfriend (M22) for over a year. We live in Canada. He’s from a country in the middle east and he recently went back to visit for a couple weeks. I found out when we got back that he had cheated on me more than once with a girl I had been told was 17. I had gone through his phone to record the evidence and found nude photos of the girl. It’s been a few days since I found out and I have recently been informed that the girl is actually 15 years old. I am waiting for more evidence that proves she actually is 15 because he has been going around saying she’s about to turn 18 (like that makes it better) and I know for a fact he is aware of her actual age (His friend from back home who introduced them told me her age and that my ex bf knew it) but I do not have solid concrete proof of that. Because she’s in a different country I don’t know the legalities of the situation but we do have a lot of mutual friends and I am planning on tell them but I’m unsure what to do/how to tell them. What should I do?,"Erkek arkadaşımla bir yıldan fazla bir süredir ilişkimiz vardı, Kanada'da yaşıyoruz. Orta Doğu'daki bir ülkeden ve yakın zamanda birkaç haftalığına ziyarete gitti. Geri döndüğümüzde beni bir kızla birden fazla kez aldattığını öğrendim. Bana söylenene göre telefonunu karıştırıp kanıtları kaydettim ve kızın çıplak fotoğraflarını buldum. Bunu öğrendiğimden beri birkaç gün geçti ve yakın zamanda kızın aslında yaşında olduğunu öğrendim. Gerçekten olduğunu kanıtlayacak daha fazla kanıt bekliyorum çünkü etrafta dolaşıp kızın böyle olacağını söylüyordu. Daha iyi oluyor ve kızın gerçek yaşını bildiğini biliyorum. Onları tanıştıran memleketindeki arkadaşı bana kızın yaşını söyledi ve eski erkek arkadaşım da bunu biliyordu ama farklı bir ülkede olduğu için bunun kesin ve somut bir kanıtım yok. Durumun yasallığını bilmiyorum ama çok sayıda ortak arkadaşımız var ve onlara söylemeyi planlıyorum ama ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, onlara nasıl söyleyeceğimi bilmiyorum, ne yapmalıyım?"
"Here’s list of all the good things and bad things about our relationship. Does the good outweigh the bad?

Good things: 
- he’s always there for me and gives me emotional supprt when i’m upset 
- we have a similar sense of humour and are always laughing together 
- he says good things about me to his friends and family
- he compliments me
- he always wants to spend time with me
- he buys me flowers and snacks sometimes 

Bad things:
- he gets upset and frustrated easily 
- he can be immature sometimes and doesn’t have good social manners (ex: farts and burps loudly in public)
- he has plenty of girl friends but says he doesn’t want me to have guy friends 
- he is frugal. We always go 50/50 on everything. (He has a full time job, is 26, lives at home, and pays 0 bills). And whenever its his birthday or a holiday, he asks me to buy him expensive gifts, knowing that i don’t have a lot of money. 
- one time during sex i told him it was hurting and that i wanted to stop but he wanted to keep going and said he’ll be more gentle and i agreed but then the condom broke and he made me pay for the plan b.
","İşte ilişkimizdeki tüm iyi ve kötü şeylerin listesi, iyi şeyler kötü şeylerden daha mı ağır basıyor

iyi şeyler
her zaman yanımda ve üzgün olduğumda bana duygusal destek veriyor
benzer bir mizah anlayışımız var ve her zaman birlikte gülüyoruz
arkadaşlarına ve ailesine benim hakkımda iyi şeyler söylüyor
bana iltifat ediyor
her zaman benimle vakit geçirmek istiyor
bazen bana çiçek ve atıştırmalıklar alıyor

kötü şeyler
kolayca üzülüyor ve hayal kırıklığına uğruyor
bazen olgunlaşmamış olabiliyor ve iyi sosyal tavırları yok, örneğin halk içinde yüksek sesle osurup geğiriyor
bir sürü kız arkadaşı var ama benim erkek arkadaşlarım olmasını istemediğini söylüyor
tutumlu biri her zaman her şeye dahil oluyoruz tam zamanlı bir işi var, evde yaşıyor ve faturaları ödüyor ve doğum günü veya tatil olduğunda çok param olmadığını bilerek bana pahalı hediyeler almamı istiyor
bir keresinde seks sırasında ona acı çektiğimi ve durmak istediğimi söyledim ama devam etmek istedi ve daha nazik olacağını söyledi ve ben de kabul ettim ama sonra prezervatif yırtıldı ve bana plan b'nin parasını ödetti"
"I (24F) have been married with my husband (25 M) for a year, we have a 4 month old baby together. I come from another country ( I’m European ) and I moved to North America to be with him, I have no friends, relatives or stuff in here but he does have his family and a lot of people that like him.. We’ve had our share of difficulties but nothing major until the Christmas Day. My husband wanted to go to his family’s house so his parents can see the baby.. We are Muslim so we don’t celebrate Christmas. His parents have 4 more children except him ( aged 14,11,8,5) and honestly I do not like to go there because my husband talks to his family in his native language (Arabic) and doesn’t try to speak to me, same for his parents - they’re nice tho.. I’m left with his little siblings that tire me out, they’re the type of children that never stop talking. On Christmas Day I didn’t wanted to go there and my baby was sleeping anyway at that time in my arms. He “jokingly” as he said slapped me when I said that I don’t want to go there and he tried to wake up the baby. I’ve started arguing with him that my baby’s sleep is more important than his family seeing her ( baby going through sleep regression and she’s barely sleeping ) and he said that if I don’t want to go he can go with my baby by himself. I have been with my baby by myself since she was born, I cosleep with her and she’s my only “friend”, he sleeps on the couch because he works.. I told him that he can’t take my baby because it’s MY baby, from there everything escalated and he hit me, multiple times. I have indeed hit him back but he’s triple my size and double my body weight. I’ve cried and cried by myself.. my baby was screaming because I was screaming.. that ended and I acted like nothing happened.. Today - 1 hour ago my husband turned off my internet, I went to the bathroom and in that time the baby woke up and we went downstairs, he started accusing me that I woke up the baby because I didn’t had internet anymore, I have said some bad words to him because how dare he accuse me of waking my own child up? I use the internet to watch videos and to not lose my mind while I try to put my baby to sleep.. it’s the only thing that keeps me sane honestly.. I have a colicky baby that is teething and going through a sleep regression.. He told me that I don’t do anything all day only stay on my phone.. I got mad at him and argued, he told me to take my daughter upstairs ( she fell asleep in her swing) and go. I said no and again he hit me. But this time I wanted to run, I went outside and he locked me out dor a minute, I was in shorts and no shoes or socks at 33 degrees - 0 in Europe crying in the middle of the night. He ended up opening the door, mocking me, then he went upstairs and checked my phone to see what I do or watch. He told me not to hit him back because I will lose my teeth He turned back on the internet while checking my phone I have a lot of bruises and a lot of tears, I honestly just want to die at this moment, I don’t know what to do or where to go.. I have no money no job and I have my baby I’m at 6,706 km from my home my life is terrible and I’m stupid for even moving here and it’s a shitty small town and it’s the middle of the winter

UPDATE : I have read your comments he‘s working today on his break he came and  he tried to talk to me today and act like nothing happened and brought me takeout and tried to touch me

Baby’s birth certificate is not out yet  Canada takes a long time after applying I have PR but my baby Has my husband‘s last name and Ive Read that I need something like a letter from him to travel with my baby abroad if that’s possible

i Don’t have much family back home and the ones that I have are not able to support me financially to get out of here we’re talking at least 2.5k for plane and even more to be able to go to the airport since it’s almost 3 hours away I’m in the middle of nowhere honestly in a small town where There’s a shelter but it’s only a night shelter for the homeless and you’re not able to stay during the day most homeless there are active users and there’s no rooms or anything just The divided beds

most people in this community that know him like his family and him and have had a bad opinion about our marriage thibkinf that Im coming to Canada to be able to become a citizen and I’m a fraud.. that’s what he said at least before we got married I know for sure that most people that I could potentially ask for help will be on his side or will try to solve the problem so the marriage lasts. once in our fights he said that he will give me the baby to take her back to mt home country I hope after the birth certificate arrives I will be able to Get her a passport

he works 12 to 8 from Monday to Saturday so I don’t see him much except on Sundays and on Monday since he’s off for new years

thanks for worrying about me I will keep updating you if theres no update know that  he probably turned off the internet again

&amp;#x200B;","Kocamla bir yıldır evliyim ve bir aylık bir bebeğimiz var. Başka bir ülkeden geliyorum, Avrupalıyım ve onunla birlikte olmak için Kuzey Amerika'ya taşındım. Burada arkadaşım, akrabam veya başka bir şey yok ama ailesi ve onu seven birçok insan var. Zorluklarımız oldu ama Noel gününe kadar büyük bir şey olmadı. Kocam ailesinin evine gitmek istedi, böylece ailesi bebeği görebilirdi. Müslümanız, bu yüzden Noel'i kutlamıyoruz. Ailesinin ondan başka çocukları var, yaşlı ve dürüst olmak gerekirse oraya gitmeyi sevmiyorum çünkü kocam ailesiyle ana dili Arapça konuşuyor ve benimle konuşmaya çalışmıyor. Ailesi için de aynı şey geçerli, onlar da iyi insanlar. Beni yoran küçük kardeşleriyle baş başa bırakıldım. Onlar Noel günü hiç susmayan türden çocuklar. Oraya gitmek istemedim ve bebeğim zaten uyuyordu. O sırada kollarımdaydı ve şaka yollu bana gitmek istemediğimi söylediğimde tokat attı. Bebeğimi uyandırmaya çalıştı. Onunla tartışmaya başladım, bebeğimin uykusunun ailesinin bebeğini görmesinden daha önemli olduğunu söyledi. uyku gerilemesi ve o zar zor uyuyor ve bana eğer gitmek istemiyorsam bebeğimle tek başına gidebileceğini söyledi, bebeğim doğduğundan beri tek başıma onunla birlikteyim, onunla birlikte uyuyorum ve o benim tek arkadaşım, kanepede uyuyor çünkü çalışıyor, ona bebeğimi alamayacağını çünkü benim bebeğim olduğunu söyledim, oradan her şey tırmandı ve bana defalarca vurdu, ben de ona karşılık verdim ama o benim üç katım ve vücut ağırlığımın iki katı, ağladım ve kendi kendime ağladım, bebeğim çığlık atıyordu çünkü ben çığlık atıyordum, bu sona erdi ve hiçbir şey olmamış gibi davrandım, bugün bir saat önce kocam internetimi kapattı, banyoya gittim ve o sırada bebek uyandı ve aşağı indik, bebeği uyandırdığımı suçlamaya başladı, çünkü artık internetim yoktu, ona birkaç kötü söz söyledim, nasıl cüret ederdi, beni kendi çocuğumu uyandırmakla suçlamaya, interneti video izlemek ve bebeğimi uyutmaya çalışırken aklımı kaçırmamak için kullanıyorum, beni aklımı başımda tutan tek şey bu, dürüst olmak gerekirse diş çıkaran kolik bir bebeğim var ve uyku regresyonundan geçiyorum bana bütün gün hiçbir şey yapmadığımı sadece telefonumda kaldığımı söyledi ona sinirlendim ve tartıştım bana kızımı yukarı çıkarmamı söyledi salıncakta uyuyakaldı ve gittim hayır dedim ve tekrar vurdu ama bu sefer koşmak istedim dışarı çıktım ve beni bir dakika dışarıda kilitledi şortlaydım ve ayakkabım veya çorabım yoktu avrupa'da dereceler gecenin bir yarısı ağlıyordu sonunda kapıyı açtı benimle alay etti sonra yukarı çıktı telefonumu kontrol etti ne yaptığımı veya izlediğimi görmek için bana karşılık vermememi söyledi çünkü dişlerimi kaybedeceğim telefonumu kontrol ederken internete geri döndü çok fazla morluğum ve çok fazla gözyaşım var dürüst olmak gerekirse şu anda sadece ölmek istiyorum ne yapacağımı veya nereye gideceğimi bilmiyorum param yok işim yok ve bebeğim var evimden kilometrelerce uzaktayım hayatım berbat ve buraya taşındığım için bile aptalım ve burası boktan küçük bir kasaba ve kışın ortasında

güncelleme yorumlarını okudum çalışıyor bugün tatilinde geldi ve benimle konuşmaya çalıştı ve hiçbir şey olmamış gibi davrandı ve bana paket servis getirdi ve bana dokunmaya çalıştı

bebeğimin doğum belgesi henüz çıkmadı kanada başvurudan sonra uzun zaman alıyor pr'im var ama bebeğimin soyadı kocamın ve bebeğimle yurtdışına seyahat etmek için ondan bir mektuba ihtiyacım olduğunu okudum eğer mümkünse

memleketimdeki pek fazla ailem yok ve olanlar da buradan çıkmam için beni maddi olarak destekleyemiyor en azından uçak için k ve hatta havaalanına gidebilmek için daha da fazla konuşuyoruz çünkü neredeyse saatlerce uzakta hiçbir yerin ortasındayım dürüst olmak gerekirse küçük bir kasabada bir barınak var ama sadece evsizler için bir gece barınağı ve gündüzleri kalamıyorsunuz çoğu evsiz aktif kullanıcılar ve oda veya başka bir şey yok sadece bölünmüş yataklar

bu topluluktaki onu tanıyan çoğu insan ailesini ve onu seviyor ve evliliğimiz hakkında kötü bir görüşe sahipler kanada'ya vatandaş olabilmek için geldiğimi ve bir sahtekar olduğumu düşünüyor en azından evlenmeden önce bunu söylemişti biliyorum yardım isteyebileceğim çoğu insanın onun tarafında olacağından veya sorunu çözmeye çalışacağından eminim, böylece evlilik devam eder, kavgalarımızda bir kez bebeği bana vereceğini ve onu memleketime geri götüreceğini söyledi, umarım doğum belgesi geldikten sonra ona bir pasaport alabilirim

pazartesiden cumartesiye kadar çalışıyor, bu yüzden pazar günleri ve pazartesi günleri dışında onu pek göremiyorum, çünkü yeni yıl tatili var

benim için endişelendiğin için teşekkürler, güncelleme olmazsa seni bilgilendirmeye devam edeceğim, muhtemelen interneti tekrar kapatmıştır

"Every single evening I hear the neighbors' toddler scream and sometimes say ""nooooooo!"" It sometimes goes on for hours and then suddenly stops. It's happened almost every evening since I moved in a few months ago and usually right after the father gets home.

I don't have kids and I don't really know the neighbors since I just moved here. I don't want to overreact so please tell me if it's crazy to even think about it. I would just feel horrible if they were abusing their child and I didn't do anything.

Is calling CPS crazy? What about a welfare check from the cops?

I'm not usually a nosy neighbor but the sounds are so heartbreaking to me.","her akşam komşunun yürümeye başlayan çocuğunun çığlık attığını ve bazen hayır dediğini duyuyorum, bazen saatlerce sürüyor ve sonra aniden duruyor, birkaç ay önce taşındığımdan beri neredeyse her akşam oluyor ve genellikle baba eve geldikten hemen sonra

çocuk koruma servisini aramak çılgınlık mı, polislerden bir sosyal yardım çeki ne olacak

"For this post, I'll assume the escort's name is R. I got to know through a mutual that R offers sex services. I've had a pretty shitty year and lately I've had a lot of pent up stress but nobody to talk to. So I took R's number from my friend and asked if she's up for a session.

We discussed the charges and I agreed to keep it at my place last night. When we met, I was visibly very nervous and my heart was pounding out of my chest. She asked me if this was my first time. I told her I don't know if I wanted to have sex or ifI just needed someone to talk to. 

We ended up talking for almost 2 hours before she got a call from someone else and had to leave. Before leaving, she gave me a hug and told me that this was fun. 

I handed her the money but she laughed and said there's no need and that she'd love to talk to me again someday. 

I feel better than before but I also feel guilty. I took up her time and I want to repay her but I don't know how. Any advice?

"My husband yelled at me the other day when I went to take the dog for a walk because I remembered I had a card to post and ran upstairs to get it. He caught me coming downstairs and said I was cruel to the dog making her wait ( it was less than a few minutes) I was a bad dog owner, shouldn't have a dog, am selfish ect. I told him he was being ridiculous and the dog was fine. The card never did get delivered. Anyway he carries on this argument when I get back. I told him I was sick of being put down  - I was accused of being over sensitive,dramatic, childish and then came the worst thing he has said that I must have lied about my ex's behaviour as I am a drama queen and so sensitive and he probably wasn't that bad - Context-  my ex was cruel and abusive and made mine and my daughters' lives a living hell, he mentally abused us all, financially abused me,  he even physically attacked us. I have witnesses and police records and court records, social service records to prove it and had PTSD after it. 
He can't understand why him saying that is so wrong. I am devastated my new husband believes that or would if he doesn't believe it, would say it to be cruel 😢 
Am I being too sensitive as he says? or is this too much? I honestly am questioning my marriage. We have been married 2 years.

(27F)
Long story short, my ex was abusive and I was afraid of men for a while. 
Now my guy friend is coming over tonight to hang out. (We’ve known each other about a year, but have been flirting and such)
 
I trust him and fear isn’t the issue, but I forget how to be fun and flirty. I forget what it’s like to have sex. 

I’ve had sex hundreds of times (6 men total) and it never hurt, even with the.. big ones. However, *i just had a Pap test….. and it hurt so much.*

He’s probably going to stay overnight, do I offer for him to sleep in my bed? 

Will I seem like a slut if I wanna have sex with him? 

It’s been so long I know it will hurt..

Do I cuddle with him while watching Netflix?

I feel like a teenager again, not knowing what to do 🤣

Edit : he came over and we cuddled and had sex, it was great 😊 he was gentle and respectful, well maybe not in the sheets but that’s how I like it 😉🙊 sorry tmi","f
uzun lafın kısası eski sevgilim tacizciydi ve bir süredir erkeklerden korkuyordum
şimdi erkek arkadaşım bu gece takılmak için yanıma geliyor yaklaşık bir yıldır tanışıyoruz ama flört ediyoruz falan

ona güveniyorum ve korku sorun değil ama nasıl eğlenceli ve cilveli olunacağını unuttum seks yapmanın nasıl bir şey olduğunu unuttum

toplamda yüzlerce kez erkeklerle seks yaptım ve büyük olanlarla bile hiç acımadı ama az önce pap testi yaptırdım ve çok acıdı

muhtemelen geceyi benimle geçirecek yatağımda uyumasını teklif etmeli miyim

onunla seks yapmak istersem orospu gibi mi görünürüm

çok uzun zaman oldu biliyorum acıyacak

netflix izlerken ona sarılmalı mıyım

ne yapacağımı bilemeden tekrar genç gibi hissediyorum

düzenle geldi ve sarılıp seks yaptık harikaydı nazik ve saygılıydı belki çarşaflarda değil ama ben böyle seviyorum üzgünüm tmi"
"We are a parent of one and I have expressed to him so many times I would like to sleep in and not be the only one that gets up with our child at 6:30 every morning. Every single time he has said that he’s going to get up I have to wake him up and ask him several times to get up that ends up being him coming into the kitchen and banging everything around because he’s so upset. This morning the same thing happened and after I kept asking him are you going to get up with her and keep your word or are you gonna make me get up with her again? Keep repeating that I am the most annoying person in this world that he’s ever met and continues to come in the kitchen and start being around getting her food ready. I tried to consult him with how I felt and how he’s acting and he just kept dismissing me and telling me to go back to sleep. At this point I felt like nothing is going to change and he honestly doesn’t care at all about my feelings, and I am very sick right now with strep.

"My girlfriend (26) and I (27) have lived together for a little more than 3 years and while she was getting her degree, I worked to support us both. Once she finished, she got a job that made far more than I did, so I left my job and we moved. This worked out fine, as the plan was always for me to go back and finish my degree once she got a solid job. However, less than a year into her job, the company downsized and she lost her job. She was able to find another before our savings ran out and we thought all was good. Sadly, after only 3 months, she was let go again (along with many on her team) due to ""company restructuring"". I don't think that's enough time for unemployment (we live in Massachusetts) and now we have no idea what to do. We have just over a month's rent saved and we have no idea if she can get another job in time.

I can't exactly leave school for two reasons: A) her parents are paying for my schooling and will refuse any other support until I graduate (they're...strange) and B) I'm required by her parents to attend school fulltime and graduate on time for us to get eventually married (and not have myself and her essentially shunned by her family)

My family can't do anything other than wise us well as they're poor. 

I've never felt so useless and trapped in my life. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know what course of action to take in order to get us out of this situation other than hoping that she can find another job.

Looking for any advice


Edit: she's got a degree in biomedical engineering and while I have a years experience in QA/QC for food, I don't have a degree for it and I'm currently in school for Computer Science/Cyber Security and I have two semesters left

"I’m visiting my bf for the week, and generally we do sleep naked. Annoying issue is that his bedroom and bathroom are NOT connected. They’re super close, like within the same corner, but you do have to go out to use it. It was maybe like 3 am and I needed to take a piss, so I decide to just make a run for it. His roommate also just happened to go into the kitchen at this time, lucky me! To be honest, I did not see his roommate, as the bathroom is in a corner away from most of the kitchen view, but I knew he came out because he turned the lights on just as I ran into the bathroom and closed the door.

He did not say anything to me, and I think there might be a chance he didn’t see? I’m assuming since he was not in my view that I might not have been in his… also it was quite dark. 

Should I apologize or just pretend it never happened?? 

Also I would NEVER just be naked in the communal areas, as it’s not my space. It was just “midnight suddenly have to pee” rush, so I don’t think I was thinking clearly :,)

Edit: context for common comments
- Yes my bf knows and thought it was pretty funny
- No I am not the gf POV of the other post LOL
- No it’s not a communal bathroom. Roommate has his own bathroom but it’s within his bedroom. Bf’s bedroom and bathroom are within the same corner. You walk out the bedroom and it’s immediately on the right
- Bf’s roommate and I are not “friends” per say, but we’re friendly so not total strangers 
- for the creeps who keep dming me, no, roommate did not get a hard on seeing me

"So my dog died the other day, it was really hard. I had him for 9 years and I was really sad. So, I wanted to talk to my teacher about it (btw the class he teaches is meant to help kids with issues they are having, kinda like a free therapist) and I went to talk to him and I gave him all the details and he said “animals die, just move on”. Was this disrespectful? I think so because I’m sure he wouldn’t wanna hear that if his pet died. I just don’t know what to do.

"**UPDATE: I have had a lengthy conversation with my husband. I was open and calm and did my best to let him know I wasn’t accusing him of infidelity. He was shocked but could understand where I’m coming to once I explained how I’m feeling.
He said since my surgery I’ve made such a massive improvement with my health that he’s felt a little unneeded. I guess because I can now do so much more in one day than I’ve been able to do for years I’ve just been doing them, I’ve loved feeling useful again. So he’s been leaning on other friendships. And he hadn’t really thought about how that newer friendship with his coworker could look from the outside. 
We’ve agreed that we need to work on our communication and on doing more things as a couple. We’ve also agreed that we will all go as a family on the next hunting/camping trip even though our kids will miss a sport or club day. 
He’s given me all of his passwords and offered to let me go through his phone and even taken the password off to get into his phone but I’ve decided that’s not necessary. I do trust my husband. 
He did make sure to show me one long conversation he had with his coworker a week ago and it was all about how proud he is of how far I’ve come this year and how I fought to have the doctors do the surgery that’s changed everything about my health. 
So now I kinda feel like a jerk. 
We both agree we need to put in some extra effort into us. And I’m excited for whatever our next chapter is.
I don’t know if this is the update everyone wanted but it’s what I’ve got to give**





So the title basically says it all, but for a bit more info:

My husband (37m) and I (37f) have been together for over 20 years (high school sweethearts) and married for almost half that. We have 2 kids together and are mostly very happy. Like most relationships we have issues but they are mainly small.

Over the last 2 years my husband has made friends with a few people from his work with very similar interests with him. I have been very supportive of this as I love seeing him happy. 
I should add that for the last decade I have been very sick. I’ve barely been able to do much physically outside of raising our kids. But this last year after a very important surgery I am more active than I’ve ever been in my adult life!
The problem is over the last 8-10 months my husband has been getting closer to one of his coworkers. He goes camping/hiking/hunting with a few coworkers quite often while I stay home with the kids who have a lot of sports on weekends so we can’t take them. 
And earlier this year my husband went on a month long work trip overseas and this coworker went too. Since then he talks about her daily. He talks to her multiple times a day even on days they aren’t working together or even at all. He doesn’t message me while he’s at work unless it’s to ask if he needs to stop at the supermarket on his way home. But I recently found out they message each other almost hourly.

I’m conflicted because we recently attended her wedding. She’s very kind and friendly and seems truly in love with her now husband. But even during her wedding she was insisting on dancing with my husband and getting dozens of selfies with him… he only took one selfie with me for the whole night and that’s because I asked. 

I love my husband and I don’t think they are having a traditional affair. But it does feel like an unintentional emotional affair. It makes me feel uncomfortable and to be honest sad. 

Should I try and talk to him about this? Or should I just stay quiet?
I don’t want him to stop attending his hunting/camping trips and I really don’t want to be the wife who controls who her husband is friends with. ","güncelleme kocamla uzun bir konuşma yaptım açık ve sakindim ve onu aldatmakla suçlamadığımı ona bildirmek için elimden geleni yaptım şok olmuştu ama hissettiklerimi açıkladıktan sonra nereye varmak istediğimi anlayabiliyordu

ikimiz de kendimize biraz daha fazla çaba sarf etmemiz gerektiği konusunda hemfikiriz ve bir sonraki bölümümüz ne olursa olsun heyecanlıyım
bunun herkesin istediği güncelleme olup olmadığını bilmiyorum ama verebileceğim şey bu

başlık aslında her şeyi söylüyor ama biraz daha fazla bilgi için

kocam m ve ben lise aşıkları olarak yıllardır birlikteyiz ve neredeyse yarısı evliyiz çocuklarımız var ve çoğunlukla çok mutluyuz çoğu ilişkide olduğu gibi sorunlarımız var ama bunlar çoğunlukla küçük

son yıllarda kocam işinden onunla çok benzer ilgi alanlarına sahip birkaç kişiyle arkadaş oldu ben de onu mutlu görmekten hoşlandığım için buna çok destek oldum
eklemeliyim ki son on yıldır çok hastaydım çocuklarımızı büyütmek dışında fiziksel olarak pek bir şey yapamadım ama bu son yıl çok önemli bir ameliyattan sonra daha çok yetişkin hayatımda hiç olmadığım kadar aktifim
sorun şu ki son aylarda kocam iş arkadaşlarından biriyle yakınlaşıyor kamp yapmaya, yürüyüşe, avlanmaya gidiyor birkaç iş arkadaşıyla sık sık ben de hafta sonları çok fazla spor yapan çocuklarla evde kalıyorum bu yüzden onları götüremiyoruz
ve bu yılın başlarında kocam bir aylık bir yurtdışı iş gezisine gitti ve o zamandan beri bu iş arkadaşı da gitti her gün ondan bahsediyor günde birkaç kez onunla konuşuyor hatta birlikte çalışmadıkları günlerde bile hatta hiç konuşmadıkları zamanlarda bile işteyken bana mesaj atmıyor eve giderken süpermarkette durması gerekip gerekmediğini sormak dışında ama yakın zamanda neredeyse her saat mesajlaştıklarını öğrendim

karışık bir ruh hali içindeyim çünkü yakın zamanda düğününe katıldık çok nazik ve arkadaş canlısı ve şimdiki kocasına gerçekten aşık gibi görünüyor ama düğünü sırasında bile kocamla dans etmekte ve onunla düzinelerce selfie çektirmekte ısrar ediyordu bütün gece boyunca benimle sadece bir selfie çektirdi ve bunun sebebi benim sormam

kocamı seviyorum ve geleneksel bir ilişkileri olduğunu düşünmüyorum ama sanki istemsiz duygusal bir ilişki beni rahatsız ediyor ve dürüst olmak gerekirse üzüyor

bu konuda onunla konuşmayı denemeli miyim yoksa sadece sessiz mi kalmalıyım
av kamp gezilerine katılmayı bırakmasını istemiyorum ve kocasının kiminle arkadaş olacağını kontrol eden bir eş olmak istemiyorum"

( Please don’t refer this post with my previous posts and comments it has nothing to do with my kinks and preferences. It is a genuine issue that I am facing and really would appreciate your help. ) ( THIS IS NOT A KINK RELATED POST) 

I(21f) had always thought I had a good relationship with my Girl friends and boyfriend. We would hang out all the time, go to parties, and just have fun together. But something happened recently that has completely shattered my trust in them.

I was using my boyfriend's laptop to look something up when I stumbled upon a group chat between him and my friends. At first, I didn't think much of it, but as I scrolled through the messages, my heart sank. They were making fun of me, calling me names like ""cow boobs,"" ""watermelon boobs,"" and ""saggy titts"" “milkers” “pendulum ass” and many more things while objectifying every part of my body behind my back.

I couldn't believe what I was reading. These were my friends, people I trusted and confided in. And yet, they were making fun of my body, something I've always been self-conscious about.

But it didn't stop there. They were also sharing pictures of me, taken without my knowledge or consent. Pictures of me in embarrassing situations, or wearing something they found funny or were small on me. They even shared the most shameful things that had happened to me.

I felt sick to my stomach. I couldn't understand how they could do this to me. I thought we were close, that we had a bond that went beyond petty insults and mean-spirited jokes.

What's worse is that they don't know that I am aware of this chat. I accidentally saw it on my boyfriend's laptop while using it to upload my assignments , and the chats date back to 3years ago when I started uni with these girls. It's all so fresh, and I can't believe that they are still doing this to me.

I don't know what to do? Or how to approach the situation and even deal with it myself. I'm hurt, and I feel betrayed by the people I trusted the most. 

Edit: please don’t refer this post with my previous posts and comments it has nothing to do with my kinks and preferences. It is a genuine issue that I am facing and really would appreciate your help. 

Edit 2: I have gotten the advice and input that I was looking for to give me more clarity on the situation on how to react. Thanks you so much for taking out the time to share your thoughts. I will update you once I take any action about it and let you know how it goes. Once again thanks a lot to everyone who gave genuine advice and support. 

And the those who don’t believe it, I don’t care  I am done trying to convince you, hope you have a nice day and be a better person rather than just mocking someone’s pain and problem.

erkek arkadaşımın dizüstü bilgisayarını bir şeye bakmak için kullanırken onun ve arkadaşlarımın bir grup sohbetine rastladım ilk başta pek önemsemedim ama mesajlara göz gezdirdikçe kalbim duracak gibi oldu benimle dalga geçiyorlardı inek memeleri karpuz memeleri ve sarkık memeler süt verenlerin sarkık götü ve daha birçok şey gibi isimler takıyorlardı ve vücudumun her yerini arkamdan nesneleştiriyorlardı

okuduklarıma inanamadım bunlar güvendiğim ve sırdaşlık ettiğim arkadaşlarımdı ve yine de vücudumla dalga geçiyorlardı bu her zaman kendimi bilinçli hissettiğim bir şeydi

ama bununla bitmedi ayrıca benim bilgim veya iznim olmadan çekilmiş resimlerimi de paylaşıyorlardı beni utandırıcı durumlarda veya komik buldukları veya üzerimde küçük duran bir şey giydiklerinde bile başıma gelen en utanç verici şeyleri paylaştılar

midem bulandı, bana bunu nasıl yapabildiklerini anlayamadım, yakın olduğumuzu düşünüyordum, küçük hakaretlerin ve kötü niyetli şakaların ötesine geçen bir bağımız vardı

daha da kötüsü, bu sohbetten haberdar olduğumu bilmiyorlar, ödevlerimi yüklemek için kullandığım sırada yanlışlıkla erkek arkadaşımın dizüstü bilgisayarında gördüm ve sohbetler üniversiteye başladığım yıllara dayanıyor, bu kızlarla her şey çok taze ve bana hala bunu yaptıklarına inanamıyorum

ne yapacağımı veya duruma nasıl yaklaşacağımı ve hatta kendim nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum, incindim ve en güvendiğim insanlar tarafından ihanete uğramış hissediyorum

"I met this woman while I was working my first ever job at a local bowling alley so I'm roughly 17 at the time I'm now 22. This severely autistic lady is a regular at the alley and she never had anyone to bowl with which caught me off guard because although she is a fully grown adult that I've seen take public transport and shop all by herself I just don't think she should be left alone. S

 I could tell she had serious anxiety because when she was alone doing her own thing she would constantly play with her hair and violently rock back and fourth while sitting down or standing up, and repeat a single word over and over again usually ""Hi"". She would also routinely go up to my coworkers and say ""Hi"" 4 or 5 times, and my coworkers would write her off and treat her like a pest which I thought was wrong to me it just seemed like she wanted some acknowledgment so I would say hi to her whenever she came in. This went from a casual greeting, to her forcing a hug saying bye and then asking when I would be back, to literally screaming my name whenever she saw me, and even disturbing the entire alley because she was just repeating my name over and over again.

Fast forward to today I'm no longer working at the alley but anytime I go there and while she's there she's the happiest woman in the world. 

The problem here is she takes pictures of me and my family without permission, and gets very passive aggressive when other women come around me including my own mother. Like the alley had this stupid couples game tourney and I played with a girl I liked and when this lady found out she started SOBBING. I mean textbook emotional breakdown. She forced me to give out my phone number the other day....I blocked her but god dude she's called 5 times in 3 days.

It sort of worked out because I was able to get her full name in the process and after a bit of digging I found her sister(s) on social media. I thought about taking this to them but its really not their problem I was the one that let it spiral out of control like this. I have a hard time saying no and I don't like hurting peoples feelings :((

I'm just looking for alternative perspective and advice.

A family friend is telling me next time I see her approach her with my brother by my side (in case she gets violent) and respectfully tell her we're done. no friendship. no contact. Everyone I spoke with pretty much agrees thats the best route.



","bu kadınla ilk işimde yerel bir bowling salonunda çalışırken tanıştım, o zamanlar yaklaşık olarak şu an bu şiddetli otistik kadın bowling salonuna düzenli olarak geliyor ve bowling oynayacak hiç kimsesi olmuyordu, bu beni hazırlıksız yakaladı çünkü toplu taşımayı kullanan ve tek başına alışveriş yapan yetişkin bir kadın olmasına rağmen yalnız bırakılmaması gerektiğini düşünüyorum s

ciddi kaygı yaşadığını söyleyebilirim çünkü yalnızken kendi işini yaparken sürekli saçıyla oynuyor ve otururken veya ayağa kalkarken şiddetli bir şekilde ileri geri sallanıyor ve tek bir kelimeyi tekrar tekrar tekrarlıyordu, genellikle merhaba, ayrıca düzenli olarak iş arkadaşlarımın yanına gidip merhaba veya saatler diyordu ve iş arkadaşlarım onu ​​önemsemiyor ve ona bir haşere gibi davranıyorlardı, ki bu benim için yanlıştı, sadece biraz onay istiyor gibiydi, bu yüzden içeri girdiğinde ona merhaba diyordum, bu sıradan bir selamlamadan, beni zorla kucaklamaya ve elveda demeye ve sonra ne zaman döneceğimi sormaya, beni gördüğünde tam anlamıyla adımı haykırmaya ve hatta sadece olduğu için tüm salonu rahatsız etmeye kadar gitti adımı tekrar tekrar söylüyor

bugüne hızlıca ilerleyelim, artık sokakta çalışmıyorum ama oraya her gittiğimde ve o oradayken dünyanın en mutlu kadını oluyor

buradaki sorun, izinsiz olarak benim ve ailemin fotoğraflarını çekmesi ve etrafımda başka kadınlar olduğunda çok pasif agresif olması, kendi annem de dahil olmak üzere, sokakta aptalca bir çiftler turnuvası vardı ve ben de sevdiğim bir kızla oynadım ve bu kadın öğrendiğinde hıçkırarak ağlamaya başladı, yani ders kitabı duygusal çöküntü yaşadı, geçen gün telefon numaramı vermem için beni zorladı, onu engelledim ama aman Tanrım, günlerce aradı

bir şekilde işe yaradı çünkü süreçte tam adını alabildim ve biraz araştırdıktan sonra sosyal medyada kız kardeşlerini buldum, bunu onlara götürmeyi düşündüm ama bu gerçekten onların sorunu değil, bu şekilde kontrolden çıkmasına izin veren bendim, hayır demek zor geliyor ve insanların duygularını incitmekten hoşlanmıyorum

sadece alternatif bir bakış açısı ve tavsiye arıyorum

bir aile dostum, bir dahaki sefere onu gördüğümde kardeşim yanımdayken ona yaklaştığını söylüyor, eğer olursa Şiddetli ve saygılı bir şekilde ona ne yaptığımızı söyle, arkadaşlık yok, iletişim yok, konuştuğum herkes bunun en iyi yol olduğunu söylüyor"

Okay so I bit of a weird one here. So me and my friends recently went up to a girls cottage with a bunch of the girl I’ve been seeing’s friends, as well as my friends. Friday night comes around and everyone’s having a great time. This one girl is making it very obvious that she wants to get together that night. I turn her down 3+ times and make it clear I’m very interested in her friend. This particular friend has a history of sleeping with her friend’s dating interests. Fast forward a bit and it’s 3am and we decided to go for a late night lake swim. I was drinking at this point, but nowhere near blackout. 20 minutes go by and the last thing I really remember is getting out of the lake and putting a towel over my waist. I remember other details from after that vaguely but it’s like I had no control over my thoughts or actions (hard to explain) kind of like a zombie like state where I just go with the flow without thinking. I wake up in the girls bed and had slept with her that night. 2 days later when I get home I go to the hospital for a drug test since I knew this was out of character for me (I don’t sleep around and I didn’t drink enough to be blackout) and I tested positive for MDMA. I don’t do drugs and have no desire to do them. This info of me sleeping with the friend obviously got back to the girl I was seeing, and I haven’t heard from her since it happened. (We would text everyday, it’s been 3 days since I’ve heard from her. I haven’t told her or anybody about the drug test results yet, as I’m one to think heavily before I do things. My question is will she understand what happened if I tell her? Will she even believe me? I have the drug test and a phone call from the doctor as proof that I had drugs in my system. And even if I tell her, will that fix things to where we can see each other again? I still slept with her friend and my scare is even though I had no control over it, she will think it’s awkward every time we hang out as a group, and won’t want to continue things. I’m also not 100% sure that it was her who spiked the drink, as she seemed like a pretty normal girl. Last thing I want to do is cause drama in this girls friend group. Any help is appreciated. Thanks ","tamam, burada biraz garip bir durum var, arkadaşlarımla yakın zamanda bir kızın evine gittik, arkadaşlarımın ve arkadaşlarımın görüştüğü bir grup kızla birlikteydik, cuma gecesi geliyor ve herkes harika vakit geçiriyor, bir kız o gece birlikte olmak istediğini çok belli ediyor, onun boş zamanlarını geri çeviriyorum ve arkadaşıyla çok ilgilendiğimi açıkça belirtiyorum, bu arkadaşın arkadaşlarının flört ilgi alanlarıyla yatma geçmişi var, biraz ileri saralım, sabah oldu ve gece geç saatlerde gölde yüzmeye karar verdik, o sırada içiyordum ama bayılmaya yakın değildim, dakikalar geçiyor ve gerçekten hatırladığım son şey gölden çıkıp belime bir havlu sarmak, ondan sonraki diğer ayrıntıları belirsiz bir şekilde hatırlıyorum ama sanki düşüncelerim veya eylemlerim üzerinde hiçbir kontrolüm yokmuş gibi, açıklaması zor, bir zombi gibi, hiç düşünmeden akışa bırakılıyorum, kızın yatağında uyanıyorum ve o gece onunla yattım, günler sonra eve geldiğimde uyuşturucu testi için hastaneye gidiyorum, çünkü bunun benim karakterime uymadığını biliyordum, ortalıkta dolaşmıyorum ve bayılacak kadar içmedim ve mdma için pozitif çıktı uyuşturucu kullanmıyorum ve kullanma isteğim yok arkadaşımla yattığım bu bilgi belli ki görüştüğüm kıza geri döndü ve olaydan beri ondan haber almadım her gün mesajlaşıyorduk ondan haber alalı gün oldu ona veya herhangi birine uyuşturucu test sonuçlarını söylemedim henüz çünkü bir şey yapmadan önce iyice düşünen biriyim sorum şu ona söylersem ne olduğunu anlayacak mı bana inanacak mı uyuşturucu testim ve doktordan aldığım telefon görüşmesi sistemimde uyuşturucu olduğunun kanıtı ve ona söylesem bile birbirimizi tekrar görebileceğimiz şekilde düzelecek mi hala arkadaşıyla yattım ve korkum kontrolüm olmasa bile bir grup olarak her takıldığımızda bunu garip bulacak ve devam etmek istemeyecek ayrıca içkiye ilaç atanın o olduğundan da emin değilim çünkü gayet normal bir kız gibi görünüyordu yapmak istediğim son şey bu kız arkadaş grubunda drama yaratmak her türlü yardımınız için teşekkür ederim"
"So I am not against the LGBT COMMUNITY in anyway,shape or form.

But I am getting married in the next six months I am from South Africa and my Fiancé is from Asia. We decided to have a wedding in South Africa. His family is coming all the way from Asia to attend the wedding. As Asians are extremely family oriented and my family and I hardly tolerate each other. I moved away for a reason a lot of trauma. 
 
He comes from a Catholic household and I converted as well it’s important to note that I come from a family with no religious background. 

So here is where the trouble comes. My sister is married to a woman and although I do not care they are extremely loving in public I am sure everyone knows of a couple who you can’t talk to because they are constantly making out with each other it’s really intense I am not the first to complain.

My fiancé and his family come from a culture where they are respectful towards people and don’t show public display of affection because they don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable.

How do I bring this up without sounding like I have a problem with them being gay because she uses that card a lot when being called out on something. 

I am not looking for hate I just want to keep everyone comfortable and happy

"Today, I woke up at 6:29am. My bus gets to my house at 6:30, so I panicked, got dressed, woke my 8yo brother up, got him changed, and got on the bus. I didn’t have time to go downstairs to the basement to wake up my 17yo brother, and as a result, I’m being punished by standing in the corner for one hour. Is this an appropriate punishment for my age? I’m not sure, so I went to Reddit. I need advice to make up another punishment that will not potentially affect me in the future.

Edit: I’m really shocked with all the comments i’ve been receiving. Thank you. I’ve seen some comments saying I should just refuse, but I really cant. I would if I could. As for some background information, my 17yo brother is very favored, so I get punished more than him ,(naturally). I’m glad to say that they forgot to even put me in the corner for this, as they’re too busy getting drunk. They really are nice people, I can’t really see this as any form of abuse. They feed me, house me, etc. It’s natural i’d have to listen to them without any resistance. Sorry if I yapped a bit. Thank you guys.","bugün sabah uyandım, otobüsüm evime varıyor, bu yüzden panikledim, giyindim, kardeşimi uyandırdım, üzerini değiştirdim ve otobüse bindim, kardeşimi uyandırmak için bodruma inecek vaktim olmadı ve sonuç olarak bir saat köşede dikilerek cezalandırılıyorum, yaşım için uygun bir ceza mı emin değilim, bu yüzden reddit'e gittim, gelecekte beni etkilemeyecek başka bir ceza için tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var

" My (f23) porn addicted husband (m26) said he finds my body boring.

My husband has struggled with a p0rn addiction his whole life, during the course of our 8 month marriage during the beginning we both agreed to a no p0rn rule. 

It went over both of our boundaries supposedly. Well multiple times during these months I’ve caught him watching it, just sneakier and sneakier. I’m a woman with very low confidence and it makes me uncomfortable knowing my s/o uses others to get off. Each time I’ve been understanding &amp; non-judgmental but have expressed that it upsets me and have cried begging him to change and stop, he always says he will. 

Yesterday I caught him again (look at their instagram clicked link history ladies) &amp; found porn &amp; OF models. This time I was angry at first, because the last time I caught him was only a month ago and I poured my heart out to him. But afterwards I comforted him, and I asked him why doesn’t he just use the countless nudes and videos I’ve sent him instead, he replied with “it’s like my brain finds it boring, it’s old, it’s the same” and I think that completely and utterly broke me, hearing my husband refer to my naked body as “boring”. I’m someone who has suffered deep depression due to body dysmorphia and low self esteem, so hearing that come from the man I’ve been so vulnerable with was irreversible damage. I can’t look at him and I don’t want him to touch me or look at me, I start hyperventilating when I think about it. I don’t think I’m strong enough mentally to go through this.


Questions: How can I get through this? How can I help myself while also helping him? He wants to change how can I help him?

dün onu tekrar yakaladım, instagram'larına baktım, tıklanan bağlantı geçmişi, bayanlar ve porno ve modeller buldum, bu sefer ilk başta sinirlendim çünkü onu en son bir ay önce yakalamıştım ve ona içimi döktüm ama sonra onu rahatlattım ve neden ona gönderdiğim sayısız çıplak fotoğrafı ve videoyu kullanmıyor diye sordum, sanki beynim bunu sıkıcı buluyormuş gibi, eski, aynı ve bence bu beni tamamen ve tümüyle kırdı kocam çıplak vücudumu sıkıcı olarak nitelendiriyor ben vücut dismorfisi ve düşük öz saygı nedeniyle derin depresyon geçiren biriyim bu yüzden bu kadar savunmasız olduğum adamdan bunu duymak geri dönüşü olmayan bir hasardı ona bakamıyorum ve bana dokunmasını veya bana bakmasını istemiyorum bunu düşündüğümde hiperventilasyon geçirmeye başlıyorum bunu atlatacak kadar zihinsel olarak güçlü olduğumu düşünmüyorum

Last night my dad found out that my mom kissed another guy when she was out dancing which isn’t even that bad he’s done way worse he’s slept with multiple different women and this is all she has done so I don’t think he really has the right to flip out he was screaming at her all night and the bedroom is next to my room so I heard it all not to mention this is the night right before my first day of grade 10 and it kept me up all night so I didn’t get a wink of sleep (I didn’t end up going to the first day just because I can’t bring myself to get ready) anyways sorry if I’m rambling but I’ll get to the point they are going through a divorce right now but his plane leaves on the 11th so he can’t really go anywhere because he is originally from Australia but I felt like I needed to say that because they are having any sex anywyas they haven’t for years but then he made her last night and she was like screaming and crying apparently that’s what she told me because I went outside so I didn’t hear it thank god anyways I fucking hate my dad so much I don’t even want to look at him or ever speak to him again it grosses me out to even call him dad after this and after everything he had done  tbh because he used to beat the living shit out of me and my brother ☠️🙏 anyways I don’t know what to do I can’t stop breaking down and crying over this is this situation even bad?

"Back with another update for those who asked! Cant believe its been over 3 months now

We applied for kinship and have had the provisional approval and the home inspection and some interviews. We’ve got a couple more things to do/still ongoing and then we should be good! We got our first payment which has been SO GOOD and really made me feel much more optimistic about everything bc we will be able to actually do something other than just survive. The case worker pretty much told me they dont want to have to find placements for this many kids so us keeping them is their much preferred option which is reassuring

My mum hasnt contacted me for a while. We thought she might show up on easter bc holidays are usually her time to cry about how much she misses our dad, and she usually prefers to ruin everyones day with that. But she didnt come thank god. Our nan is still at our aunties bc she cant stand to be around us apparently. Bc me trying to feed them good food and not let a 7 year old disappear for hours on bicycles with kids 3+ years old than her is just me thinking im better than my nan!!! 

A lot of people said to trying cosleep with 7yr old so i have started doing that. It’s helping a bit and she actually will lay down so thats a win but she still cries a lot and tries to get up. She also does a death grip on me so I have kind of accepted that i have to go to bed when she does. Its not the worst thing ever bc i have been looking things up and reading online whilst i lay with her when she eventually calms down. 

I’ve ordered melatonin to try. I share a room with 16yr old and she doesnt want 7yr old in there but its kind of tough. I cant do anything about it until we can move house which isnt going to be soon. Its not the most peaceful night with her in there bc she kicks me and wakes up at random times trying to chat or crying but we are getting some sleep. 

She slept in my single bed with me from 4 months old until she was like 2 (I clearly knew nothing about safe sleep but my mum had sold the crib to try to annoy my dad so she actually had no where else to sleep) and i havent told her that bc I dont want to tell her her mum didnt care that she didnt have a bed, but she seems to remember bc she said “we used to have sleepovers in your bed a lot didnt we”🥺
Also i got 16yr old earplugs and told her she can sleep in 7yr olds bed in the other room if she prefers

I do my best to try to soothe 7yr old in general. She had one of her crying breakdowns last week and said she didnt feel safe or happy. Then she said she wishes i was her real mummy. I told her I am her real mummy bc I’ve looked after her her whole life and I won’t ever leave her. She seems a bit happier since then. Im going to get a photo of us for her to have in her little purse she carries everywhere. She’s pretty sentimental so she will like that. Yesterday she asked me if me and our brother are married lol obviously I said no and she said “i just feel like you are my mum and dad”. I hope thats a good thing even if it is a little weird. She is definitely bonding with him too. She always wants me to carry her around and when I say no bc I’m busy, he offers to do it and she lets him now. She used to ignore him. Seeing her snuggle into his neck and actually relax is the cutest thing. Makes my heart happy bc I remember wishing I had a dad who would hold me and i’m so glad she is getting all the love❤️❤️❤️

Me and my brother have had a few disagreements over discipline. He is pretty strict and usually thats a good thing bc they need it tbh but sometimes I find it a bit much. Biggest disagreement was when he smacked 9yr old and I lost my shit. We grew up with a lot lot worse and ngl i have smacked them before but I dont want to be doing that anymore. Bro thinks there’s nothing wrong with 1 smack on the bum. I would just rather we dont go there. He said he wont do it again and i dont think he will. He wasn’t angry when he did it so im not really concerned about it and he apologised to 9yr old. We’re just still trying to figure out discipline. Our dad used an electric cord as a whip so one smack on the bum is practically gentle parenting to us. I have read enough to know we dont want to be doing any physical disciplining though 

Worst thing ive had to do is give the youngest 2 suppositories. My sister gave me money to take them to the gp bc i was worried about them and couldnt find any for free and didnt want to wait for kinship. Turns out they are both malnourished underweight and constipated af. And they’ve missed some vaccines. For the constipation we tried medicine and more fibre and more water but no bueno so it had to be the suppositories bc the doctor said it was verging on severe. I tried to explain it to them and make the whole thing easy but it turned into quite the drama. 9yr old was easier but still took me a while. 7yr old was impossible and everyone got too stressed on day 1 so we left it and she was still not complying on day 2 so my brother had to get involved and pretty much had to hold her down. Bc I called the doctor and she said either we do it or i take her in and they do it. So we had no choice really and i still feel horrible about it. I’m obsessed with what they’re eating now bc I do not want anyone going through that again. But i will say they are a lot lot better since. They arent getting tummy aches and they arent so grouchy. And it has helped 7yr old with her sleep for sure

We are getting the other 3 to the doctor next week. We will do telehealth after but i want them to see someone in person for the first appointment. After that the next thing on the list is dentist. We have looked at therapy and should be getting telehealth sessions soon. So far all 3 teenagers have said they arent doing  therapy but I will try to make them at least try it

16yr old is still difficult. She took my ID and she was going out whenever she liked. But my brother grounded her and she has actually listened and not tried to sneak out 

The other 3 are doing ok. No big issues with them tbh they are adapting pretty well i think. I try to talk to them all about everything when i can and they all seem to understand whats going on and trust that we wont be going anywhere and we just need them to cooperate with us so we can get through. My little brother J(12) is obsesssed with older bro. I used to have an issue with J going out every evening for hours and was so stressed about trying to keep him home and safe but Matt being here has basically eliminated the issue. J just wants to be around him allll the time and Matt has somehow got this kid thinking doing homework with him is the BEST thing ever 

Sorry this is so long again! Idk how long i will keep doing these updates but for now everyone is so incredibly helpful that i will carry on posting bc i always need more advice

The advice and support from everyone in the comments and pm has been amazing and has actually helped change our day to day life for the better so thank u sm internet strangers ❤️

i do my best to try to soothe yr old in general she had one of her crying breakdowns last week and said she didnt feel safe or happy then she said she wishes i was her real mummy i told her i am her real mummy bc ive looked after her her whole life and i wont ever leave her she seems a bit happier since then im going to get a photo of us for her to have in her little purse she carries everywhere shes pretty sentimental so she will like that yesterday she asked me if me and our brother are married lol obviously i said no and she said i just feel like you are my mum and dad i hope thats a good thing even if it is a little weird she is definitely bonding with him too she always wants me to carry her around and when i say no bc im busy he offers to do it and she lets him now she used to ignore him seeing her snuggle into his neck and actually relax is the cutest thing makes my heart happy bc i remember wishing i had a dad who would hold me and im so glad she is getting all the love

me and my brother have had a few disagreements over discipline he is pretty strict and usually thats a good thing bc they need it tbh but sometimes i find it a bit much biggest disagreement was when he smacked yr old and i lost my shit we grew up with a lot lot worse and ngl i have smacked them before but i dont want to be doing that anymore bro thinks theres nothing wrong with  smack on the bum i would just rather we dont go there he said he wont do it again and i dont think he will he wasnt angry when he did it so im not really concerned about it and he apologised to yr old were just still trying to figure out discipline our dad used an electric cord as a whip so one smack on the bum is practically gentle parenting to us i have read enough to know we dont want to be doing any physical disciplining though 

worst thing ive had to do is give the youngest  suppositories my sister gave me money to take them to the gp bc i was worried about them and couldnt find any for free and didnt want to wait for kinship turns out they are both malnourished underweight and constipated af and theyve missed some vaccines for the constipation we tried medicine and more fibre and more water but no bueno so it had to be the suppositories bc the doctor said it was verging on severe i tried to explain it to them and make the whole thing easy but it turned into quite the drama yr old was easier but still took me a while yr old was impossible and everyone got too stressed on day  so we left it and she was still not complying on day  so my brother had to get involved and pretty much had to hold her down bc i called the doctor and she said eya biz yaparız ya da ben onu içeri alırım ve onlar yaparlar bu yüzden gerçekten başka seçeneğimiz yoktu ve hala bu konuda kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum şu anda ne yediklerine takıntılıyım çünkü kimsenin bunu tekrar yaşamasını istemiyorum ama şunu söyleyeceğim ki karın ağrıları çekmedikleri ve çok huysuz olmadıkları için çok çok daha iyiler ve kesinlikle oğlunuzun uykusuna yardımcı oldu

Diğerini gelecek hafta doktora götürüyoruz, sonrasında tele sağlık yapacağız ama ondan sonraki ilk randevuda şahsen birini görmelerini istiyorum listedeki bir sonraki şey dişçi, terapiye baktık ve yakında tele sağlık seansları almalıyız şu ana kadar tüm gençler terapiye gitmediklerini söyledi ama en azından denemelerini sağlamaya çalışacağım

Oğlu hala zor, kimliğimi aldı ve istediği zaman dışarı çıkıyordu ama kardeşim onu ​​cezalandırdı ve aslında dinledi ve gizlice dışarı çıkmaya çalışmadı

Diğerleri iyi, dürüst olmak gerekirse onlarla ilgili büyük bir sorun yok, oldukça iyi uyum sağlıyorlar bence onlarla her şey hakkında konuşmaya çalışıyorum mümkün olduğunda ve onlar hepsi ne olup bittiğini anlıyor ve hiçbir yere gitmeyeceğimizi ve sadece bizimle işbirliği yapmaları gerektiğini düşünüyorlar, böylece küçük kardeşim j'nin büyük kardeşine takıntılı olduğunu biliyoruz, j'nin her akşam saatlerce dışarı çıkmasıyla ilgili bir sorunum vardı ve onu evde ve güvende tutmaya çalışırken çok stresliydim ama matt'in burada olması sorunu temelde ortadan kaldırdı, j sadece her zaman onun etrafında olmak istiyor ve matt bir şekilde bu çocuğun onunla ödev yapmanın şimdiye kadarki en iyi şey olduğunu düşünmesini sağladı

üzgünüm bu yine çok uzun oldu, bu güncellemeleri ne kadar süreyle yapmaya devam edeceğimi bilmiyorum ama şimdilik herkes inanılmaz derecede yardımsever, bu yüzden yazmaya devam edeceğim çünkü her zaman daha fazla tavsiyeye ihtiyacım oluyor

yorumlarda ve özel mesajlarda herkesin tavsiyesi ve desteği harika oldu ve aslında günlük hayatımızı daha iyi hale getirmemize yardımcı oldu, bu yüzden teşekkür ederim sm internet yabancıları"
"Im f18. When I was 12, my friend and I were sexually asaulted by my trainer. This went on for about a year and everything you can imagine happened before I managed to leave after a year. It's been bugging me ever since because he still trains little girls. I thought about taking him to court but I have no evidence. The only option I can think of is to call his wife and tell her (he has 3 kids with her and they are still together). What do you think?",ben arkadaşımken ve eğitmenim tarafından cinsel saldırıya uğradığımda bu yaklaşık bir yıl sürdü ve ben ayrılmayı başarana kadar hayal edebileceğiniz her şey oldu bir yıl sonra bu beni rahatsız etti çünkü hala küçük kızlara eğitim veriyor onu mahkemeye vermeyi düşündüm ama hiçbir kanıtım yok aklıma gelen tek seçenek karısını arayıp ona çocukları olduğunu ve hala birlikte olduklarını söylemek sen ne düşünüyorsun
"After being threatened to be uninvited from Thanksgiving at my aunt’s house for a few weeks now, it has finally happened. For context, I have spent every single Thanksgiving at my aunt’s house, including flying in from out of state during my college years. Politically, I have grown up generally left leaning, but my husband leans slightly to the right. Unlike me, my husband posts constantly on Facebook, and despite my wishes otherwise, he uses it as most would use a journal. He posts many podcasts and YouTube videos (most often Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan). A few weeks ago, he posted a podcast featuring Mike Bentz, and the subject matter as far as I understand it dealt with censorship. As she has done with many of his posts, my (extremely left leaning) aunt went on a commenting storm, but this one was even more insistent because Mike Bentz has a hidden past with white supremacy. I obviously don’t think it’s a good look, but my husband refused to take it down. This was several weeks ago, and while I don’t want to completely disregard Bentz’ past, the subject matter did not read white supremacy to me. My aunt made it clear he would not be welcomed if he continued to have it posted, and my husband felt he would be censored himself if he took it down. She has said she will be gracious if he asks for her forgiveness.
I am pregnant with my first child and I love my family, including my aunt. I want to be there with them so badly, but this chaotic back and forth between my aunt and husband has gone on for so long that I don’t see them resolving things before then. My sister has advised me to block my aunt, but I can’t bring myself to (my sister is also super left leaning, so this surprised me). My aunt is messaging me constantly about this issue, reminding me why he is wrong and that I am still invited, but I am not replying. How do I navigate this Thanksgiving day?

EDIT: I am overwhelmed by the responses, mostly in a good way! Thank you for everyone who took the time to read and consider; I will reply to as many comments as I am able to.

To address a few major concerns:
- For everyone who believes I am married to a far right mysogonist rascist homophobe: This is simply not true. My husband and I have gladly attended several lesbian/gay weddings. I hold many leadership positions in the work I do, and he supports me fully. He has even pointed out instances of racism to me when he has witnessed it. I’m not saying that the voices he has opted to listen to hav zero negative impact, but they simply do not reflect the core of who he is. While I may not agree with everything my husband says or posts, all of the non-negotiables have been sorted through, and I have no doubt our child will be raised in a living and supportive home. He is not a white supremacist (which I have told my aunt), and he and I have been talking through the implications of his social media activity.
- Blocking/unfollowing: I did not learn until mentioned below that posts can be shared to everyone except a certain few, so thank you for that. In any case, my husband wanted to keep lines open and continue to learn from my aunt and consider her points, yet she has seemed to belittle him for quite some time. After this “final straw,” he unfriended her.
- For those who claim I have no opinion/backbone: because my vocation is religious in nature, I prefer to keep politics separate from what I spend so much time doing. As such, I do not often practice vocalizing political opinions. I do, however, appreciate the push to vocalize the values that are crucial to speak up about.
LASTLY, MY THANKSGIVING PLAN: My mom is hosting a small Thanksgiving with my siblings, and I will be stopping by my aunt’s house briefly later in the day to drop off Christmas gifts. I would not have been able to sort through all of this without your input, so thank you all who were considerate, well wishing, and avoided making demeaning assumptions. Hoping everyone has a PEACEFUL Thanksgiving!","Birkaç haftadır teyzemin evinde Şükran Günü'ne davet edilmemekle tehdit edildikten sonra sonunda gerçekleşti bağlam açısından üniversite yıllarımda eyalet dışından uçarak geldiğim dahil her Şükran Günü'nü teyzemin evinde geçirdim politik olarak genel olarak sol görüşlü büyüdüm ama kocam benden farklı olarak hafifçe sağa eğilimli kocam sürekli Facebook'ta paylaşım yapıyor ve benim aksi yöndeki isteklerime rağmen çoğu kişinin günlük kullandığı gibi kullanıyor çoğunlukla birçok podcast ve youtube videosu paylaşıyor jordan peterson ve joe rogan birkaç hafta önce mike bentz'in yer aldığı bir podcast yayınladı ve konu anladığım kadarıyla sansürle ilgiliydi tıpkı birçok paylaşımında yaptığı gibi aşırı sol görüşlü teyzem yorum fırtınasına tutuldu ama bu daha da ısrarcıydı çünkü mike bentz'in beyaz üstünlüğüyle ilgili gizli bir geçmişi var açıkçası bunun iyi bir görüntü olmadığını düşünüyorum ama kocam bunu kaldırmayı reddetti bu birkaç hafta önceydi ve bentz'in geçmişini tamamen göz ardı etmek istemesem de konu bana beyaz üstünlüğüyle ilgili gelmedi teyzem bunu açıkça belirtti eğer yayınlamaya devam ederse hoş karşılanmayacak ve kocam bunu kaldırırsa kendisi sansürlenecek diye düşündü eğer ondan af dilerse nazik davranacağını söyledi
ilk çocuğuma hamileyim ve teyzem de dahil olmak üzere ailemi seviyorum onlarla birlikte olmak istiyorum ama teyzemle kocam arasındaki bu kaotik gidip gelme o kadar uzun sürdü ki aralarındaki sorunları çözmeden önce göremiyorum kız kardeşim teyzemi engellememi tavsiye etti ama kendimi ona getiremiyorum kız kardeşim de aşırı sol görüşlü bu yüzden bu beni şaşırttı teyzem bana bu konu hakkında sürekli mesaj atıyor neden yanıldığını ve hala davetli olduğumu hatırlatıyor ama cevap vermiyorum bu şükran gününde nasıl idare edebilirim

düzenleme çoğunlukla iyi yönde gelen yanıtlar karşısında şaşkına döndüm okumaya ve değerlendirmeye zaman ayıran herkese teşekkür ederim elimden geldiğince çok yoruma cevap vereceğim

birkaç önemli endişeyi gidermek için
aşırı sağcı bir kadın düşmanı ırkçı homofobikle evli olduğuma inanan herkes için bu kesinlikle doğru değil kocam ve ben memnuniyetle birçok lezbiyen-gay düğününe katıldım, yaptığım işte birçok liderlik pozisyonundayım ve o da beni tam olarak destekliyor, hatta şahit olduğunda bana ırkçılık örneklerini bile gösterdi, dinlemeyi seçtiği seslerin sıfır olumsuz etkisi olduğunu söylemiyorum, ancak bunlar onun özünü yansıtmıyor, kocamın söylediği veya paylaştığı her şeye katılmasam da, pazarlık konusu olmayan tüm konular çözüldü ve çocuğumuzun yaşayan ve destekleyici bir evde yetiştirileceğinden şüphem yok, beyaz üstünlükçü değil, bunu teyzeme söyledim ve o ve ben onun sosyal medya aktivitesinin etkileri hakkında konuşuyoruz
engellemetakibi bırakmaaşağıda belirtilene kadar gönderilerin belirli birkaç kişi dışında herkesle paylaşılabileceğini öğrenmemiştim, bu yüzden bunun için teşekkür ederim, her durumda kocam hatları açık tutmak ve teyzemden öğrenmeye devam etmek ve onun görüşlerini dikkate almak istedi, ancak bu son bardağı taşıran son damladan sonra onu bir süre küçümsemiş gibi görünüyor, onu arkadaşlıktan çıkardı
fikrim olmadığını iddia edenler içinbackbone çünkü mesleğim doğası gereği dinidir, tercih ederim siyaseti çok fazla zaman harcadığım şeyden ayrı tutmak için, siyasi görüşlerimi dile getirmeyi pek sık yapmam ancak konuşulması gereken değerleri dile getirme çabasını takdir ediyorum
son olarak şükran günü planım annem kardeşlerimle küçük bir şükran günü partisi düzenliyor ve günün ilerleyen saatlerinde teyzemin evine uğrayıp Noel hediyelerini bırakacağım sizin girdiniz olmadan tüm bunları halledemezdim bu yüzden düşünceli, iyi dileklerde bulunan ve aşağılayıcı varsayımlarda bulunmaktan kaçınan herkese teşekkür ederim umarım herkes huzurlu bir şükran günü geçirir"
"I (24F) am currently 24 weeks pregnant with a girl. Although she was an unexpected surprise, my partner (24M) and I are ecstatic and look forward to parenthood. I lost my mama when I was young so we are planning to name this baby after her &lt;3  
Most of my family and friends have been really support of me and my pregnancy as I enter this new stage of life. However, my cousin and my aunt, who acted (or at least tried to) as a mother figure and a female role model to me and my sister since my mother's passing, have been causing issues.  
My cousin (31F) has been struggling with infertility for about 5 years now and has witnessed its ups and downs. Me, my sister, and all of our family members have been trying our best to be sensitive to her circumstances and have been supporting her through the process. She had a miscarriage 5 years ago and was diagnosed with having a diminished ovarian reserve 2 years ago, meaning that her egg quantity and quality are considerably lower compared to other women her age. She immediately started the IVF process and after 2 rounds, she miraculously got pregnant late 2022.  She had complications with the pregnancy, including preeclampsia, and went into labor at 30+2 weeks in the summer. Unfortunately, her baby girl was very weak at birth and died hours after she was born.  
Everything my cousin has struggled with over the past 5 years hit her hard and she suffered from an extreme depression for months afterwards. She has refused to seek therapy, which we believe would be beneficial to her state, apart from a couple of appointments initially because she says she feels ""misunderstood"" and ""anger"" towards the professionals trying to make her feel better. She still desperately wants a baby, but refuses to seek treatments again due to trauma and a lack of hope.  
I hope this context helps y'all understand the situation I'm going to talk about and if applicable, provide any advice to help us guide our cousin to some sense of recovery.  
After finding out about my pregnancy, I announced it to my family and friends in February. I made sure to text/tell my cousin individually before she heard about my pregnancy elsewhere so she can initially process the news herself privately. According to my other cousins and aunt, she did not take the news well and went into a rage. When I saw her afterwards she was more reserved and rather cold. A week later, she said she wanted hang out and have a private one-to-one chat, which I agreed to.  
We talked over ice cream and went back to her and her husband's home. She showed me her baby stuff that had been untouched for months since her loss. She told me she saw so much of the baby she lost last year in my own baby and how god brought my baby into our lives for a special reason. She asked me if I'd be willing to allow her to adopt this baby into her home to be raised by her and her husband. I refused. She asked why. For a lack of a better and stronger response in the moment, I said that both me and my partner wanted to care for our child and that I was sorry for her loss and that I was sure a miracle would come her way.  
She blew up at me and called me a bunch of names. I knew she was struggled and very traumatized so I tried not to let her words of the moment get to me. She said how me and my partner didn't deserve our baby because we weren't married yet (we are engaged and planning the wedding for next year) and how she and her husband could provide our baby with a better and more stable life as more deserving and ""respectable"" parents. She then kicked me out.  
My aunt later texted and called me trying to ""reason"" with me on my refusal. She said I should give my baby to her daughter. She emphasized that I would still get to see her as she would be within the family, and that I could have more kids later on as I was still young. She said that babies were more than fun little humans and that based on her experience ""nurturing"" me, I wasn't ready yet. She continued with this pressure and guilt trip.  
She apparently gave out my number to her other relatives and friends at church. They have also been texting me and urging that I be more sympathetic to my cousin and her situation. My relatives were more chill, but, her church friends were saying terrible and demeaning things about me that I blocked them.  
I try to avoid my aunt and my cousin as much as I possible can. I want to be there for my cousin, but it's becoming really difficult. My aunt has been trying to dictate my life and choices as my only ""motherly figure"" since I was a child and she won't stop. I found out my cousin has been telling people that she is soon getting a baby and that her life will be complete again. They think I'll come around and be overwhelmed once I face the realities of parenthood. This is all just so crazy and frightening to me.  
If you have any advice or just ways to de-stress in general, please let me know.

"Me and my girlfriend had been dating for 10 months, we had a loving relationship but I wasn’t in it and broke up with her. During our relationship she confided in me that she was raped by this man when she was 16. She also had consensual. sex with him a month later, and hooked up with him one last time a week before we started dating. She cried to me so much about this man, and talked about how much it changed her. Fast forward to tonight, I get a call from a friend who knows about this guy and says that they both are at this party he’s at. I heard that she let him in, and then she had sex with him, afterwards the guy runs away, and she appears as if she doesn’t know at all what happened. Then I came to give her a ride, because despite us breaking up I still felt an obligation to be there for her and give her a ride. While she’s in my car she doesn’t say a word to me, and it felt as if she was pretending to be drunk. I remember her first seeing my car and saying “Oh Hell No.” Then saying “This uber looks my boyfriends car”, “We’re in his car!?”, “I love this Taxi” and it really felt like she was faking it. I drop her off with her friend and she doesn’t say anything to me. That is the whole story, I’m so confused what to think, did she get raped? Please help me wrap my head around this and i’m here to answer any questions.

Edit 1 : More facts to the story, She invited him and let him in, but before inviting told my friend to never let this guy in, so weird. I havnt talked to her since and don’t plan on reaching out again. I went to pick her up because at one point all I knew was “My ex is at a party with her rapist” and I thought I knew how scared she would be, so I hopped in the car immediately.","kız arkadaşımla aylardır çıkıyorduk, sevgi dolu bir ilişkimiz vardı ama ben ilişkimizde değildim ve ilişkimiz sırasında ondan ayrıldım, bana bu adam tarafından tecavüze uğradığını söyledi, bir ay sonra onunla rızasıyla seks yaptı ve çıkmaya başlamadan bir hafta önce son kez birlikte oldu, bana bu adam hakkında çok ağladı ve bunun onu ne kadar değiştirdiğinden bahsetti, bu geceye hızlıca ilerledim, bu adamı tanıyan bir arkadaşım aradı ve ikisinin de onun gittiği bir partide olduğunu söyledi, adamın onu içeri aldığını ve sonra onunla seks yaptığını duydum, adam kaçıyor ve kadın olan biteni hiç bilmiyormuş gibi görünüyor, sonra onu arabayla bırakmaya gittim çünkü ayrılmamıza rağmen hala onun için orada olma ve arabamdayken onu arabayla bırakma yükümlülüğüm olduğunu hissettim, bana tek kelime etmedi ve sanki sarhoşmuş gibi hissettim, arabamı ilk gördüğünde ah hayır dediğini ve sonra bu Uber'in erkek arkadaşımın arabasına baktığını söylediğini hatırlıyorum, erkek arkadaşımın arabasındaydı, bu taksiyi seviyorum ve gerçekten numara yapıyormuş gibi hissettim onu arkadaşına bıraktım ve bana hiçbir şey söylemedi tüm hikaye bu çok kafam karıştı ne düşüneceğim tecavüze mi uğradı lütfen kafamı toparlamama yardım edin ve sorularınızı cevaplamak için buradayım

hikayenin daha fazla bilgisini düzenleyin onu davet etti ve içeri aldı ama davet etmeden önce arkadaşıma bu adamı asla içeri almamasını söyledi çok garip o zamandan beri onunla konuşmadım ve tekrar iletişime geçmeyi planlamıyorum onu ​​almaya gittim çünkü bir noktada bildiğim tek şey eski sevgilimin tecavüzcüsüyle bir partide olduğuydu ve ne kadar korkacağını bildiğimi düşündüm bu yüzden hemen arabaya atladım"
"UPDATE: I dumped him. 
His loss because I do love some BDSM but he ain’t ever getting any of that from me! 

My boyfriend ‘28M’ watches a lot of porn and recently, the sexual acts he wants me ‘30F’ to perform is a reflection of the porn he watches. 

This might be graphic but he loves it when I get on my knees while he takes his “you know what” and slaps me on the face. He is insanely in love with rim jobs and wants me to perform them almost every time we have sex. Though, I’m not a fan of being lightly slapped in the face with his junk and rim jobs, I’m ok with doing it once in a while. 

Recently, I told him how I feel. I feel lesser as a person and made it clear that I don’t like performing certain acts all the time. Not shocking, he called me vanilla. Just an fyi, I love toys but he feels inadequate if I have him use them. Also, I’m a submissive type but there’s a line that I feel has been crossed. Finally, I don’t judge anyone for their preferences! 

I’m not sure how to handle this situation. It became obvious that he’s taking porn too seriously.

Should I tell him to reduce his porn intake? 

","güncelleme onu terk ettim
kaybı çünkü ben bdsm'i seviyorum ama o benden hiçbirini alamıyor

erkek arkadaşım çok fazla porno izliyor ve son zamanlarda benden yapmamı istediği cinsel hareketler izlediği pornonun bir yansıması

bu biraz açıklayıcı olabilir ama dizlerimin üzerine çöküp o da ne olduğunu biliyor musun ne yaptığını ve yüzüme tokat attığını görünce çok seviyor, rimjob'lara deli gibi aşık ve neredeyse her seks yaptığımızda bunları yapmamı istiyor ama ben onun kıçına ve rimjob'larına hafifçe tokat atılmasından hoşlanmıyorum arada sırada yapmaktan da memnunum

son zamanlarda ona nasıl hissettiğimi söyledim, bir insan olarak kendimi değersiz hissediyorum ve her zaman belirli hareketleri yapmaktan hoşlanmadığımı açıkça belirttim, şaşırtıcı değil, bana vanilya dedi, sadece bilgi amaçlı oyuncakları seviyorum ama onları kullanmasını istediğimde yetersiz hissediyor ayrıca itaatkar bir tipim ama sonunda kimseyi tercihleri ​​için yargılamıyorum

bu durumla nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum pornoyu çok ciddiye aldığı aşikar

ona porno tüketimini azaltmasını söylemeli miyim"
"So to set the scene last week my wife wasn't feeling hot and lost her sense of taste. She took a COVID test and had a positive result. 

Recently, I have kept my daughter home from school for 2 days due to sickness. I gave her 2 COVID tests and both came back negative but she was not well enough to go. I took dependant leave from work to look after her as my wife works night shifts and needed to sleep.

This Saturday we were scheduled to go to Harry Potter World (the place with the sets) and it was something she and my daughter were both really looking forward too.

However, I started to not feel great and it progressively got worse throughout the day. About an hour ago I took a COVID test as I wanted to be sure and it came back with a positive result.

Current NHS advice (UK resident here) says that you need to stay at home for 5 days if you're an adult.

To say this released a torrent of anger from my wife is an understatement. She started crying and blaming me for taking the test. She kept screaming ""WHY DID YOU TAKE THE TEST??? WE WERE THIS CLOSE TO GOING??? WHY???"" She was really looking forward to this as was my daughter (although the former is the bigger harry potter fan). We had to reschedule this once before as well due to a mix up.

I explained to her that my symptoms felt like they were getting worse and I wanted to know before going so as not to risk anyone. Our family friend is also going and is the ticket holder. I was going to drive us all there. She started saying that ""everyone is vaccinated now"" and ""you don't have to legally take a test anymore"" and she's technically correct but that just made me question why she took one last week and now has the gall to tell me I shouldn't have taken it just because we were so close to going on our trip.

Honestly, the level of guilt tripping on display got me so angry on a level I've never felt before. Being blamed for trying to do the right thing felt like such a betrayal from her of all people. On one hand I get it. She was super excited to go and this might have utterly ruined that for her but at the same time I felt like I was being blamed for catching the god damn virus or for deliberately not trying to play ignorant and ignore it.

This level of hostility and blame has honestly left me shaken to my core when thinking about our marriage. We've had fights before like all couples do but this cut deep.

Should I have just ignored the symptoms and not taken the test? Am I truly the dickhead here for doing it 2 days before going on a trip? Or is here blaming me for this just a level of hypocrisy because it affected her directly? I honestly don't know where I stand at this point as I'm still emotionally reeling but I want to get someone else's opinion here.


UPDATE

Well this blew up bigger than I thought it would. Thanks for all the responses everyone.
Just giving you all an update on this. Wife apologised quite thoroughly. Think she quickly realised what she said was not ok and cooler heads prevailed in the end. My friend has agreed to take both her and my daughter to Harry Potter World so I'm gonna owe him big for that.
Im thinking of the couples counselling that some of you suggested to nip this crap in the bud so it doesn't happen again. I'll bring it up after they are back though.","yani sahneyi hazırlamak için geçen hafta karım kendini iyi hissetmiyordu ve tat alma duyusunu kaybetti, bir covid testi yaptırdı ve pozitif çıktı

son zamanlarda kızımı hastalık nedeniyle günlerce okuldan uzak tuttum, ona covid testleri yaptırdım ve ikisi de negatif çıktı ama gidecek kadar iyi değildi, karım gece vardiyasında çalıştığı ve uyuması gerektiği için ona bakmak için işten izin aldım

bu cumartesi günü Harry Potter World'e, setlerin olduğu yere gitmeyi planlamıştık ve bu hem onun hem de kızımın gerçekten dört gözle beklediği bir şeydi

ancak kendimi iyi hissetmemeye başladım ve gün içinde giderek kötüleşti, yaklaşık bir saat önce emin olmak istediğim için bir covid testi yaptırdım ve pozitif çıktı

buradaki şu anki NHS tavsiyesi, İngiltere'de ikamet eden bir kişi yetişkinseniz günlerce evde kalmanız gerektiğini söylüyor

bunu söylemek karımın öfkesini açığa çıkarır, ağlamaya başladı ve testi yaptırdığım için beni suçladı, neden testi yaptırdın diye bağırmaya devam etti, gitmeye bu kadar yakındık kızım da harry potter hayranı olmasına rağmen bunu daha önce bir kez daha ertelemek zorunda kalmamıza rağmen neden gerçekten dört gözle beklediğini anlattım

ona semptomlarımın kötüleştiğini hissettiğimi ve gitmeden önce bunu bilmek istediğimi, böylece kimseyi riske atmamak istediğimi anlattım, aile dostumuz da gidiyor ve bilet sahibi, hepimizi oraya ben götürecektim, herkesin aşılandığını ve artık yasal olarak test yaptırmanıza gerek olmadığını söylemeye başladı ve teknik olarak haklıydı ama bu sadece geçen hafta bir test yaptırıp şimdi bana sadece seyahatimize çok yakın olduğumuz için yaptırmamam gerektiğini söyleme cüretini göstermesini sorgulamama neden oldu

dürüst olmak gerekirse sergilenen suçluluk duygusu beni daha önce hiç hissetmediğim bir seviyede çok kızdırdı, doğru şeyi yapmaya çalıştığım için suçlanmak onun için bir ihanet gibiydi, bir yandan gitmek için çok heyecanlı olduğunu anlıyorum ve bu onun için her şeyi mahvetmiş olabilir ama aynı zamanda lanet virüsü kaptığım için veya kasıtlı olarak cahil gibi davranmaya ve görmezden gelmeye çalışmıyorum

bu düzeydeki düşmanlık ve suçlama, dürüst olmak gerekirse evliliğimizi düşündüğümde beni derinden sarstı, tüm çiftlerin yaptığı gibi daha önce kavgalarımız oldu ama bu derinden etkiledi

sadece semptomları görmezden gelip testi yaptırmamalı mıydım? Seyahate çıkmadan günler önce bunu yaptığım için gerçekten aptal mıyım yoksa beni bunun için mi suçluyorsunuz? Sadece onu doğrudan etkilediği için bir ikiyüzlülük seviyesi dürüst olmak gerekirse bu noktada nerede durduğumu bilmiyorum çünkü hala duygusal olarak sarsılmış durumdayım ama burada başka birinin fikrini almak istiyorum

güncelleme

bu düşündüğümden daha büyük bir patlama oldu, herkese tüm yanıtlar için teşekkürler
sadece bu konuda hepinize bir güncelleme veriyorum, karısı oldukça özür diledi, söylediklerinin doğru olmadığını hemen fark ettiğini düşünüyorum ve sonunda daha sakin kafalar galip geldi arkadaşım hem onu ​​hem de kızımı Harry Potter dünyasına götürmeyi kabul etti, bu yüzden ona bunun için çok şey borçlu olacağım
bazılarınızın bu saçmalığı kökünden bitirmek için önerdiği çift terapisini düşünüyorum, böylece bir daha olmaz, sonra gündeme getireceğim ama geri döndüler"
"i (22F) met this man (25M) on hinge and we hit it off through text. On our first date I noticed that he had a very feminine voice and vocabulary (just like one you would hear in the gay community). He was very sweet and showed a lot of interest in me so I looked past it and we have been on 2 more dates since! It really fades in the background and i don’t even notice it now, however, when we were out at dinner the topic of everyone thinking that he was gay came up. He told me that every time he meets new people and they find out that he likes women they are surprised and tell him that they thought he was gay. He shared with me that it’s something that has bothered him in the past because he doesn’t know why people think that. I honestly was very caught off guard when he brought it up that i couldn’t bring myself to share with him that it’s his voice and vocabulary. 

I talked to my mom about it and she said she thinks i should tell him so that he is aware but I honestly don’t think it would be helpful as it isn’t something that he can change… what would you do/want to be done in this situation?","bu adamla tanıştım ve ilk buluşmamızda mesajlaşarak anlaştık, tıpkı eşcinsel toplulukta duyabileceğiniz gibi çok kadınsı bir ses tonu ve kelime dağarcığı olduğunu fark ettim, çok tatlıydı ve bana çok ilgi gösterdi, bu yüzden bunu görmezden geldim ve arka planda gerçekten kaybolduğundan beri daha fazla buluşmaya çıktık ve artık farkına bile varmıyorum, ancak akşam yemeğinde olduğumuzda herkesin onun eşcinsel olduğunu düşünmesi konusu açıldı, bana her yeni insanla tanıştığında ve onun kadınlardan hoşlandığını öğrendiklerinde şaşırdıklarını ve ona eşcinsel olduğunu düşündüklerini söylediklerini söyledi, bunun geçmişte onu rahatsız eden bir şey olduğunu söyledi çünkü insanların neden böyle düşündüğünü bilmiyor, dürüst olmak gerekirse bunu gündeme getirdiğinde çok hazırlıksız yakalandım, onunla paylaşmaya kendimi getiremedim, bunun sesi ve kelime dağarcığı olduğunu söyledi

annemle bu konuyu konuştum ve bana söylemem gerektiğini söyledi, böylece farkında olsun ama dürüst olmak gerekirse bunun yardımcı olacağını düşünmüyorum çünkü bu onun değiştirebileceği bir şey değil, bu durumda ne yapılmasını isterdin"
"Okay so this started happening a few weeks ago but escalated last night. So a few weeks ago my (27f) daughter (10f) asked to borrow one of my candles for decoration. I allowed it but she was NOT allowed to light the candle under any circumstances it was strictly for decor

A week ago I noticed a few small blue spots on her carpet. I questioned her about it and she told me she accidently dripped her drink when bringing it to her desk which I bought at the time

A few nights ago while washing her bedsheets I noticed more spots. They were again blue and when I questioned her again she told me she also got some of her drink on her bed which seemed odd to me because she never really drinks any colored liquids but I hadn't put two and two together yet. She does eat those colored frozen pop things so I figured it must have been that

Last night I left her alone for an hour to run to the store and when I got back she was acting weird. I noticed she had showered which she never does at night so I went into her bathroom and found dried blue candle wax all over the floor and the sink. I immediately searched her room and confiscated the candle and asked her how she lit it. She said she didn't light it but clearly she's lying

Obviously all candles are removed from the house until I find out exactly how she lit the candle and can trust her again

What would be an appropriate punishment and how exactly do you think she lit the candle in the first place. I don't have matches anywhere in the house and the one lighter I do have is locked away in my bedroom which she could not get to

  
UPDATE

  
Wow this post really took off so I have an update.

I obviously know she was playing with the wax so I sat her down and asked her why. I asked if she was trying to wax her legs like some of you suggested and she said no. I told her it's okay she can tell me anything and she said she just liked the way it felt

I asked her how she lit the candle and she said she used the stove

I'm not going to ground her because she was honest with me. I warned her about the potential risk of starting a fire. I also warned her about potentially burning herself if she got more than she intended on herself

Were going to watch a fire safety show together and she is going to help me clean the carpet and the bed and bed post where the majority of the wax had dried up

Once we are finished cleaning the mess she made I am going to reward her with an LED candle set

Thanks everyone","tamam bu birkaç hafta önce olmaya başladı ama dün gece daha da arttı bu yüzden birkaç hafta önce kızım f dekorasyon için mumlarımdan birini ödünç istedi izin verdim ama hiçbir koşulda mumu yakmasına izin verilmedi bu tamamen dekorasyon amaçlıydı

bir hafta önce halısında birkaç küçük mavi nokta fark ettim ve ona bu konuda soru sordum ve bana o sırada satın aldığım içkisini masasına getirirken yanlışlıkla damlattığını söyledi

birkaç gece önce çarşaflarını yıkarken daha fazla nokta fark ettim yine maviydiler ve ona tekrar soru sorduğumda bana yatağına da biraz içki döktüğünü söyledi ki bu bana garip geldi çünkü o asla renkli sıvılar içmez ama henüz iki ve ikiyi bir araya getirmemiştim o renkli dondurulmuş gazlı içecekleri yiyor bu yüzden bunun bu olduğunu düşündüm

dün gece onu bir saat yalnız bıraktım ve markete gittim ve geri döndüğümde garip davranıyordu duş aldığını fark ettim ki geceleri asla yapmaz bu yüzden banyosuna gittim ve yerde ve lavaboda kurumuş mavi mum mumu buldum hemen odasını aradım ve mumu aldı ve nasıl yaktığını sordu, mumu yakmadığını söyledi ama açıkça yalan söylüyor

açıkçası mumu nasıl yaktığını öğrenene ve ona tekrar güvenebilene kadar tüm mumlar evden kaldırılır

uygun bir ceza ne olurdu ve ilk başta mumu tam olarak nasıl yaktığını düşünüyorsun evde hiçbir yerde kibrit yok ve sahip olduğum tek çakmak yatak odamda kilitli ve ona ulaşamadı

güncelleme

vay canına bu gönderi gerçekten ilgi gördü, bu yüzden bir güncellemem var

açıkçası mumla oynadığını biliyordum, bu yüzden onu oturttum ve neden bacaklarını ağdalamaya çalıştığını sordum, bazılarınız gibi önerdi ve hayır dedi, ona sorun olmadığını, bana her şeyi anlatabileceğini söyledim ve sadece hissettirdiği şekilden hoşlandığını söyledi

ona mumu nasıl yaktığını sordum ve soba kullandığını söyledi

ona ceza vermeyeceğim çünkü bana karşı dürüsttü, onu yangın çıkarma potansiyel riski konusunda uyardım, ayrıca kendisine amaçladığından fazlasını alırsa kendini yakma potansiyeli konusunda uyardım

yapacaktık birlikte bir yangın güvenliği şovu izleyeceğim ve o bana halıyı, yatağı ve yatak direğini temizlememde yardım edecek, mumun çoğu orada kurumuştu

ortaya çıkardığı pisliği temizlemeyi bitirdiğimizde onu bir led mum seti ile ödüllendireceğim

herkese teşekkürler"
"UPDATE

So basically like some of you told me I went to see him. Basically I pulled him into a tight hug and told him how much I love him and that he means the world to me and that nothing could change that, ever. I told him I can wait as much as he needs if he has something to say, but that he must know that he can tell me anything. After a few secs he told me he was ready to tell me.

Basically the mf is I quote ""probably gay"". i have no clue how he could've though I would hate him or sum because of it????? I asked him why tf he even thought I would hate him and he admitted it was kind of an irrational fear. I told him I love him no matter what and that i just want him to be happy. Like sure it was big news because he doesn't fit the cliché at all and there were no giveaways but like who am I to give af and to judge him? Then he begged me not to tell anyone (the pure despair in his eyes was too much bro) and I was like bro why do you even ask lol.

Ngl I told him I'm a bt pissed because I've been so anxious and worried like I thought he had a dismembered body in his backpack or sum but it was 'just' that. Ofc I told him I was super proud of him for telling me and for being honest to himself and that I'll have his back always. By then the mood was very chill so we continued talking abbout it. Basically he's got no bf cause he's been figuring things out and he realized he's not straight and it freaked him out a lot, he thought we would all reject him etc. 

Honestly idk how our folks will react (dad will prob be mad yikes) but i have no beef at all with being gay and I'll stand by his side and yeah I just love him yeah. Thanks everyone for your support and it definitely went better than I expected lol.","güncelleme

yani temelde bazılarınızın bana söylediği gibi onu görmeye gittim, onu sıkıca sarıldım ve ona onu ne kadar sevdiğimi ve benim için dünyalar anlamına geldiğini ve hiçbir şeyin bunu değiştiremeyeceğini söyledim, eğer söyleyecek bir şeyi varsa istediği kadar bekleyebileceğimi söyledim ama bana her şeyi anlatabileceğini bilmesi gerektiğini söyledi, birkaç saniye sonra bana anlatmaya hazır olduğunu söyledi

temelde erkek arkadaş muhtemelen eşcinsel, nasıl ondan nefret edebileceğimi veya bir şey düşünebildiğini bilmiyorum, neden ondan nefret edeceğimi düşündüğünü sordum ve bunun biraz mantıksız bir korku olduğunu kabul etti, ona ne olursa olsun onu sevdiğimi ve sadece mutlu olmasını istediğimi söyledim, kesinlikle büyük bir haberdi çünkü klişeye uymuyordu ve hiçbir ipucu yoktu ama ben kimim ki onu yargılayayım ve ona bir şey vereyim sonra kimseye söylememem için yalvardı, gözlerindeki saf çaresizlik çok fazlaydı dostum ve ben de dostum neden soruyorsun ki dedim lol

ngl ona bt olduğumu söyledim sinirliydim çünkü çok endişeliydim ve sırt çantasında parçalanmış bir beden olduğunu düşünüyordum ama tabii ki ona bana söylediği ve kendisine karşı dürüst olduğu için onunla çok gurur duyduğumu ve her zaman onu destekleyeceğimi söyledim o zamana kadar ruh hali çok rahattı bu yüzden konuşmaya devam ettik temelde erkek arkadaşı yok çünkü her şeyi çözmeye çalışıyordu ve heteroseksüel olmadığını fark etti ve bu onu çok korkuttu hepimizin onu reddedeceğini düşündü vs.

dürüst olmak gerekirse ailemizin nasıl tepki vereceğini bilmiyorum babam muhtemelen çok kızacak ama eşcinsel olmakla ilgili hiçbir sorunum yok ve onun yanında duracağım ve evet onu seviyorum evet desteğiniz için hepinize teşekkür ederim ve kesinlikle beklediğimden daha iyi geçti lol"
"I’ve only just broke up with him in the last three weeks. Please see my profile if you want the story.  Alex my ex and I have had no contact since the morning after the attack. He’s currently going through the legal process as a consequence of his actions. I gave my wedding dress and shoes to my own best friend  Milly to sell or donate or just get rid of. She has lots of sellers accounts on different platforms as she buys and resells collectibles a lot. She put my wedding dress veil shoes and other accessories up for sale with a view to me getting some money back. Cancelling the wedding meant  me losing a lot of money . 

Anyway it all sold immediately at a really great price and when Milly looked at the buyers info it’s my exes fathers business account. 

We are assuming it’s Alex my ex who bought them and not his father. Milly wanted to know what I wanted her to do. Does she pack up the stuff and send it to him or do I want to confront him? 
I asked Milly if she could cancel the purchase and she is checking that out but even if that is possible I wouldn’t want it to damage her sellers rating online. 

I am unsure why he would do this. I know he still wants us to get back together but that is never happening. Should I just let the sale go through and ignore it? It feels weird and upsetting. I feel like he is still torturing me and this is just a way of getting my attention and I have had zero interaction with him . Any advice welcome. 

EDIT Alex knows Millys selling accounts. He even bought stuff from her in the past. He hasn’t ever seen the wedding dress or any of my stuff we are assuming he knows it’s my wedding clothes  on Millys account. ","son üç haftadır ondan ayrıldım lütfen hikayeyi istiyorsanız profilimde bakın alex eski sevgilim ve ben saldırıdan sonraki sabahtan beri hiç iletişim kurmadık şu anda eylemlerinin bir sonucu olarak yasal süreçten geçiyor gelinliğimi ve ayakkabılarımı satmak, bağışlamak veya kurtulmak için en yakın arkadaşım milly'ye verdim farklı platformlarda çok sayıda satıcı hesabı var koleksiyonluk eşyaları alıp satıyor gelinliğimi, duvak ayakkabılarımı ve diğer aksesuarlarımı bana biraz para iadesi almak için satışa çıkardı düğünü iptal etmek çok para kaybetmeme neden oldu 

neyse, hepsi hemen gerçekten harika bir fiyata satıldı ve milly alıcı bilgilerine baktığında eski sevgilimin babasının iş hesabı olduğunu gördü 

bunları satın alanın eski sevgilim alex olduğunu ve babasının olmadığını varsayıyoruz milly ne yapmasını istediğimi bilmek istedi eşyaları toplayıp ona mı gönderecek yoksa onunla yüzleşmek mi istiyorum 
milly'ye satın alma işlemini iptal edip edemeyeceğini sordum ve bunu kontrol ediyor ama mümkün olsa bile ona zarar vermesini istemem satıcıların çevrimiçi değerlendirmesi 

bunu neden yaptığından emin değilim, hala tekrar bir araya gelmemizi istediğini biliyorum ama bu asla gerçekleşmiyor, satışı devam ettirip görmezden mi gelmeliyim, garip ve üzücü geliyor, bana hala işkence ediyormuş gibi hissediyorum ve bu sadece dikkatimi çekmenin bir yolu ve onunla hiçbir etkileşimim olmadı, herhangi bir tavsiyeye açığım

"so today my friends told me that about 2/3 months ago they were on among us and a man said they like them young and stuff like that.

he removed everyone in the game expect from one of my friends and said she was the perfect age for him and stuff and he got her address.
he then put his Snapchat in the chat and for some fucking reason she decided to add him 

there was a group chat with two of my friends and the man (I did not know any of this was happening, not a clue I was literally sleeping during this)
anyways they decided to send a picture of me claiming it was a bad photo they took ages ago so it didn’t matter

he then got my address and sent it to them.
I’m mad at them for doing this but they keep saying I’m being dramatic and he’s probably some 15 yr trying to scare people

I am still a minor. and by the fact that he got their address from an un signed in among accounts should be a sign to not add him anywhere else.

am I being dramatic and what should I say to them, I also have anxiety about this sort of thing and they know that I am not for shit like online dating and creepy shit.

what should I say to them
","bugün arkadaşlarım bana aylar önce Among Us'ta olduklarını ve bir adamın gençken onları sevdiğini ve bunun gibi şeyler söylediğini söyledi

arkadaşlarımdan biri hariç oyundaki herkesi sildi ve onun için mükemmel yaşta olduğunu ve bunun gibi şeyler söyledi ve onun adresini aldı
sonra snapchat'ini sohbete koydu ve nedense onu eklemeye karar verdi

iki arkadaşımla bir grup sohbeti vardı ve adam bunların hiçbirinin olduğunu bilmiyordum, hiçbir fikrim yoktu, bu sırada tam anlamıyla uyuyordum
neyse, çok uzun zaman önce çekilmiş kötü bir fotoğraf olduğunu iddia ederek bir fotoğrafımı göndermeye karar verdiler, bu yüzden önemli değildi

sonra adresimi aldı ve onlara gönderdi
bunu yaptıkları için onlara kızgınım ama onlar benim dramatik davrandığımı ve muhtemelen bir yıldır insanları korkutmaya çalıştığını söylüyorlar

ben hala küçüğüm ve onun adresini oturum açmamış bir Among Account'tan almış olması onu başka hiçbir yere eklememesi için bir işaret olmalı

dramatik mi davranıyorum ve onlara ne söylemeliyim ben de bu tür şeyler konusunda endişeliyim ve onlar benim hiçbir şey yapmadığımı biliyorlar çevrimiçi flört ve ürkütücü şeyler gibi

onlara ne söylemeliyim"
"I need the people who are dating someone who has a child to speak up in these comments. 

I’ll make a long story short. I have a son that is 11 years old and his mom is not in the picture at all. I mean AT ALL. He doesn’t know his mom and has never met her. She is a junky and on the streets in another state. That’s another story in itself but everyone has tried getting her to get clean and she has burned every bridge. She has never cared about our son and shortly after he was born, she went off the deep end got on drugs and was doing other criminal activities.

Anyways, few girlfriends have met my son. Three total have met him and were in his life. I tried to be careful about bringing women into his life cause I didn’t want to cause further mental health issues if the women didn’t work out with me. Thankfully, he doesn’t remember the first two gfs since he was so young.

Fast forward to a year and a half ago, when I met my (now wife) Charity, I fell head over heels for her. She is amazing in every way. Beautiful, kind, thoughtful, funny and more. I knew she was something special. When I had her and my son meet, she was so kind and nurturing to him! I wanted to make sure my son liked her too, and he adores her. I’ll skip the unnecessary details of our relationship to about 8 months ago when I asked her to marry me. She said yes and we were engaged..

Something started to change.. she would start to say horrible things to me in private. About how she feels like a “loser” for being engaged to someone with a kid. How she has to now deal with this boy that “she didn’t even make”. These things started out smaller and started growing to more frequently AND more harsh and hurtful. The crazy thing is. She was very kind and sweet to my son! She never said a bad thing to him at all. So my head was all mixed up on how to handle how my fiancé hated the fact that I had my son.. she would tell me she wishes that I didn’t have a son because then I’d be perfect. Asks me things like “do you ever wish you didn’t have your son with that junky?” 

The worst part is, none of my family knows about what she says. I wanted to protect her character in their eyes. I knew if I told someone, they would tell me that isn’t right and maybe we shouldn’t get married. So I kept it a secret. We are now married and it hasn’t stopped. I thought maybe if we got married, the deal would be done and it would be pointless for her to complain about my son. Stupid wishful thinking.. 😞

This was a long post but I hope the people who are dating/married to someone with a child can let me know if you ever have similar feelings towards your partners child(that isn’t yours)? Have you ever said anything like this? Perhaps she is jealous about it? ","Çocuğu olan biriyle çıkan kişilerin bu yorumlarda konuşmasını istiyorum

Uzun hikayeyi kısa keseceğim, yaşında bir oğlum var ve annesi hiç yok, yani hiç, annesini tanımıyor ve hiç tanışmamış, uyuşturucu bağımlısı ve başka bir eyalette sokaklarda, bu kendi başına başka bir hikaye ama herkes onu temizlemeye çalıştı ve her köprüyü yaktı, oğlumuzla hiç ilgilenmedi ve doğduktan kısa bir süre sonra aşırıya kaçtı, uyuşturucuya başladı ve başka suç faaliyetlerinde bulundu

Neyse, oğlumla tanışan birkaç kız arkadaş var, toplamda üç kişi, onunla tanıştım ve hayatındaydı, hayatına kadın sokma konusunda dikkatli olmaya çalıştım çünkü kadınlar benimle anlaşamazsa daha fazla ruh sağlığı sorununa yol açmak istemedim, şükür ki ilk iki kız arkadaşını hatırlamıyor çünkü çok küçüktü

Bir buçuk yıl önce, şimdiki karım Charity ile tanıştığımda ona aşık oldum, her bakımdan muhteşem, güzel, nazik, düşünceli, komik ve daha fazlası, onunla ve oğlumla tanıştığımda onun özel biri olduğunu biliyordum ona karşı çok nazik ve şefkatliydi oğlumun da ondan hoşlanmasını ve ona hayran olmasını istedim ilişkimizin gereksiz ayrıntılarını aylar önce ona evlenme teklif ettiğimde atlayacağım o kabul etti ve nişanlandık

bir şeyler değişmeye başladı bana özelde bir çocuğu olan biriyle nişanlandığı için kendini bir kaybeden gibi hissettiğini söylemeye başladı bu çocukla nasıl başa çıkması gerektiğiyle ilgili korkunç şeyler söyledi bu şeyler daha küçük başladı ve daha sık ve daha sert ve incitici olmaya başladı çılgınca olan şey oğluma karşı çok nazik ve tatlıydı ona hiç kötü bir şey söylemedi bu yüzden kafam nasıl başa çıkacağım konusunda karışıktı nişanlım oğlum olduğu gerçeğinden nefret ediyordu bana keşke oğlum olmasaydı çünkü o zaman mükemmel olurdum diyordu bana hiç uyuşturucu bağımlısı olan oğlunun olmasını ister miydin gibi şeyler soruyor

en kötü yanı ailemden hiçbiri onun ne dediğini bilmiyor onun gözündeki karakterini korumak istedim birine söylersem bana bunun doğru olmadığını ve belki de yapmamamız gerektiğini söyleyeceklerini biliyordum evleniyorum bu yüzden bunu bir sır olarak sakladım artık evliyiz ve durmadı belki evlenirsek anlaşma tamamlanır ve oğlum hakkında şikayet etmesinin bir anlamı olmazdı aptalca hayal ürünü düşünceler

bu uzun bir yazıydı ama umarım bir çocuğu olan biriyle çıkan veya evli olan kişiler bana bildirir eğer sizin de eşinizin çocuğuna karşı benzer hisleriniz varsa bu sizin çocuğunuz değil daha önce böyle bir şey söylediniz mi belki de kıskanıyordur"

"My (25F) new partner (23M) of 5…6 months now had sex with me when I wasn’t even fully awake.

I’m still trying to comprehend how I feel, I have trouble processing emotions sometimes. We have slept in the same bed numerous times. I’m his first gf, and he has been kind to me for the most part, and I enjoy being around him. Since we first started having sex it’s always initiated by him, I think his libido has skyrocketed since first discovering how good it feels. Anyway, and quite a few times it’s at like… 2/3am randomly. I’m usually tired as all hell during it and not even fully wet because of how tired I am. 

It happened last night at 3am (I think I remember him thrusting against me for at least 30 min prior to intercourse), and I’m half asleep, not fully conscious. But I’m 98% I heard him pleasuring himself too off and on after I woke up by him grinding against me, which I don’t remember him ever doing this before. And then I heard some sort of wrapper opening, and I knew he was opening a condom (I’m still not fully awake, but after this I listened a little more to see what he would do). 

Before I know it he was on top of me and started having intercourse with me, seeing that my eyes were indeed shut cause I was tired. 

The fact he didn’t even make sure I was awake before he started doing this makes me feel uneasy. And I know I should have said something before he even inserted himself in me, but I didn’t think he would try to have sex with me if I was half asleep… 

I just have an icky feeling in my stomach. 

Update: I had a brief conversation with him last night if he remembers what happened and his story does -not- match mine… saying that I was on my back at first when he got on top of me, when I called him out on the fact I know I was on my stomach when he first penetrated me because it hurt so bad I explicitly remember this part. He then changed it to “I was pleasuring myself between your thighs and it accidentally went in” and he also said he knew I was tired. He said he would not initiate late night sex anymore ","yeni partnerim aylardır benimle seks yaptı, ben daha tam olarak uyanık bile değilken

dün gece sabah oldu, sanırım cinsel ilişkiden önce en az bir dakika bana doğru ittiğini hatırlıyorum ve yarı uykudaydım, tam olarak bilincim yerinde değildi ama uyandıktan sonra ara sıra bana sürtünerek kendini tatmin ettiğini duydum, daha önce hiç böyle bir şey yaptığını hatırlamıyorum ve sonra bir tür ambalajın açıldığını duydum ve prezervatifi açtığını biliyordum, hala tam olarak uyanık değildim ama bundan sonra ne yapacağını görmek için biraz daha dinledim

farkına varmadan o üstümdeydi ve gözlerimin gerçekten kapalı olduğunu gördüğüm için benimle cinsel ilişkiye girmeye başladı çünkü yorgundum

bunu yapmaya başlamadan önce uyanık olduğumdan bile emin olmaması beni huzursuz hissettiriyor ve içime girmeden önce bir şeyler söylemem gerektiğini biliyorum ama yarı uykuluysam benimle seks yapmaya çalışacağını düşünmemiştim

sadece midemde iğrenç bir his var

"Hello everyone,

Throw away account because this is sensitive and most of my (20f) family doesn’t know. 

My 40-year-old mother was in an accident a couple years ago and was treated in the ER of our large city for serious injuries. Once she was stable, and it looked like she was going to be ok, my family all went home to eat and shower before going back to the hospital. It had been a brutal night and we were not allowed to stay for long in her room anyway because of Covid. While we were gone, she suffered a pulmonary embolism, causing cardiac arrest. 

Unknown to all of us, it turned out my mother had a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) order on file with our hospital and they honored it in our absence. She was not against CPR in any general way, for other people, or for religious reasons. We think she made this decision because she suffered from depression, although we had no idea it was bad enough to make her choose this. 

Now we are left to ask the hard questions. Even though an accident and subsequent emergencies ultimately caused her death, I can’t help but toil with the question of whether or not this was self-inflicted. 
She was young and healthy otherwise and may have pulled through without the DNR. 

How do I move on from this? I feel like I blame her and I don’t know how to forgive her. 

EDIT:

Thank you, everyone! 
Firstly, your kind words of understanding were really touching and mean so much to me. ♥️

Secondly, you’ve given me a lot of perspective that I didn’t have before. You’ve even given me a lot to think about as far as what I would want if it were me. I think TV has given me an embellished view of resuscitation. 

My mom was always the kind of person who shared inspirational stories of people overcoming the odds and “miracles”. She also survived a childhood drowning incident at the lake when she was 4, so I guess I just really felt like she would have chosen the possibility of resuscitation and I was surprised when she didn’t. 
So surprised that all I could imagine was that she couldn’t do it herself, but didn’t want to be here anymore if she had the choice. But I guess I have to accept that even if that *was* her feeling, no matter how unlikely, it was still her decision to make. 

I’m going to seek out a grief therapist as some of you have suggested. Thank you all so much for your support and kind words. ♥️","herkese merhaba

bir yaşındaki annem birkaç yıl önce bir kaza geçirdi ve durumu stabil hale geldiğinde ve iyileşecek gibi göründüğünde büyük şehrimizin acil servisinde ciddi yaralanmalar için tedavi edildi ailem hastaneye geri dönmeden önce yemek yemek ve duş almak için eve gittiler çok zor bir geceydi ve zaten covid nedeniyle odasında uzun süre kalmamıza izin verilmiyordu biz yokken akciğer embolisi geçirdi ve kalp krizi geçirdi

hepimizin bilmediği bir şekilde annemin hastanemizde resüsitasyon yapılmaması için bir dnr emri olduğu ve bizim yokluğumuzda buna uydukları ortaya çıktı başkaları için veya dini nedenlerle cpr'ye karşı değildi bu kararı depresyondan muzdarip olduğu için aldığını düşünüyoruz ancak bunun onu bu kararı almaya itecek kadar kötü olduğunu bilmiyorduk

şimdi zor soruları sormak zorunda kalıyoruz bir kaza ve ardından gelen acil durumlar nihayetinde onun ölümüne neden olsa da bunun kendi kendine mi yapıldığı sorusuyla uğraşmaktan kendimi alamıyorum
genç ve sağlıklıydı, aksi takdirde dnr olmadan atlatabilirdi

bunun üstesinden nasıl gelebilirim, sanki onu suçluyormuşum gibi hissediyorum ve onu nasıl affedeceğimi bilmiyorum

düzenle

herkese teşekkür ederim
ilk olarak, anlayışlı nazik sözleriniz gerçekten dokunaklıydı ve benim için çok şey ifade ediyordu

ikincisi, daha önce sahip olmadığım bir sürü bakış açısı verdiniz, hatta bana eğer ben olsaydım ne isteyeceğim konusunda düşünmem için çok şey verdiniz, sanırım televizyon bana resüsitasyona dair süslü bir bakış açısı kazandırdı

annem her zaman insanların zorlukların ve mucizelerin üstesinden geldiği ilham verici hikayeler paylaşan türden bir insandı, ayrıca çocukluğunda gölde boğulma olayından kurtulmuştu, sanırım resüsitasyon olasılığını seçmiş gibi hissettim ve bunu yapmadığında şaşırdım
sadece kendi başına yapamayacağını hayal edebilmem çok şaşırtıcıydı ama seçeneği olsaydı artık burada olmak istemiyordu ama sanırım bunu kabul etmeliyim, bu onun hissi olsa bile, ne kadar düşük ihtimalli olursa olsun, yine de onun kararıydı yap

bazılarınızın önerdiği gibi bir yas terapisti arayacağım desteğiniz ve nazik sözleriniz için hepinize çok teşekkür ederim"
"I'll be 18f next month and have been active with my bf for a few months now. His parents ended up catching us and they told my parents. My mom wasn't too upset or surprised and was just glad we were being safe but my dad keeps calling me a whore and takes every opportunity to slut shame me.

Consensually speaking my body count is 1 and that doesn't make me a whore but my dad is insistent on making me feel bad about it. My mom has tried to get him to stop but nothing has worked. How can I get him to stop?","gelecek ay boşanacağım ve erkek arkadaşımla birkaç aydır aktifim ailesi bizi yakaladı ve aileme söylediler annem çok üzülmedi veya şaşırmadı ve sadece güvende olduğumuz için mutluydu ama babam bana orospu demeye devam ediyor ve beni orospu gibi utandırmak için her fırsatı değerlendiriyor

"So I (25) asked my boyfriend (27) about what he likes about me, and why he loves me? Without even thinking he said that I’m not good looking, I’m not in a proper job, I’m not fit, but despite everything he still loves me and wants to be with me. I am so offended by this but he’s trying to say that he still loves me. It breaks my confidence level that my boyfriend thinks of me like this. I don’t know what to do.

Edit- I broke up with him so many times before but still he convinces me somehow. I want this breakup should be the last one 😩 will update you guys. 

Backstory as why I asked this question in the first place since many asked- 

There was another girl who proposed to him a while back and he rejected her but he constantly talks to me about how wealthy she was nd such things. They talked after a long time, I didn’t really mind they talked but what he said to her triggered me. He said to her that she’s a perfect example of a girlfriend material and he told me this. I agree we had lots of ups and downs, but telling some other girl a perfect girlfriend material just broke me. Then he tried to console me saying, idc about her, I love you, so that’s why I asked what you love about me.

Edit- Broke up with him. Thank you for all your comments. I even used some comments to draft my perfect breakup message, my friend laughed out loud when I send her that message. Thank you thank you so much! ❤️","erkek arkadaşıma bende nelerden hoşlandığını ve neden beni hiç düşünmeden sevdiğini sordum, yakışıklı olmadığımı, düzgün bir işte çalışmadığımı, formda olmadığımı söyledi ama her şeye rağmen beni hala seviyor ve benimle olmak istiyor, bu beni çok kırdı ama hala beni sevdiğini söylemeye çalışıyor, erkek arkadaşımın beni böyle düşünmesi özgüvenimi kırıyor, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum

"I am a professional belly dancer. I’ve been doing it for years before I met my boyfriend. My boyfriend is Arabian and does not like that I do it. He said that he would be too embarrassed to tell his family. He said that it is associated with a lot of shame in his culture. He said he gets jealous when other men see me.

I consider myself to dance professionally. The clothing can be revealing but I try to wear costumes that cover me more. During shows I dance and then leave. I generally never talk to men. Generally nobody touches me inappropriately and if they were I’d take that seriously. During performances I concentrate more on women than men.

I had an every weekend gig for a year. I recently gave this up, mostly for myself because I was growing tired of it, but my bf also wanted me to quit. He doesn’t want me to do any more public performances but told me I can teach other women. He’s also hinting around me removing my belly dance instagram account.

Belly dance is honestly the love of my life and it’s performing that I love most and I’d really like to do more of it.

Is he being reasonable?","ben profesyonel bir göbek dansçısıyım erkek arkadaşımla tanışmadan önce yıllardır yapıyordum erkek arkadaşım arap ve yapmamı sevmiyor ailesine söylemekten çok utanacağını söyledi kültüründe bunun çok utanç verici olduğunu söyledi diğer erkekler beni gördüğünde kıskandığını söyledi

kendimi profesyonel olarak dans ettiğimi düşünüyorum kıyafetler açıklayıcı olabilir ama gösteriler sırasında beni daha fazla örten kostümler giymeye çalışıyorum dans edip sonra ayrılıyorum genelde erkeklerle hiç konuşmuyorum genelde kimse bana uygunsuz şekilde dokunmuyor ve eğer öyleyse performanslar sırasında bunu ciddiye alıyorum erkeklerden çok kadınlara odaklanıyorum

bir yıl boyunca her hafta sonu bir konserim vardı yakın zamanda bundan çoğunlukla kendim için vazgeçtim çünkü bundan sıkılmaya başlamıştım ama erkek arkadaşım da bırakmamı istedi artık halka açık performanslar yapmamı istemiyor ama bana diğer kadınlara eğitim verebileceğimi söyledi ayrıca göbek dansı instagram hesabımı silmem konusunda bana imalarda bulunuyor

göbek dansı dürüst olmak gerekirse hayatımın aşkı ve en çok sevdiğim şey performans sergilemek ve daha fazlasını yapmak istiyorum

makul davranıyor mu"
"I’m not sure when it started, but from what I can tell my boyfriends mom has been calling him sexy for a very long time. Keep in mind he is 20 years old and I am 22 years old. She is constantly admiring his physical body and telling him how “hot” his muscles are and how attractive he is. She also calls him baby, sweetheart, babe, my man, etc. She also has this habit of kissing him on the lips whenever she can, especially when she’s intoxicated. 

It’s always made me uncomfortable, but now so more than ever because I recently discovered a history of sexual abuse and incest within the family tree, and I’m afraid that between the obvious dysfunction of his family, that he may have been abused when he was younger and he has subconsciously pushed it into the farthest corners of his mind. 

Am I incorrect for feeling this way? I don’t know what to do about his mother because I don’t want her to hate me but I find it extremely inappropriate to be calling her own child sexy and hot.

UPDATE: Thank you to everyone for your advice. I broke it off last night after thinking long and hard about it. My mental health is the utmost important thing and I know that if I were to stay in this relationship, I would be in competition with his mother till the day she dies and that is not something that is worth it to me. I know I can find myself a man who already has a healthy relationship with his mother. Again, thank you to everyone for helping me out. You are all greatly appreciated. Much love to you all❤️","ne zaman başladığından emin değilim ama gördüğüm kadarıyla erkek arkadaşımın annesi ona çok uzun zamandır seksi diyor, onun yaşında olduğunu ve benim de yaşında olduğumu unutmayın, sürekli onun fiziksel bedenine hayranlık duyuyor ve ona kaslarının ne kadar ateşli ve çekici olduğunu söylüyor, ayrıca ona bebeğim tatlım bebeğim erkeğim vb. diyor, ayrıca özellikle sarhoşken onu dudaklarından öpme alışkanlığı da var

bu beni her zaman rahatsız ediyordu ama şimdi her zamankinden daha fazla çünkü yakın zamanda aile ağacında cinsel taciz ve ensest geçmişi keşfettim ve ailesinin bariz işlevsizliği nedeniyle daha küçükken tacize uğramış olabileceğinden ve bunu bilinçaltında zihninin en uzak köşelerine ittiğinden korkuyorum

böyle hissettiğim için yanlış mı hissediyorum, annesi hakkında ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum çünkü benden nefret etmesini istemiyorum ama kendi çocuğuna seksi ve ateşli demesini son derece uygunsuz buluyorum

"She has been with her boyfriend, to my knowledge, for six months. She got her IUD a week later. I have never pried into her romantic or sex life, but she has been sexually active with him at home.  
  
Two weeks ago, a man came over late on Saturday night. I sounded like they were having sex. I didn't see him, but I heard his voice as they were talking, and then heard sounds coming from her room. Then last night, the same thing happened.  
  
Her boyfriend of six months has slept over twice during the time since the previous encounter with the other man. I don't think they've broken up, but yet she is clearly sleeping with the other man. I suspect she doesn't know I can tell.

"I(39m) was married to my wife Bridgette, for 14 years. 3 years ago my wife and my 8year old son were killed by a drunk driver, leaving me and my two daughters(17 and 4) behind. The first 6 months I had a severely unhealthy relationship with alcohol in which my daughters stayed with my mother bc I was nowhere near fit to be a father in that moment, I did get help though. My eldest daughter is in therapy for depression, I have joined a support group for grief where I met my current gf who lost her husband to cancer. We’ve been dating for almost 5 months, and I finally decided to bring her home to meet my girls.

My youngest loved her, my oldest hates her. She says I’m not being a father they deserve and I’m trying to replace her mother. This is hard for me because this is the first woman I even thought about since Bridgette, Bridgette was the love of my life no one could ever replace her. My current girlfriend understands my grief of losing a spouse, and my current gf is willing to try and be a parental figure to my girls. My eldest daughter has made threats so large as to run away if I continue seeing this girlfriend.

"okay so, this is my first reddit post and it is so funny that it is about this.

so in my dorm room building, there is a light well and all the windows face the inside of this corridor type thing. this means we can see into our neighbors across the hall’s dorm as well as our neighbors one floor down. also my bed is right up against the window for context. 

a little bit ago, maybe before spring break (our spring break is really early), i was sitting down in bed and was casually looking out the window, and i saw something i promise i was not trying to see. the girl one floor down had her blinds all the way up and the lights on and was masturbating fully uncovered and naked facing towards the window. her whole bed is facing vertically towards the window. at first i didn’t think anything of it, and was kinda feeling guilty because i felt as though i invaded her privacy. i told my roommates and they said that it wad a completely understandable accident especially because she was doing it with the blinds up and facing the window. i thought it would be a one time thing, but it has gotten to the point now where i see her almost everyday or multiple times in a day. it is like almost every time i glance out my window either to sit down in bed or sit up to go to the bathroom i see her doing it. 

i will also add that this is the only window in the room, and without it open, it gets so dark in here because we face the inside of a light well. 

i am conflicted as to what to do now. do i tell her that i can see her doing this? or do i let it go? is this something normal that happens? should i feel bad about this?

also, i am not shaming her at all. she can do what she wants i do it too… with the blinds closed. i just maybe think making other people uncomfortable with it is not good????

EDIT: I will also add now that i am female (sorry i should have clarified that i guess)","tamam bu benim ilk reddit gönderim ve bunun bununla ilgili olması çok komik

"Basically, when I was 3, my aunt had put me in front of an IPad during a family get-together type thing. My parents insisted not to, since I had the tendency to click on anything with cool colours, but she ignored them and said it worked with her kids, so it would be fine for me.

Long story short, I bought a ton of audio-book things. Not sure how much  had spent, since I was super young and don't even remember it fully. She got super mad (understandably), but my parents paid her back. THEN she insisted that the money came from my allowance. Reminder, I was 3.

My parents refused, and she got even more mad, even though they already gave her the money.

And then, when I was ten, I had to meet her again, and she 'lovingly' reminded me of the incident from years prior, and then asked me to pay her back. I gave her the only money I had because I had a fear of authority figures (probably like 20 dollars from Christmas or something), but she STILL seemed mad.

Saw her again a few weeks ago, I'm 19 now, and she asked me to pay her back again. I refused, because I know pretty well that my parents paid her back fully back when it happened, and 10 year old me gave her some money, so I don't see a reason that I should give her any more.

She got mad and called me a brat, which honestly made me pretty upset.

I do love her, she's my aunt, but I don't know how to get her to just forgive me. Any advice on how to go about the situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Some people have pointed out the fact that IPads weren't released until later. Gonna be honest, I'm both not sure how old EXACTLY I was, since (as said) I don't even fully remember the actual incident anyways. Also, It could've been some other device, I just refer to anything with a flat screen like that as an IPad. But thanks for the concern. ","temelde ben teyzem bir aile toplantısı sırasında beni bir ipad'in önüne koymuştu, ebeveynlerim havalı renklere sahip herhangi bir şeye tıklama eğilimim olduğu için yapmama konusunda ısrar ettiler ama teyzem onları görmezden geldi ve bunun çocuklarında işe yaradığını ve benim için sorun olmayacağını söyledi

uzun lafın kısası bir sürü sesli kitap aldım, çok küçükken ne kadar harcadığımı bilmiyorum ve tam olarak hatırlamıyorum bile, anlaşılabilir bir şekilde çok sinirlendi ama ebeveynlerim ona geri ödedi sonra paranın harçlığımdan geldiğini söyledi hatırlattım

ebeveynlerim reddetti ve parayı zaten ona vermiş olmalarına rağmen daha da sinirlendi

ve sonra on yaşındayken onunla tekrar görüşmek zorunda kaldım ve bana yıllar önceki olayı sevgiyle hatırlattı ve sonra ona geri ödememi istedi, otorite figürlerinden korktuğum için sahip olduğum tek parayı ona verdim, muhtemelen noelden kalma dolarlar veya başka bir şeydi ama yine de sinirli görünüyordu

birkaç hafta önce onu tekrar gördüm ve bana ona geri ödememi istedi, reddettim çünkü ebeveynlerimin ona tam olarak geri ödediğini çok iyi biliyorum, olay olduğunda ve yıl eski ben ona biraz para verdim bu yüzden ona daha fazla para vermem için bir neden göremiyorum

"I’m not going to delete the post but I can’t sleep and I think reading everything is kind of overwhelming me and making it worse. I will be updating tomorrow. (Probably 6pm est) For now, I think I will be telling them I will not have access to the money for a week and trying to picking up extra shifts because I can kind of feel how this may play out. as far as my living situation if they are still not willing to clarify on their plans with it I will attempt to minimize as much time as I can here while keeping backup options. Thank you all for sharing your point of view/thoughts so far. 

Update: I actually went to to work today to get out of the house and shop for gifts.  I came home not too long ago they’re actually going in a diff route right now. My father is saying how he hasn’t been feeling well and he thinks it’s from the stress from me not “putting the money in their account”. My mom isn’t speaking to me. (Honestly better than I thought because she has a tendency to rage) I also told them I can’t access the money and I actually really have no access to the money right now so I’m not lying when I tell them this. I went to go buy Christmas gifts so maybe we can get back to enjoy the holidays :) I spoke with my lawyer today as well and he told me there is no repercussions as they were not involved at all in the accident. 

Q/A
Q: Why do they know? 
A: didn’t think anything of it when I told them I got into an accident they referred me a chiropractor. We had no idea I was going to get a settlement over 9. They told me since I’ve never been in an accident they’d be more than happy to make sure I’m not getting scammed but it just seemed like they were trying to claim it on my behalf before I could.

Q: Why don’t I go live on my own? 
A: I was since I was 19 just came back now to finish school. I was originally going to wait till I was 24. My mom insisted I come back to finish school and better our relationship. My parents are super traditional and carry their cultural beliefs proudly and they were ashamed and angry to find out my sexuality.

Q: Do you pay rent?
A: No I do not pay rent before I came back my very traditional parents did not agree with my line of work so they asked me to leave it since I wasn’t going to have to pay rent here and that I should just get a part time somewhere ‘normal’.

"Serious advice needed because I am LOST

I (f) have been with my boyfriend, I’ll call him Adam for almost a year now. I met him through my masters degree in the U.K. 
When I was a sophomore in college I had a long term boyfriend, who I’ll call Kyle, who took his own life. We were together for 3 years and I would never wish the pain of losing someone like that on my worst enemy. 

When we started college, Kyle gifted me a locket with the word “most” engraved on the back of it. It was our thing, It meant he loved me most. Sappy, But It was ours. 
Since his passing this has been my most valuable possession and I do not go anywhere without it. It is my last piece of Kyle.

After finishing my degree and struggling the entire time I decided that I needed to get out of the town where everything happened and decided to study my masters degree in the U.K, which is where I met Adam.

He is the first person I have allowed myself to love since losing Kyle. And I really have loved our relationship up until this. If it is true I will never be able to forgive him. 

Adam has always been insecure of Kyle, asking hypothetical questions like if Kyle was still alive would I be with him, and what I prefer about him over Kyle etc etc. I usually dodge the questions and never give him an answer as I don’t condone these type of questions and don’t want to feed into it. 

We have also had to have several conversations regarding Adam talking badly about Kyle, He also dislikes If I post about Kyle on his birthday or death anniversary or have hard days. He sees this as that I don’t love him and am still hung up on Kyle.

No matter how many years that pass, and how much I love Adam, Kyle was my first and his life was cut short. He was also my best friend. I will mourn his life forever, even if I have moved on romantically. 

He knows how much this necklace from Kyle means to me, and how devastated I’ve been the last two weeks frantically searching our apartment for it. 

I took a shower one day and set the necklace in the same place I always do, when I came out of the shower It was gone and Adam swears he has no idea where it is and it must’ve fallen somewhere and got lost. I have been beside myself, spent nights in tears over losing this. 

Adam has a sister who we will call Jane. Jane recently celebrated her 21st birthday. I am in her Snapchat private story where she posted the beautiful locket that her big brother got her for her special day.

IT WAS THE SAME LOCKET. I know it, because it has the same engraving on the back. I don’t know how Adam explained that one, but he must have some how. Me and Jane are not particularly close and this isn’t something I feel I can just confront her about casually. I also feel silly bringing it up to Adam incase it isn’t the same Locket and I am just going insane and looking for excuses because I was careless and lost it. 

I don’t see where else Adam would have got this locket, as it was made for me by a small business back in the States. She was local to Kyle and I and her work as always been my favorite. 

Advice on how to ask Adam about this? I know if I do he’ll deny it either way, and this locket means the world to me. I need it back.

Thanks! 

**Update***

Thanks everyone for all the advice!

It’s been almost 3 weeks since I posted and I didn’t plan to update but I’ve seen a few comments asking for one. 

A day or two after the initial post, I confronted Adam about the locket. He claimed did not know what I was talking about, and he couldn’t believe I could be as cold as to accuse him of this. When asked for receipts or any proof that the locket was not the same as mine he couldn’t produce any and got angry and stormed out of our apartment.

He came back that night, tried to gaslight me into believe I was the one who created a problem out of nothing, and even that the necklace he got his sister had no engraving whatsoever. 

Unlucky for him, I had contacted his mom while he was away, stated that I had misplaced my Lockett and was wondering if it had accidentally taken home by Adam when he was visiting. She got back to me pretty quickly saying that she had found my necklace on her daughter Jane’s present pile stacked away in a corner. She said that she would return the necklace to me as soon as possible and that herself or Jane must have mistaken it for one of her presents and put it back in the pile. She promised me that she would keep a hold of it in her room until she got the chance to return it. 

Immediately after I had confirmation that Adams Mom had the Lockett I booked the cheapest flight home I could find and asked his mom for a lift to the airport, that way she could return the necklace. She agreed and after that I sat planning exactly how I would tell Adam that we were breaking up. 
I didn’t need him to admit to stealing the necklace, the fact that I had enough doubt in my mind that I knew he had taken it was enough for me to know that this relationship was going nowhere. I just wanted my necklace back. 

I stayed with Adam, until my flight which was about a week ago. I let him and his mom drive me to the airport. I left a note, breaking up with him. Telling him that my friends would be by to pick up my stuff and move it between their flats. I took a leave of absence from Uni until I work out where I am going to stay when I get back to the UK, and have contacted my landlord about taking my name off the lease. 

When Adams mom gave me back my necklace, his face was priceless. He looked like a dear in the headlights. He was so angry. But he couldn’t show it in front of his mom. His sister Jane hasn’t once questioned the missing necklace and it’s been around 2 weeks now. I doubt she will ever notice, she is rather spoilt. 

I am glad to update that I am safe, I am back home, with my necklace from Kyle. I am just home from visiting with his grave, telling him this entire storing and laughing about it. It reminded me that I should update. And probably hold higher standards in men for myself.

Thanks for your love and support","serious advice needed because i am lost

i f have been with my boyfriend ill call him adam for almost a year now i met him through my masters degree in the uk 
when i was a sophomore in college i had a long term boyfriend who ill call kyle who took his own life we were together for  years and i would never wish the pain of losing someone like that on my worst enemy 

when we started college kyle gifted me a locket with the word most engraved on the back of it it was our thing it meant he loved me most sappy but it was ours 
since his passing this has been my most valuable possession and i do not go anywhere without it it is my last piece of kyle

after finishing my degree and struggling the entire time i decided that i needed to get out of the town where everything happened and decided to study my masters degree in the uk which is where i met adam

he is the first person i have allowed myself to love since losing kyle and i really have loved our relationship up until this if it is true i will never be able to forgive him 

adam has always been insecure of kyle asking hypothetical questions like if kyle was still alive would i be with him and what i prefer about him over kyle etc etc i usually dodge the questions and never give him an answer as i dont condone these type of questions and dont want to feed into it 

we have also had to have several conversations regarding adam talking badly about kyle he also dislikes if i post about kyle on his birthday or death anniversary or have hard days he sees this as that i dont love him and am still hung up on kyle

no matter how many years that pass and how much i love adam kyle was my first and his life was cut short he was also my best friend i will mourn his life forever even if i have moved on romantically 

he knows how much this necklace from kyle means to me and how devastated ive been the last two weeks frantically searching our apartment for it 

i took a shower one day and set the necklace in the same place i always do when i came out of the shower it was gone and adam swears he has no idea where it is and it mustve fallen somewhere and got lost i have been beside myself spent nights in tears over losing this

Adams'ın annesi bana kolyemi geri verdiğinde yüzü paha biçilemezdi, farlarda çok tatlı görünüyordu, çok öfkeliydi ama bunu annesinin önünde gösteremedi, kız kardeşi Jane kaybolan kolyeyi bir kez bile sorgulamadı ve haftalardır ortalıkta dolaşıyor, sanırım fark etmeyecektir, oldukça şımarık

Güvende olduğumu güncellemekten memnunum, Kyle'dan aldığım kolyemle evdeyim, mezarını ziyaret etmekten yeni döndüm, ona tüm bu depolamayı anlattım ve bununla ilgili güldüm, bana güncelleme yapmam ve muhtemelen kendim için erkeklere karşı daha yüksek standartlar belirlemem gerektiğini hatırlattı

"My boyfriend has just admitted to me that he is transgender, a girl. we started dating and he hadn’t told me he’s transgender until just now, i dont like that..

don’t get me wrong i have nothing against transgender people, but i think he looks better as a boy and i wouldn’t want him as a girl, it’s just not my preference anyway. 
just knowing that he is now transgender is confusing me and it’s not something i want, a part of me is begging for it to just be a lie but i don’t think it is.

what do i do? do i break up with him or do i wait it out see if it’s.. nothing. 

any advice would be appreciated ","erkek arkadaşım bana transgender olduğunu itiraf etti, çıkmaya başladığımız bir kızdı ve bana daha yeni transgender olduğunu söylemişti, bundan hoşlanmıyorum

sadece artık transgender olduğunu bilmek beni şaşırtıyor ve istediğim bir şey değil, bir parçam bunun sadece bir yalan olmasını istiyor ama bence öyle değil

ne yapmalıyım, onunla ayrılmalı mıyım yoksa bir şey olup olmadığını görmek için beklemeli miyim

"I (47F) have been married to my husband (46M) for about 2 years. I lost a good paying job a few months ago (not my fault) and am working as a substitute teacher while I apply for something more stable. We have been splitting the rent 50/50, but I make so much less than my husband now. Rent and monthly expenses for each of us is 1200, but I get paid somewhere around 1800 a month. I think that a more fair arrangement for the time being would be for us to split the rent 40/60 or 30/70, depending on how much I get paid. My husband was very upset by this and said it “isn’t what I signed up for.” My other stresses right now are dealing with elderly parents with serious health issues and my own journey into perimenopause, which are both difficult to deal with. I don’t think I’m making an unreasonable suggestion; in fact, I think that marriage is supposed to be a partnership. My husband doesn’t seem to have the same view of marriage that I do. If the tables were turned, I would certainly be willing to help him out temporarily. He’s willing to go to therapy, but I’m starting to think that we might just be incompatible.

"I go to take a shower and there is snot on the walls of the shower. I want to puke. I’m enraged right now. He doesn’t clean it up ever. He thinks “it’s okay it goes down the drain”, well actually no because it’s splattered around the walls. 

I literally can’t live with someone like this. I’m not the cleanest person but I NEED my bathroom to be clean. I NEED my shower to be spotless or I won’t want to get in it. I told him I’m he needs to clean the shower very very well when he gets home from work and that if he ever blows his nose in the shower again or if I ever find so much as one tiny booger on the shower walls he will be finding his own place to live and we will be done.

Am I over reacting? I know people will say that blowing your snot in the shower isn’t gross but these are also the same people that probably piss in the shower. Sorry I have standards??? What do I have to do to get it through to him that this type of pig behaviour is a total deal breaker?!?!?

"So... this is a hard post to write, but here we go. A few days ago, I was told I only have about a month left to live. It still doesn’t feel real. But after sitting with the news for a bit, I decided that I don’t want to spend whatever time I have left just wasting away.

I’ve always been a hard worker. I managed to land a high-paying job early in life, and I've been working non-stop ever since. I had plans for the future, things I wanted to do ""when I had time,"" but now, I’ve got to fit everything into these next few weeks.

Here’s the thing: I want to make the most of this time, but I don’t know where to start. I want to travel, experience new things, meet people, and just live without holding back. So, I’m turning to you, Reddit. What would you do if you were in my shoes? What are some experiences, places, or things I absolutely shouldn’t miss out on?

"Hello, I’m a former Coke, weed, and Xanax user. I’m currently in a recovery program. I have graduated from the intensive program that was all week and have now been put in the less intensive program that is 3 days a week. I have no plans of using again. I desperately want to get a job to start paying my parents back for rehab. 

I just want to put this part of my life behind me and get a job I can work for the long run. I can’t go back to school until January so just going to school and waiting it out isn’t an option and I will have to work and go to school at the same time.

 Im tested in program twice a week and my numbers are painfully low. I’m in the 80s. Do any detox products actually work? I was a habitual user for the better part of 8 years. Any forms of work that don’t require drug test that have an actual ability to move up? I’m willing to get certifications if that make it possible for me to work. I realize I fucked up. 

I can possibly get a medical card for thc, would that make me employable? I live in Texas so it’s not necessarily easy to get but my psychiatrist has told me I qualify. Honestly I do not want to use anymore so it would just be to get a job. Weed in this state is flat out not worth it. Too much of it is laced, and moving to a state that recognizes the use for ptsd is not an option for years to come. I’m not well off, and I’m starting to panic.

"My fiancée (25M) and I (25F) are paying for all wedding related expences. We did so because we did not want our parents to have the opportunity of saying ""i'm paying for it so we are doing this way"".  Basically, we make sure to get their opinion but our parents are basically honor GUESTS at out wedding. 

I am clarifying this since in our traditions, parents are the one usualy doing the wedding for their children but we did not want that. 

The wedding is not too big about 200 people. But a lot are family that is flying in for the wedding. For such, my parents want to gather people to offer them a supper. And both me and my fiancée were totally ok with this. Go to a restaurant and eat with how ever many people you want. But now my parents told me they are going to rent a reception room, a dj, a catoring service, etc. They also want to invite my fiancé's parents to this ""dinner"" and they want me to be in a wedding gown ... 

I told my parents i was NOT ok with this. But they are getting mad at me because they say it's tradition. I DO NOT WANT TRADITION.... Some of my traditions are scrary, borderline traumatizing and supper misogynistic. And it's not like i cut my parents out of the wedding process. I just made sure they don't pay for anything so that their opinions is an option and we have the final say. 

My partner and i are confused and we find this so weird and rude. They are legit throwing almost a wedding before the actual wedding.

bunu açıklığa kavuşturuyorum çünkü geleneklerimizde ebeveynler genellikle çocukları için düğünü yapan kişilerdir ama biz bunu istemedik

düğün çok fazla insanla ilgili değil ama düğüne uçakla gelen çok sayıda aile var bu yüzden ebeveynlerim insanları bir araya getirip onlara akşam yemeği sunmak istiyorlar ve hem ben hem de nişanlım buna tamamen tamam dedik bir restorana gidip istediğiniz kadar kişiyle yemek yiyoruz ama şimdi ebeveynlerim bana bir resepsiyon odası, bir DJ, bir catering hizmeti vb. kiralayacaklarını söylediler ayrıca nişanlımın ebeveynlerini bu yemeğe davet etmek istiyorlar ve benim gelinlik giymemi istiyorlar

ebeveynlerime buna onay vermediğimi söyledim ama bana kızıyorlar çünkü bunun gelenek olduğunu söylüyorlar gelenek istemiyorum bazı geleneklerim ürkütücü ve neredeyse travmatize edici ve akşam yemeği kadın düşmanı ve sanki anne babamı düğün sürecinden çıkarmışım gibi değil sadece hiçbir şey için ödeme yapmamalarını sağladım böylece onların fikirleri bir seçenek oluyor ve son söz bizde

"**Wow... I didn't know my family was this sneaky and messed up.** 

A little backstory is my mom really wanted to go to Hawaii for her 60th birthday a few years ago. She invited our family (her husband, my half sister (younger, 18 years old), my half brother (38 years old) with his GF, and me &amp; my husband) to accompany her in her dream vacation. Her husband had a heart attack a couple years prior to them planning this a few years ago and was having complications so the trip was cancelled. *(Please keep in mind, she was not concerned about his health whatsoever, she was mad she married an alcoholic man who is ""ruining her life"" in her ""elder years"" because she thought she would be able to travel now but can't since he has had so many health complications due to his alcoholism therefore the trip being canceled.)*

To my surprise, I found out they all just went to Hawaii last week. 

They were planning the originally vacation for over 2 years in advance before it was canceled, so how long have I gone to their birthdays or graduations or holiday events with them knowing they were going to Hawaii and intentionally leaving me out? I am so hurt I can't even express it. I think I need to go no contact with them. We didn't have a fight or anything, I just don't understand why they would be so hurtful and knowingly leave me &amp; my husband out? To make it all sting worse, my little sisters BF of not even a year was invited to go with ""the family"" for ""the family trip"". 

**I found out about this after they got back. They didn't even tell me they were leaving.** And my mom just nonchalantly said ""oh yeah we just got back from Hawaii"". I noticed she wasn't talking about my brother (she normally talks about him a lot) and so I asked how is he doing? My mom weakly said ""oh they went on the trip with us."" 

It is no secret my mom has always chosen men over me. I am wondering if her husband (who dislikes me) said I am not invited? I am so confused why I was left out if I was once included. Like I said, we didn't have a fight or a fall out or anything negative happening except the fact that her husband dislikes me. I am so hurt and confused. *I was the one who was there for my mom when she would cry her eyes out about her hating her husband, hating her life, hating how she raised every single one of her kids. I am the one that reassured her she is a good mom and did the best she could at the time.* 

  
It is more than simply not being invited to a family trip I was originally invited to. It is the fact that they: Planned this for over a year and didn't say a word. They didn't tell me they were leaving. She intentionally left out who went until I asked. None of them posted anything on social media about the trip, like they are trying to hide the evidence. ?? It is just bizarre. My mom was never the best mom to me, but I didn't think she would ever do something like this on this scale of things. It all feels malicious &amp; mean. 

I don't know how to move on from this. I am a grown adult (30 years old) and my husband says he is proud of me &amp; how mature I was in the moment when she told me. He said he sees my growth and he is my family now. Silver lining to this is it is definitely bringing me and my husband even closer together. 

Should I go completely no contact? I really don't know what to do. I've done some research on minimal vs no contact and it seems like no contact is the best way to proceed. I would just appreciate an outsiders perspective - what would you do? Thank you ","vay canına ailemin bu kadar sinsi ve beceriksiz olduğunu bilmiyordum

Şaşırtıcı bir şekilde hepsinin geçen hafta Hawaii'ye gittiğini öğrendim

aslında tatillerini iptal etmeden önce yıllar öncesinden planlıyorlardı, bu yüzden Hawaii'ye gideceklerini bilerek ve beni bilerek dışarıda bırakarak onlarla doğum günlerine, mezuniyetlerine veya tatil etkinliklerine ne kadar süre gittim, çok incindim ifade bile edemiyorum sanırım onlarla hiçbir şekilde iletişimi kesmem gerekiyor kavga etmedik ya da başka bir şey yapmadık neden bu kadar incittiklerini ve bilerek beni ve kocamı her şeyi daha da kötü hale getirmek için dışarıda bıraktıklarını anlamıyorum daha bir yıllık bile olmayan küçük kız kardeşimin erkek arkadaşı aile gezisine aileyle birlikte davet edildi

bunu geri döndükten sonra öğrendim bana gideceklerini bile söylemediler ve annem umursamazca evet hawaii'den yeni döndük dedi kardeşimden bahsetmediğini fark ettim normalde ondan çok bahsederdi bu yüzden nasıl olduğunu sordum annem zayıf bir şekilde dedi bizimle geziye geldiler

annemin her zaman benden çok erkekleri seçtiği bir sır değil benden hoşlanmayan kocasının davet edilmediğimi söylemesi beni neden dışladığını çok merak ediyorum bir zamanlar dahil edildiğim gibi kavga etmedik ya da anlaşmazlığa düşmedik ya da kocasının benden hoşlanmaması dışında olumsuz bir şey olmadı çok incindim ve kafam karıştı annem için ağladığında yanında olan bendim kocasından nefret ediyor hayatından nefret ediyor çocuklarının her birini nasıl yetiştirdiğinden nefret ediyor ona iyi bir anne olduğunu ve o sırada elinden gelenin en iyisini yaptığını söyleyen bendim

aslında davet edildiğim bir aile gezisine davet edilmememden daha fazlası bu bir yıldan uzun süredir bunu planladılar ve tek kelime etmediler bana gideceklerini söylemediler bilerek kimlerin gittiğini sormadan önce hiçbiri sosyal medyada gezi hakkında hiçbir şey paylaşmadı sanki kanıtı gizlemeye çalışıyorlarmış gibi bu çok tuhaf annem benim için asla en iyi anne olmadı ama böyle bir şeyi bu ölçekte yapacağını hiç düşünmemiştim her şey kötü niyetli ve acımasız hissettiriyor

bunun üstesinden nasıl geleceğimi bilmiyorum ben yetişkin bir yetişkinim ve kocam benimle gurur duyduğunu ve bana söylediğinde ne kadar olgun olduğumu söylüyor gelişimimi gördüğünü ve artık benim ailem olduğunu söyledi bunun olumlu tarafı kesinlikle beni ve kocamı daha da yakınlaştırıyor

tamamen iletişimi kesmeli miyim gerçekten ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum biraz yaptım minimal ve hiç temas kurmama konusunda araştırma yaptım ve hiç temas kurmamanın en iyi yol olduğu anlaşılıyor, sadece dışarıdan birinin bakış açısını takdir ediyorum, siz ne yapardınız, teşekkür ederim"
"I (32M) have been with my wife (30F) since my last year of college, we were married 2 years ago. My wife has an identical twin sister (30F) I’ll call Shiela.

Ever since my wife and I first got together, Sheila immediately wrote me off. She was flippant, rude, and generally didn’t seem like she enjoyed talking to me at all. She rolled with sorority girls, always prioritized her appearance, while my wife and I were more nerdy and kept to ourselves in school. My wife and I fell in love hard and fast, and it’s been that way ever since.

But from the jump, I always got the sense that Sheila thought I might not have been good enough for her sister, seeing that I came from a tougher home-life while they grew up in a relatively healthy upbringing with no major upheavals. But I’ve always made the most of my education, fully supported myself financially from a young age, and prioritized treating others with kindness. But Sheila just thought I was less-than, or at least she certainly took every opportunity to treat me that way on the few occasions we did see eachother (she’d ignore me while I was talking directly to her, never smile when I’d try to break the ice, and would go out of her way to convince others in our friend-group that I was ‘odd’ cause I wasn’t a rich kid like every one else was.)

As my wife and I clearly got more serious, she started to gradually make attempts at hanging out with us as we all live in the same city. Throughout this warm-up period, I noted that her sister just genuinely was not a nice person; making fun of people for their appearance, consistently commenting on how good-looking her and her twin were, and just generally making rude comments to me whenever my wife was out of earshot. She knew exactly how to push my buttons, and I - literally to the point of real pain - have had to bite my tongue on several occasions to stop myself from biting her back.

Over the last few years though, I haven’t been so good at the tongue biting any more. Without getting into too much detail, I bit her back. During dinner amongst my wife’s family, Sheila started insulting people that don’t dress well. Her family (having inherited real wealth) laughed along as she generally ragged on what she called ‘ghetto’ people that didn’t dress well in public. In front of everyone, I made an unsavory comment along the lines of “if dressing well was all it would take to be respectable and liked in the world, what the fuck happened with you?”.. blah blah. Anyways she cried and stormed upstairs, and to this day I’m the bad guy according to her family.

But here’s where I need advice:

Every time my wife and I go out, and her sister joins us, my wife and I always end up getting into some bullshit fight before we even make it back home because I just keep noticing my wife emulating her sister’s behavior more and more. Making cruel jokes at peoples’ expense, being straight up vain, and joining in on whatever jibe Sheila decides to throw my way when she’s just ‘joking around’. My wife barely seems like she wants me there half the time because she’s only interested in talking to her sister whether it’s just the 3 of us or with a whole group of friends. She always has such a great time, while I’m just left to stew in wonder of how her sister has gotten away with being so nasty for so long.

I keep blaming these fights we have on other shit just to avoid having to tell my wife that I absolutely do not like her twin sister. The more my wife behaves like her, the more distant and aloof I get. I just know that once I put those words out into the world that “your sister is a fucking demon and I can’t stand having this bully in my life”, that I can’t take them back. That we might not stay together once she realizes that I’ll never fit in comfortably with her family because of my dislike of her sister.

I love my wife, and I want to make this work, but I don’t know what to do. So, any advice?","Eşimle üniversitedeki son yılımdan beri birlikteyiz, yıllar önce evlendik, eşimin özdeş bir ikiz kız kardeşi var, Shiela diyelim

Eşimle ilk tanıştığımızdan beri Sheila beni hemen sildi, küstah ve kaba biriydi ve benimle konuşmaktan hiç hoşlanmıyormuş gibi görünüyordu, kız kardeşlik topluluğuyla iyi geçinirdi, her zaman görünüşüne öncelik verirdi, eşim ve ben ise daha inektik ve okulda kendi kendimize kalırdık, eşim ve ben çok çabuk aşık olduk ve o zamandan beri böyle oldu

ama en başından beri Sheila'nın kız kardeşi için yeterince iyi olmadığımı düşündüğü hissine kapıldım, çünkü ben daha zor bir aile hayatından geliyordum, onlar ise büyük çalkantılar yaşamadan nispeten sağlıklı bir şekilde büyüdüler ama ben her zaman eğitimimden en iyi şekilde yararlandım, genç yaştan itibaren kendimi maddi olarak tamamen destekledim ve başkalarına karşı nazik davranmayı önceliklendirdim ama Sheila beni yetersiz gördü ya da en azından birbirimizi gördüğümüz birkaç durumda bana öyle davranmak için her fırsatı değerlendirdi, doğrudan onunla konuşurken beni görmezden geldi, ben konuşurken asla gülümsemedi buzları kırmaya çalışırdı ve arkadaş grubumuzdaki diğerlerini, herkes gibi zengin bir çocuk olmadığım için tuhaf olduğuma ikna etmek için elinden geleni yapardı

karım ve ben açıkça daha ciddileştikçe, hepimiz aynı şehirde yaşadığımız için bizimle takılmak için yavaş yavaş girişimlerde bulunmaya başladı bu ısınma döneminde kız kardeşinin gerçekten iyi bir insan olmadığını, insanların görünüşleriyle dalga geçtiğini, sürekli olarak kendisinin ve ikizinin ne kadar güzel göründüğüne dair yorumlarda bulunduğunu ve karım duymayacak kadar uzakta olduğunda bana kaba yorumlarda bulunduğunu fark ettim, düğmelerime nasıl basacağını tam olarak biliyordu ve ben kelimenin tam anlamıyla gerçek bir acı noktasına kadar, kendimi onun sırtını ısırmaktan alıkoymak için birkaç kez dilimi ısırmak zorunda kaldım

son birkaç yıldır, çok fazla ayrıntıya girmeden, artık dil ısırmada iyi değilim, çok fazla ayrıntıya girmeden, karımın ailesinin arasında akşam yemeğinde sırtını ısırdım Sheila, iyi giyinmeyen insanlara hakaret etmeye başladı, ailesi gerçek servet miras almıştı, herkesin önünde iyi giyinmeyen getto insanları olarak adlandırdığı insanlara genel olarak sataşırken güldü, ben de şu şekilde hoş olmayan bir yorum yaptım eğer iyi giyinmek dünyada saygın ve sevilen biri olmak için yeterli olsaydı seninle ne oldu falan filan neyse ağladı ve yukarı çıktı ve ailesine göre bugüne kadar kötü adam ben oldum

ama işte burada tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var

karım ve ben her dışarı çıktığımızda ve kız kardeşi bize katıldığında, eve dönmeden önce karımla her zaman saçma sapan bir kavgaya tutuşuyoruz çünkü karımın kız kardeşinin davranışlarını giderek daha fazla taklit ettiğini, insanların pahasına acımasız şakalar yaptığını, düpedüz kendini beğenmiş olduğunu ve sheila'nın şaka yaparken bana atmaya karar verdiği her türlü alaya katıldığını fark ediyorum karım beni zamanın yarısında yanında istiyor gibi görünmüyor çünkü sadece kız kardeşiyle konuşmakla ilgileniyor, sadece ikimiz veya bir grup arkadaşla olsun, o her zaman harika vakit geçiriyor, ben ise kız kardeşinin bu kadar uzun süre nasıl bu kadar kötü davranabildiğine hayret ederek kıvranıyorum

bu kavgaları başka şeylere bağlamaya devam ediyorum, sadece karıma ikizinden kesinlikle hoşlanmadığımı söylemek zorunda kalmamak için kız kardeşim karım ona ne kadar çok benzer davranırsa o kadar mesafeli ve mesafeli oluyorum sadece dünyaya o sözleri söylediğimde kız kardeşinin lanet bir şeytan olduğunu ve hayatımda bu zorbaya dayanamayacağımı ve onları geri alamayacağımı biliyorum bir kere bunu anladığında birlikte olamayız ailesiyle asla rahat bir şekilde uyum sağlayamayacağız çünkü kız kardeşinden nefret ediyorum

karımı seviyorum ve bunu başarmak istiyorum ama ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum bu yüzden herhangi bir tavsiye"
"Today my own best friend decided to disrespect my girlfriend, joking about how he wanted to have sex with her. I decided to talk to him one on one and when confronted about it, he ran away from the conversation (yes, literally ran). He would later come back with a power point presentation he had prepared for me (not even joking) that contained reasons as to why he was sorry.

At that time I wanted to beat him to a pulp, but I decided against it as I’m a devout Christian and not really the biggest fan of fighting (never been in a fist fight before). Was I right for doing this? Should I have beat him to a pulp?

In addition I told him we weren’t friends anymore. He tried making up excuses but I didn’t listen one bit and ghosted him.

Was I right? Should I have done something different? ","bugün en yakın arkadaşım kız arkadaşıma saygısızlık etmeye karar verdi, onunla seks yapmak istediğiyle ilgili şaka yaptı, onunla bire bir konuşmaya karar verdim ve bu konuda yüzleştiğimde konuşmadan kaçtı, evet kelimenin tam anlamıyla kaçtı, daha sonra bana hazırladığı ve neden üzgün olduğunu açıklayan bir PowerPoint sunumuyla geri döndü, şaka bile yapmıyordu

o zaman onu pataklamak istedim ama vazgeçtim çünkü dindar bir Hristiyanım ve kavganın pek de büyük bir hayranı değilim daha önce hiç yumruklu kavgaya karışmadım, bunu yapmakta haklı mıydım, onu pataklamalı mıydım

ayrıca ona artık arkadaş olmadığımızı söyledim, bahaneler uydurmaya çalıştı ama ben hiç dinlemedim ve onu görmezden geldim

haklı mıydım, farklı bir şey mi yapmalıydım"
"So like the title says, my partner(m27) kinks turn me(f20) way off.
I’ve always been a hyper sexual person &amp; when I got with my current partner that didn’t change… I have always been open about exploring since life is short but… I dunno there’s just something about his kink that I just… I dunno.

So his kink is cuckolding 🥴 I will degrade him and all that as he sees fit, but sometimes or let me say—- ALL the time he’s asking me to do it with one of his friends.
To me this is just disgusting,(not the kink itself, but the thought of taking another dude is gross to me bc im genuinely only attracted to my partner.)
idc if the dudes dick is bigger but it immediately turns me off. Ive tried explaining to him that I don’t mind the roleplay factor of it— but actually doing it is a big NO for me.

I did ONCE let him pressure me into doing it and it resulted in us arguing at the hotel because it made him sick to think about me being with another guy. 
(edit// it never happened though. He and I left the hotel after an hr bc we both didnt want it and I was crying too much. So I never did anything I didn’t want to do. We just got insanely close)
Since then, he’ll ask…but like only in the moment i guess to get turned on.
Since being with him, my libido is just so incredibly low though. I can’t even get turned on enough to flick my own bean by myself. 
and it’s only been since our big argument at that hotel. 
I will add.. When we do “do it” &amp; I am somewhat in the mood— he spends about 15-20minutes jacking off &amp; I borderline have to beg for him to do it with me. Usually by the time he’s Ig “ready” Im already uninterested.
Which makes him complain about me being wet (which in the beginning of our relationship was never an issue, but now he points out my 🐱 “isn’t much of a wap anymore”)
I don’t want to believe or think we’re sexually incompatible bc he was the first guy to make me O during penetrative sex and I am attracted to him. 

there’s a word for how I feel but it’s not coming to mind right now.
What can I do to be in the mood more? How can I get my drive back? 
I know Ive been stressed out lately so that can play a role, but for this long???
I just want to be able to enjoy being intimate with him again.
He does try for me, especially when I make a point about him taking ages to jack off while Im sitting there either roleplaying or literally doing nothing besides getting turned off more &amp; more &amp; usually the next time he won’t spend eons yanking it, but other than that it’s a vicious cycle💔
he’ll be sweet and romantic which gets me off, then he’ll go back to mentioning wanting to see me hop on his friends dick &amp; suddenly I can’t even fake moan anymore.

Any advice would be nice🥲

Edit//
I do want to add that he does turn me on- but it’s only when his kink isn’t mentioned 💔
I can occasionally get down with it, but when it’s all the time it feels like he’s no longer seeing me. He’s just full of lust and suddenly an experience just for us is ruined (bc it seems like he can ONLY get turned on by the kink)

another edit😭😭///
This timeline spans from sept-oct.
We’ve been together since April of this year and started talking in sept of 2023.
So this constantly bringing it up is a recent development, he’s mentioned it here and there in the beginning but I assume because he’s gotten more comfortable with me lately he brings it up more often.
A lot of comments have mentioned what he and I can do to either reach a compromise or how I can support him in his potential insecurities.
While different, he is human. No one deserves to be abandoned like that because of a kink or insecurity. I know I wouldn’t want to be left like that because of a possible flaw or interest I may have. ","yani başlıkta da yazdığı gibi partnerimin sapkınlıkları beni çok rahatsız ediyor
her zaman hiper cinsel bir insan oldum ve şu anki partnerimle birlikte olduğumda bu değişmedi, hayat kısa olduğu için keşfetmeye her zaman açık oldum ama bilmiyorum onun sapkınlığıyla ilgili bir şey var ki ben sadece bilmiyorum

yani onun sapkınlığı aldatmak, onu aşağılayacağım ve uygun gördüğü her şeyi yapacağım ama bazen veya her zaman arkadaşlarından biriyle yapmamı istiyor
benim için bu sadece iğrenç, sapkınlığın kendisi değil ama başka bir adamı alma düşüncesi bana iğrenç geliyor çünkü gerçekten sadece partnerime ilgi duyuyorum
adamın penisi daha büyük olsa da fark etmez ama beni hemen rahatsız ediyor ona bunun rol yapma faktörünü umursamadığımı ama gerçekten bunu yapmanın benim için büyük bir hayır olduğunu açıklamaya çalıştım

bir keresinde bana bunu yapmam için baskı yapmasına izin verdim ve bunun sonucunda otelde tartışmaya başladık çünkü başka bir adamla olmamı düşünmek onu hasta ediyordu
düzenle ama hiç olmadı, o ve ben bir hr çünkü ikimiz de istemiyorduk ve ben çok ağlıyordum bu yüzden yapmak istemediğim hiçbir şeyi yapmadım sadece çılgınca yakınlaştık
o zamandan beri cehennem soruyor ama sanırım sadece o anda tahrik olmak için
onunla birlikte olduğumdan beri libidom inanılmaz derecede düşük ama kendi başıma kendi fasulyemi çakacak kadar bile tahrik olamıyorum
ve sadece o otelde yaptığımız büyük tartışmadan beri
ekleyeceğim bunu yaptığımızda ve biraz da ruh halimdeyken o mastürbasyon yaparak dakikalar geçiriyor ve ben de benimle yapması için ona yalvarmak zorunda kalıyorum genellikle hazır olduğunda zaten ilgisiz oluyorum
bu da onu ıslak olduğumdan şikayet etmeye itiyor ki ilişkimizin başında bu hiç sorun değildi ama şimdi benim artık pek de şımarık olmadığımı söylüyor
cinsel olarak uyumsuz olduğumuza inanmak veya düşünmek istemiyorum çünkü o beni penetrasyon seks sırasında boşaltan ilk adamdı ve ona ilgi duyuyorum

hissettiğim şey için bir kelime var ama şu anda aklıma gelmiyor
ne yapabilirim daha fazla ruh halinde olmak için nasıl eski halime dönebilirim
son zamanlarda stresli olduğumu biliyorum bu yüzden bu bir rol oynayabilir ama bu kadar uzun süre
sadece onunla tekrar yakınlaşmanın tadını çıkarmak istiyorum
özellikle orada otururken mastürbasyon yapmak için çok uzun zaman harcadığını söylediğimde benim için çabalıyor ya rol yapıyor ya da kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir şey yapmıyor sadece daha fazla amp daha fazla amp genellikle bir dahaki sefere onu çekmek için çok uzun zaman harcamayacak ama bunun dışında bir kısır döngü
tatlı ve romantik olacak ki bu beni tahrik edecek sonra tekrar arkadaşının penisine binmemi istediğini söylemeye başlayacak ve aniden artık sahte inleme bile yapamıyorum

herhangi bir tavsiye güzel olurdu

düzenleme
eklemek istiyorum ki beni tahrik ediyor ama sadece sapkınlığından bahsedilmediğinde
ara sıra bununla aşağı inebiliyorum ama sürekli olduğunda artık beni görmediğini hissediyorum sadece şehvetle dolu oluyor ve aniden sadece bizim için olan bir deneyim mahvoluyor çünkü sadece sapkınlıktan tahrik olabiliyor gibi görünüyor

başka düzenle
bu zaman çizelgesi eylül ayından itibaren geçerlidir
bu yılın nisan ayından beri birlikteyiz ve eylül ayında konuşmaya başladık
bu yüzden bunu sürekli gündeme getirmesi son zamanlardaki bir gelişme. bunu başlangıçta burada ve orada dile getirdi ama sanırım son zamanlarda benimle daha rahat hale geldiği için bunu daha sık dile getiriyor
birçok yorumda onun ve benim bir uzlaşmaya varmak için neler yapabileceğimizden veya potansiyel güvensizliklerinde onu nasıl destekleyebileceğimden bahsedildi
farklı olsa da o bir insan ve kimse bir sapkınlık veya güvensizlik yüzünden böyle terk edilmeyi hak etmiyor biliyorum olası bir kusur veya ilgim yüzünden böyle bırakılmak istemezdim"

"My parents are starting to gross me out

I (14f) have felt very uncomfortable around my parents over the past month. This all started when I was about 12 i caught my parents having sex downstairs at midnight. I saw what was going on, turned around and went back to bed. We never spoke about it, which I didn’t mind because that’s be a very awkward convo. A year later I was coming upstairs to my room when I heard my mother moaning, again I just turned around and left. It didn’t bother me much until lately where it’s basically all the time. My father makes sexual jokes all the time that he thinks I don’t notice (which I kinda find gross because why would you do that near your kid). They sometimes do it in their room (which is right next to mine) even though they know the walls are thin and I can hear them clearly (it’s so bad that I hear it in my head all the time and I can’t stop it). Again none of it bothered me because it’s none of my business and people have needs, until lately. 90% of the time I decide to go downstairs they are either doing it or watching a series that all the characters do is have sex, due to my age sex grosses me out and I’ve made hints to my parents about it. Yesterday was my grandmas birthday but due to weather we couldn’t go see her. The family decided to visit her today around 1pm, I told my mother to tell me when the are ready to go so we could leave. I didn’t expect them to be ready exactly at that time so I gave them 45mins and no sound of them moving or getting ready. I went downstairs to check about 20 minutes ago, saw them having sex. My mother and I locked eyes, I shook my head and sighed and went back upstairs. I’m writing this post hoping for advice on what to do, still waiting to leave to see my grandma.","annem ve babam beni iğrendirmeye başlıyor

"Hi, so I got into work today and people were laughing at me when I walked in because I didn’t come in uniform - I had to change in the locker room.

"I posted this on another subreddit, but I believe this is a better place for it and the questions I want to ask. Throwaway for keeping my personal life personal.

I (16M) had a son with one of the girls at my school (18F, then 17). She decided (with her family’s support) that she didn’t want him and left him to me. I hold nothing against her for this, I understand where she’s coming from.

The second I set my eyes on my baby, I loved him. He was my world. He was immediately the most precious thing on this planet to me. Everything about him was absolutely perfect. His eyes are gorgeous. He’s the most wonderful thing on this earth, and I tried to name him accordingly. I think I did a pretty good job, but I won’t share it for privacy’s sake. I couldn’t wait to see him grow up. I couldn’t wait to be there for everything.

Unfortunately, it wasn’t long until reality hit. My older brother (24M) pointed out that we weren’t in a position to raise him. Neither of us knew anything about babies. Children were expensive. We wouldn’t be able to watch over him unless I dropped out of school, which was thrown off the table the second I suggested it. We wouldn’t be able to give him the life I knew he deserved. We don’t have any family to leave him with. Our mom has been dead for about a year and a half. We never knew our father(s?). Our grandparents had our mother at an old age, they’re both in a nursing home now. They wouldn’t be able to help if they wanted to.

The longest drive I’ve ever sat through was the drive to give him up. I know it was for the best, but it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. I literally had never felt that kind of pain before. I hated it. I loved him. I sobbed. I wouldn’t have made it through in one piece if my brother wasn’t there.

The new parents told me that I’d be allowed to visit. I suggested a couple dates. I wasn’t sure how much space I needed to give them so I gave them days at least 3 months from then. Each one was shot down. I asked if they had any days that were good for them. They ghosted me on that.

They’ve since renamed him (a variation of the ‘-ayden’ names). I found out from Insta, they gave me their account names so I could see photos of him. I don’t know why I’m so upset. He’s their kid now. I’m the one who gave him up. I was the one who was irresponsible. I’m not the one he’ll be calling ‘Dad’. But I can’t get it out of my head. That was the one thing I thought he’d always have from me.

I’ve been thinking about him constantly. There’s not a day that goes by without me wondering how he’s doing. If he’s happy. If he’s healthy. If he’s loved.

It’s been rough. Before today, I found comfort in the fact that at least he was only fifteen minutes away. If I asked every so often, I might of finally been allowed to visit.

Today the adoptive mother put on her story that they were packing up to move across the country. I feel destroyed.

Am I being overdramatic? This is my own fault. How am I supposed to move on from this?

UPDATE: Thank you for all of your responses. I wasn’t expecting all of them to come in this quickly, and I’m touched so many of you took time out of your day to give me advice and/or give me support.

There is a follow-up to this post sooner than I thought. The adoptive mother might’ve seen me view her story yesterday, maybe not. Whatever it was, she got in contact with me this evening. I sat down with my brother and went through it all with him.

She told me herself that they were moving to be closer to her family, giving me the name of the town. She promised me that she and her husband would take care of my son and love him like their own. They’ve wanted to be parents for years now, but were unable to have a child themselves. She promised he’d go to a good college, that he’ll be happy, and that she’ll make sure he grows up to be a good person. I hope she keeps those promises. That’s everything I ever wanted for my baby, especially the latter two.

There is no way for me to legally dispute this. I looked at the papers. My brother did. My brother’s friends did.

She told me they talked it over a little more and didn’t want him to know he was adopted. She told me they didn’t want him to feel unwanted or unloved, or develop any kind of self-esteem issues from it through childhood. There was a possibility they might come clean one day, and for that they want me to make a letter to give him to “ease the blow.” I’ll hand it over when I go to see them and my boy in a couple days, they’ve agreed on a date to let me visit him before the move.

She told me I could keep following them on Insta for photos of him. Otherwise, they want me to keep a very low radar. No texts, maybe a call every year or so (it can’t be too personal, it has to be one of those ‘family friend he’s never met’ calls), no birthday gifts, etc.

They’ll adore him. I know that. I don’t like that they’re moving or that I haven’t been given a date to visit before today, but they’re genuinely good people. He’s going to have more than I ever could’ve given him.

Thanks for all the advice. I’ll be doing the letters and savings account for sure. I know I’ll see him again one day, at least when he’s 18. I know I’ll always love him as my son. I know I might not know-know him well by the time I see him again, but I’ll make sure to put effort into catching up. If he wants it, that is.

Until then, I’ll try to work on myself. I know I’ll miss him, there’s no changing that, but there’s no changing his absence either. I’ll do my best to be someone he could be proud of.

And someone who doesn’t end up in another teenage pregnancy situation. I love the fact that he’s on this earth, but… Yeah, that’s not happening again. ","i posted this on another subreddit but i believe this is a better place for it and the questions i want to ask throwaway for keeping my personal life personal

i m had a son with one of the girls at my school f then  she decided with her familys support that she didnt want him and left him to me i hold nothing against her for this i understand where shes coming from

the second i set my eyes on my baby i loved him he was my world he was immediately the most precious thing on this planet to me everything about him was absolutely perfect his eyes are gorgeous hes the most wonderful thing on this earth and i tried to name him accordingly i think i did a pretty good job but i wont share it for privacys sake i couldnt wait to see him grow up i couldnt wait to be there for everything

unfortunately it wasnt long until reality hit my older brother m pointed out that we werent in a position to raise him neither of us knew anything about babies children were expensive we wouldnt be able to watch over him unless i dropped out of school which was thrown off the table the second i suggested it we wouldnt be able to give him the life i knew he deserved we dont have any family to leave him with our mom has been dead for about a year and a half we never knew our fathers our grandparents had our mother at an old age theyre both in a nursing home now they wouldnt be able to help if they wanted to

the longest drive ive ever sat through was the drive to give him up i know it was for the best but it was the hardest thing ive ever done in my life i literally had never felt that kind of pain before i hated it i loved him i sobbed i wouldnt have made it through in one piece if my brother wasnt there

the new parents told me that id be allowed to visit i suggested a couple dates i wasnt sure how much space i needed to give them so i gave them days at least  months from then each one was shot down i asked if they had any days that were good for them they ghosted me on that

theyve since renamed him a variation of the ayden names i found out from insta they gave me their account names so i could see photos of him i dont know why im so upset hes their kid now im the one who gave him up i was the one who was irresponsible im not the one hell be calling dad but i cant get it out of my head that was the one thing i thought hed always have from me

ive been thinking about him constantly theres not a day that goes by without me wondering how hes doing if hes happy if hes healthy if hes loved

its been rough before today i found comfort in the fact that at least he was only fifteen minutes away if i asked every so often i might of finally been allowed to visit

today the adoptive mother put on her story that they were packing up to move across the country i feel destroyed

am i being overdramatic this is my own fault how am i supposed to move on from this

update thank you for all of your responses i wasnt expecting all of them to come in this quickly and im touched so many of you took time out of your day to give me advice andor give me support

there is a followup to this post sooner than i thought the adoptive mother mightve seen me view her story yesterday maybe not whatever it was she got in contact with me this evening i sat down with my brother and went through it all with him

she told me herself that they were moving to be closer to her family giving me the name of the town she promised me that she and her husband would take care of my son and love him like their own theyve wanted to be parents for years now but were unable to have a child themselves she promised hed go to a good college that hell be happy and that shell make sure he grows up to be a good person i hope she keeps those promises thats everything i ever wanted for my baby especially the latter two

there is no way for me to legally dispute this i looked at the papers my brother did my brothers friends did

she told me they talked it over a little more and didnt want him to know he was adopted she told me they didnt want him to feel unwanted or unloved or develop any kind of selfesteem issues from it through childhood there was a possibility they might come clean one day and for that they want me to make a letter to give him to ease the blow ill hand it over when i go to see them and my boy in a couple days theyve agreed on a date to let me visit him before the move

she told me i could keep following them on insta for photos of him otherwise they want me to keep a very low radar no texts maybe a call every year or so it cant be too personal it has to be one of those family friend hes never met calls no birthday gifts etc

theyll adore him i know that i dont like that theyre moving or that i havent been given a date to visit before today but theyre genuinely good people hes going to have more than i ever couldve given him

thanks for all the advice ill be doing the letters and savings account for sure i know ill see him again one day at least when hes  i know ill always onu oğlum olarak seviyorum biliyorum onu ​​tekrar gördüğümde onu iyi tanımayabilirim ama eğer isterse yetişmek için çaba göstereceğim tabii ki

o zamana kadar kendim üzerinde çalışmaya çalışacağım onu ​​özlediğimi biliyorum bunu değiştirmenin bir yolu yok ama onun yokluğunu da değiştirmenin bir yolu yok onun gurur duyabileceği biri olmak için elimden geleni yapacağım

ve bir başka genç hamilelik durumuyla sonuçlanmayacak biri onun bu dünyada olması gerçeğini seviyorum ama evet bu bir daha olmayacak"
"Me (M23), them (F22). 

I booked my train tickets in advance to see her, I got her gift bag ready, I have had a hard week at work/looking after my dad, she says this Tuesday gone she is looking forward to seeing me. 

So I go down to her place, I wait outside and tell her I’m outside (side note, I have told her in advance I’ll be coming half one). I was at least 15 minutes late (my bad). But, my train was delayed so I came in at a later time. 

So, I’m waiting outside and she replies (paraphrased text) 

“I’m not there 😂 sorry. I’m with my sibling rn xxxxxxxdxxdx”

I was upset. She told me that short notice at around the time I was suppose to meet her. I was upset but I said “okay, what time you back? Xxx”

Since 13:45 yesterday, up till now, I’m writing all this by myself in a hotel room. I’ve texted, I called throughout yesterday but still no response. I was alone in a different city, having to feel neglected and abandoned.  

I ate alone, I went to the cinema alone, I had to fork out money for a one night hotel because it was night time. I felt so upset and heartbroken. Hell I was slipping back into my porn addiction (I admitted this to her in text, still waiting on a response).

And even still, she isn’t picking up….. 

What’s happening? It’s not fair, I plan everything in advance and she just changes plans. All I wanted was a time so I can hold on to the hope she will tell me what happened. 

I get it she has dsylexia and adhd but c’mon…..she didn’t even read my texts from Wednesday-Friday, building up to seeing her….

He never answers my messages and I'm lucky enough to get cuddled at night for five minutes. I stayed one night with my mom this week and he accused me of cheating while I was there.

I am a father of two kids 12 and 16 that were primarily living with their mother for the last 8 years. We were married in the past and after the divorce she got primary custody. We did not vaccinate the kids as babies or younger children because mother is opposed to vaccines. I wanted them vaccinated since birth, but she was opposed so my options were happy wife, happy life, or forcibly vaccinate them and have to deal with the fallout. I did not pursue the path of vaccination at the time and the kids have still not been vaccinated.

I have, in the last month, gained sole custody of both children with full medical decision making/legal decision making due to mistakes on mother's part. A judge has identified abuse/neglect and I have full/sole custody now. The judge wants them vaccinated, I want them vaccinated, but the kids were home-schooled and have been told vaccines cause autism, have bad chemicals, etc... All the standard anti-vax rhetoric. They also have the mindset that, if everyone else is vaccinated why do I need to be vaccinated?

I promised the kids I would get at least two pediatrician opinions if vaccines are safe and a good idea. We went to one pediatrician and they obviously said yes, get vaccines. The kids are still heavily opposed to vaccines because they have been lied to about the side effects from their mother. We have a second pediatrician appointment and they will be getting vaccinated at that appointment.

Is there any content I can show them that would help to reinforce the importance of vaccines and help to deprogram their belief that vaccines are a bad thing?

Also, what is the best way to explain to them that vaccines are important?","güncelleme httpswwwredditcomradvicecommentsddogzvupdategainedcustodyofantivaxkidshttpswwwredditcomradvicecommentsddogzvupdategainedcustodyofantivaxkids

I asked her if she could talk to her mom and ask her about getting her some birth control pills. She said her mom said that she’s not even allowed to kiss her boyfriend. So anyways she won’t talk to her mom. And she doesn’t feel comfortable talking to her dad either.

"My ex and I have not spoken in over 10 years, we had a very bad break up. He had a lot of mental health issues, stole from me, disappeared for weeks at a time, and things were just generally bad. He broke up with me after he ended up in the hospital crashing his car drunk and basically told me he wasted 3 years just settling with me. Lots of bad memories there. I truly loved him, don't ask me why, but it took me many many years to get over him and things that happened.

I recently re-activated my facebook after many years and saw he had gotten married and seemed to have turned his life around completely. We were still on each other's friends lists when I de-activated. Shortly after I returned to fb, he removed me within a few days and blocked me entirely. Okay, no problem. Again, haven't spoken to him in a decade.

Yesterday I received an fb message request from his now wife. They seem to have been together for 6 years, judging by her first profile pic with him in it. The message reads as follows:

Hello,  
I am reaching out regarding the photos you still have of Ex'sName. He saw you pop up a few days ago on his timeline and felt it best to remove you for personal reasons. He felt uncomfortable seeing you still had romantic photos of the two of you still up from that time period. He did not wish to open the door to contact you, so I offered to do so instead. He is kindly asking that you please remove such photos as it has been a long time and given the nature of your relationship, he does not wish to continue to be associated with that time. Thanks.

 A part of me felt a bit indignant that he was asking this of me and also sending his wife to do so. I responded with this:

Hello Name,  
I am sorry to hear about ExName's feelings and saw he blocked me so he does not have to interact or see my content. At this time, I do not wish to remove any photos as they are my own memories and I will do so if and when the time comes that I feel it is appropriate. I wish the two of you much happiness.

Today she responded and it left me floored. Her response:

So you're just going to keep a bunch of photos of someone who you basically groomed and took advantage of? Seriously? Please just move the fuck on. You are a middle aged woman clinging to a relationship from a decade ago with a man 12 years your junior who clearly had issues. If the roles were reversed and a 33 year old man had 'dated' a 21 year old girl with addiction and mental health problems everyone would rightfully call it out as predatory. The fact you wont delete the photos even at his own request is frankly disgusting. What memories even? He told me the whole story and I question your sanity and own mental health issues at the time considering the fact you kept begging him to come back despite knowing he didn't want to be with you. Please just do the right thing and delete them.

I am honestly taken aback by this. We had a large age difference but he chatted me up first and was very active in our relationship. I never once ""took advantage"" of him. He stole money from me, jewelry, stole from my family. Yes I kept asking for him to come back, because I was deeply in love with him at the time. But when it ended, I didn't pursue it further.

How do I respond to this? I don't know what the right thing to do in this situation is. I feel it is wrong that they dictate what I have up on my social media and this narrative is quite twisted. I have no one to reach out to about this, my family definitely did not approve of him and I don't want to re-open that can of worms by bringing this up. Advice welcome!

TLDR - After a decade of not speaking to my ex, who I had a very tumultuous relationship with, his wife reached out to me on facebook to ask me to remove his photos (per his request). After I responded to her message and said I did not wish to at the time, as they were still memories I had, she sent a nasty accusing message to me. I don't know how or if I should respond to her and what the right move is with the photos. Need advice on how to proceed.","eski sevgilimle yıllardır konuşmuyoruz çok kötü bir ayrılık yaşadık çok fazla ruh sağlığı sorunu vardı benden çaldı haftalarca ortadan kayboldu ve her şey genel olarak kötüydü hastanede arabasını çarpıp sarhoş olduktan sonra benimle ayrıldı ve bana sadece benimle yetinerek yıllarını boşa harcadığını söyledi orada çok kötü anılarım var onu gerçekten çok sevdim nedenini sormayın ama onu ve olan biteni atlatmam çok çok yıllarımı aldı

merhaba isim
exname'in duygularını duyduğum için üzgünüm ve beni engellediğini gördüm, bu yüzden şu anda etkileşimde bulunmak veya içeriklerimi görmek zorunda değil, kendi anılarım oldukları için hiçbir fotoğrafı kaldırmak istemiyorum ve uygun olduğunu düşündüğümde bunu yapacağım, ikinize de bol mutluluklar diliyorum

Açıkçası bu beni şaşırttı, aramızda büyük bir yaş farkı vardı ama o önce benimle sohbet etti ve ilişkimizde çok aktifti, ondan bir kez bile faydalanmadım, benden para çaldı, ailemden mücevher çaldı, evet, o zamanlar ona çok aşık olduğum için geri dönmesini istemeye devam ettim ama bittiğinde daha fazla uğraşmadım

Buna nasıl cevap vermeliyim, bu durumda ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, sosyal medyada ne paylaştığımı onların belirlemesinin yanlış olduğunu düşünüyorum medya ve bu anlatı oldukça çarpık bu konuda ulaşabileceğim kimse yok ailem kesinlikle onu onaylamadı ve bunu gündeme getirerek bu solucan kutusunu tekrar açmak istemiyorum tavsiye hoş geldiniz

Last night was the first time we were getting frisky in our relationship, one thing lead to another which eventually lead to s*x.

"15 years ago I left my family in my rear view and never looked back. 

When I was 19 I was with my high school sweetheart K (34). Me and K were inseparable. She was my first everything. My first love, my first kiss, my first sexual partner, my first everything. We had talked about everything from marriage, to kids, what names we were going to give our kids, to buying house, to buying car, etc… then one day it my life changed for the worst.

My brother J (33) and I were never close. We had our brother moments such as fighting for each other as in if you messed with him you messed with me and vice versa but that was pretty much the end of our relationship.

When I was 19 and still living at my parents place, I went to K’s house after work and noticed J’s car in the driveway. I walked in and there was my girlfriend and my brother having sex on her couch. They saw me and J tried to explain but I just turned around and left. She followed me and tried to explain but there was no way she could explain the betrayal. I then left and went home. I got home and my parents saw my face and asked what happened and I told them and they repaoens with “So you found out?” Turns out J and K have been having sex for a whole year and my family knew about it and no one told me. 

I screamed at my parents at the betrayal and my sister (CC) came downstairs and asked what happened. Through tears I told her and she tore my parents a new one. J and K through the door trying to explain and my sister threatened K and then she punched J in the stomach. I went upstairs packed up 3 suitcases as K was trying to talk to me, left and stayed with my grandparents for two years in a different state.

While in the different state I met my wife (M) she pulled me back together and restored my trust in people. She had a crush on me for a while and it was reciprocated but I was reluctant to get back in a relationship cause of my previous one and I told her this and she promised that she would never betray me like that and so far she hasn’t lied. We got married when I was 24, had our first child at 25, first house at 25 as well, second and third at 27 twins, 3rd at 30.

I asked her about this and she said whatever decision I decided she would be behind me. But I don’t know what I should do because my family betrayed me. They betrayed my trust and chose sides. It hurt more then anything. My sister agrees with me but she says that enough time has passed and that I faired better because my brother and K got married and now live with my parents because they have no money.

What should I do? Should I forgive but never forget or just forget them altogether.","Yıllar önce ailemi arkamda bıraktım ve asla geriye bakmadım

"I found out tonight that my parents at the age of 40 inherited $400k and an additional $100k for each of their children, two total, myself and my my sister at a total sum of $600k. We were 13 and 11 when our parents received this money, my sister and I were supposed to have our inheritance put into trusts or maybe they were and our parents were the trustees but in any case neither my sister nor myself had ever heard about any of this money until tonight. I'm 35 and she's 33. Apparently this money was all spent and lost within two or three years, from bad investments to failed businesses they burned through their inheritances as well as both my sister's and myselfs. My aunt told about this tonight, as she didn't even realize she was dropping  a bomb on me. Apparently all of my grandfather's children received $400k plus an additional $100k per child which all of my cousins received as directed. My sister and I are the only ones who didn't get their inheritances, and we didn't even know about them. I actually haven't said anything to my sister yet, I haven't said anything to anyone except my wife. I don't know what to do here. The money was gone before I was even old enough to get it.

after we started dating;

Fast forward and at a party, he was a little drunk and they kissed for a while. He says he doesn’t know why and how it happened. I have asked about the conversation and context but he says he doesn’t remember and often gets overwhelmed when questioned about it.  I have been so bothered by the ‘why’ of it all. I have chosen to forgive but I can’t seem to forget at all. I sometimes have images and nightmares about it all. It comes back to haunt me every few months or so.

The worst part is he wants me to meet all his friends and I feel very weird about that. Since they all know and are good friends with both parties. I don’t know how to get over it, the comparisons and the hurt to the self-worth.

"Someone I knew was watching her for a day. When I went back to get my dog, there was no answer at the door. I was unable to get in contact with them for over a month, and by the time I did get in contact I was told he had been arrested with my dog and that she (my dog) was taken by the police. He told me that he had no idea what happened to her after that. 

I made phone calls to the Chicago Police Department and surrounding shelters trying to track her down, but I had no luck. I was devastated and I didn’t know what to do.

I was skeptical of the story of her being taken by the police since there was no record of what had happened and their behavior in the situation was strange. I spent the next year trying to talk to mutual friends of ours to figure out what had happened to her. During this time I gained bits and pieces of information leading me to where she is now and the family that she is with. I finally have the address of where she is being kept, and I want her back. 

I have my paperwork from her vet with my name on it because she is legally my dog. Her microchip is also registered to me.

"I'm 24, and my uncle (58) has been battling leukemia for the past year. He's now at a stage where he needs a bone marrow transplant. My mom got tested, but unfortunately, she wasn’t a match. A few days ago, she asked me to get tested to see if I could be a potential donor. I immediately felt uneasy about it and told her I wasn’t comfortable with the idea. The truth is, I've never had a good relationship with my uncle. He’s always been harsh and critical, especially toward my dad, who he’s treated terribly for as long as I can remember. On top of that, he’s a heavy drinker, and I can’t help but feel conflicted about going through with something so serious for someone who hasn’t been the greatest person.

My mom was really hurt by my refusal, and now she and other family members are guilt-tripping me, saying I should do it for the sake of the family. But deep down, I just don’t want to, and I’m struggling with how to explain this to my mom without coming off as heartless. How do I tell her 'no' in a way that shows I care, but that I'm just not willing to go through with this?","ben ve amcam son bir yıldır lösemi ile mücadele ediyoruz artık kemik iliği nakline ihtiyacı var annem test yaptırdı ama maalesef uygun çıkmadı birkaç gün önce potansiyel bir donör olup olamayacağımı görmek için test yaptırmamı istedi hemen bundan rahatsız oldum ve ona bu fikirden rahatsız olduğumu söyledim gerçek şu ki amcamla hiç iyi bir ilişkim olmadı o her zaman sert ve eleştireldi özellikle babama karşı hatırladığım kadarıyla çok kötü davrandı ayrıca çok içiyor ve en iyi insan olmayan biri için bu kadar ciddi bir şey yapmak konusunda çelişkili hissetmekten kendimi alamıyorum

"So I (34m) have been seeing this woman (29f) for like a month, we met online and hit it off, she lives in the next city over and we’ve seen each other every weekend for the past four weeks or so and message every day. 

For context I’ve been single for about 2 years after my partner of ten years decided to leave and return to her country of origin, and I’m not gunna lie it fucked me up and I’ve struggled with women since then. 

Anyways me and this woman have hit it off pretty well, we get on she’s really easy to be around, we laugh, the chat is good, the sex is good, everything’s good.. the only issue was my trauma, she’s also from another country originally and I’ve been struggling with the idea that if I get too attached she might leave like the last one and break me again, but I decided to push through it because we clicked. 

Then last weekend she told me she has herpes, we’ve always used a condom and it isn’t active/she hasn’t had a flare up since she caught it 2 years ago, so I’m not worried that I’ve caught it. However, it has seriously thrown me, when she told me I said I didn’t mind because I didn’t want that to ruin what seemed to be developing between us, but now that I’ve had a few days to think it over I don’t know what to do. I like her, I haven’t felt that at ease and open with anyone for a long time, and I want to try to move on with my life and meet someone new to make a family etc.. 
But I don’t want herpes, and the idea that I could never have unprotected sex with her (meaning no kids which I have always wanted) is a major problem for me. Even worse is the idea that she could give me herpes and then leave me broken and infected with a lifelong disease. It’s been really tough getting myself out there and meeting new people and it would be 100 times harder with herpes.. 

I’m looking for advice, what would other people do? would this be a dealbreaker for others? And if I do decide to leave it here, how do I end it in a way that she won’t feel tainted or disgusting, she’s lovely and the circumstances of her catching it are really unfortunate, I don’t want to hurt her or make her feel worthless.

sonra geçen hafta sonu bana herpes olduğunu söyledi, her zaman prezervatif kullandık ve aktif değildi, yıllar önce kaptığından beri bir alevlenme yaşamadı, bu yüzden kapmış olmam beni endişelendirmiyor, ancak bana kapmadığımı söylediğinde beni ciddi şekilde sarstı aklım karıştı çünkü aramızda gelişen şeyi mahvetmesini istemedim ama şimdi düşünmek için birkaç günüm var ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum ondan hoşlanıyorum uzun zamandır kimseye karşı rahat ve açık hissetmedim ve hayatıma devam etmek ve bir aile kurmak için yeni biriyle tanışmak istiyorum
ama herpes istemiyorum ve onunla asla korunmasız seks yapamayacağım fikri yani her zaman istediğim gibi çocuk sahibi olamamak benim için büyük bir sorun daha da kötüsü bana herpes bulaştırabileceği ve sonra beni kırık ve ömür boyu sürecek bir hastalıkla enfekte bırakabileceği fikri kendimi ortaya atmak ve yeni insanlarla tanışmak gerçekten zordu ve herpes ile çok daha zor olurdu

She wants to wait for sex which I agree with, this is both our first times doing anything and everything intimate and I’m not sure if either of us are ready yet.

Then after I cum and it only gets on her hands she gets scared it’s on the sheets. Or even when I wash a blanket it did get on she’s scared it will still some how he sterile.

"Using throwaway account because she knows my real one. 

So, I(28 m) and my girl(26f) have been together a little over a year and six months. We've had normal sex most of it, nothing crazy. She always gets real tired after a couple rounds though when I don't, I like going a bit longer but she winds up falling asleep and I didn't want to do her like that. 

But then a couple months ago, we were talking about it a bit, joking around a little when she told me I could just do her while she slept. 

I felt off about it. It's kind of weird doing a motionless, helpless body. It feels a bit rapey. Even if she has given me permission multiple times since the first mention. A few of those times as she was settling to fall asleep afterwards. 

I don't even know if I want to try it. I know she's giving me permission. She's even me told me that she would like it. ""Knowing I'd be able to please you even while asleep, it's kind of nice."" Some words she said a couple days ago trying to convince me. 

I still feel off about it. I kind of want to try it just to please her, maybe just once. But it still feels weird to think about.

I'm worried she might wake up and decide I was weird for going through with it too. She told me she's thought about it since her second (ex)boyfriend but has never actually done it before. So I'm worried she'll not actually like the idea and something will go horribly wrong... Maybe I'm worrying too much? I don't know.

I'm very lost.

She asks me every so often to tell her stories about him. What made me fall in love with him? Do you think he would like me now? Are there videos of us together? And so many more. Well today she told me she had a dream last night and it felt so real. Then she proceeded to ask me if I think he went to heaven, was I with him, was he in the hospital, and what his last words were. He wasn't in the hospital and I don't know what his last words were because I wasn't with him. We weren't together anymore. Split up about 9 months before (didn't divorce). She was also asking me about the woods and his sister being with him. That's where he was found. I don't remember saying anything about the woods, unless I said it when she was younger and forgot.

I can’t think straight. This girl is an actual little angel and the thought of some POS kid hurting her kills me. She could’ve landed wrong, she could’ve broke worse, she could’ve died.

"TW: Mention of SA

I (22, F) am getting married to my Husband (Jay, 24, M) in October. We have 6 people in our wedding party. One of them, let’s call her Courtney (24,F) is one of our members of our wedding party. Courtney has a Boyfriend, Kevin (M,23) of 4 months. Courtney lives with 2 other of my bridesmaids and they’re all roommates. Courtney has been a good friend of mine for about 5 years. Courtney has never been good with financial stuff, but I chose to overlook it when putting her in my wedding party, as I didn’t care about dropping $80 on a dress for her or whatever. 
    Thats until our mutual friend, Lyla (23, F, Another one of my Bridesmaids) got married in May. Courtney was one of her bridesmaids as well. Lyla ended up spending $400 on Courtney just on things for the wedding/travel/etc for the wedding and was never paid her back. Lyla wasn’t worried about it, until one of Courtneys roommates was like “Hey, did Court send you that money? She’s saying she can’t pay rent this month because she sent you money?”. Courtney never sent Lyla any money.
    

Another big factor in why I’m thinking of doing this is Kevin, Courtneys Boyfriend. I’ve met Kevin 3 times. One of the times, he acted super weird and creepy around me and another mutual friend at a party, where both the friend and I were intoxicated and he was not. I was scared to bring this to her attention, so my dear husband told her, as they are also close. She started crying and saying she “Wanted to believe me, but Kevin is her boyfriend.”. 
   A week passes and although I’m upset, I drop it. I celebrated a big milestone achievement and all my friends came and had a surprise party for me to celebrate. I found out after I left, Courtney had gone to mutual friends of ours and told them I was “lying about the Kevin stuff for attention and to seem like I had been SA’ed.”. When I found this out I was so shocked, then livid, then sad. I grieved our whole friendship because of her actions. My Dear Husband is livid and told me he didn’t think he could hang out with her anymore, and I have to agree.
   All this to now add, she A) didn’t end up showing up to my bachelorette I had planned for months (in which I told her I’d pay for her food and board and stuff), and B) her roommates have now informed me she owes them for 3 months rent + over $1k worth of stuff. 
  I’m terrible at confronting people as I’m shy, but I know I need to confront her. Any advice?
Edit: I also forgot to mention, that Courtney asked Lyla and I for rent money during Lyla’s wedding. She asked us for $800 and we have come to learn her rent is $500.



UPDATE ONE: I’ve arranged to talk in person to Courtney today. Thank you for everyones advice, I’ll try to update how it goes 



UPDATE TWO:
So, last week I talked with her. She broke down crying saying she had never talked about me and that she really wanted to still be in our wedding. Feeling a bit manipulated, I let her. I know, I’m a soft person.
But, over this weekend, I found out she was continuing to talk bad about Jay and I from multiple people. I also found out that she never ordered her dress and wouldn’t until late September (my wedding is in mid October. It takes like 3-4 weeks for a dress from this place to come in). I was so nervous about what to do I made myself sick. Jay finally had enough and told her she was out of the wedding party. She now is saying that she’ll attend the wedding and bring Kevin. Even though we never gave her the go ahead to do so. I’m sure there will be future updates to this as I’m tired of this witch with a B.","tw sa'dan bahsediliyor

ekim ayında kocam jay m ile evleniyorum, düğünümüzde insanlar var, bunlardan biri ona courtney f diyelim, düğünümüzdeki üyelerden biri courtney'nin aylardır erkek arkadaşı kevin m var courtney diğer nedimelerimle yaşıyor ve hepsi oda arkadaşı courtney yaklaşık yıllardır iyi bir arkadaşım courtney finansal konularda hiç iyi olmadı ama onu düğün partimize dahil ederken bunu görmezden gelmeyi seçtim çünkü ona bir elbise almak umrumda değildi
ta ki ortak arkadaşımız lyla f nedimelerimden biri mayıs ayında evlenene kadar courtney de onun nedimelerinden biriydi lyla sonunda courtney'e sadece düğün seyahat vb. şeyler için para harcadı ve bu para ona hiç ödenmedi lyla bundan hiç endişe etmedi ta ki courtney'nin oda arkadaşlarından biri, hey court sana o parayı gönderdi mi, sana para gönderdiği için bu ay kirayı ödeyemeyeceğini söyleyene kadar courtney lyla'ya hiç para göndermedi

bir diğer büyük etken bunu yapmayı neden düşünüyorum kevin courtney'nin erkek arkadaşı kevinle bir kere tanıştım bir partide hem ben hem de arkadaşım sarhoşken onun sarhoş olmamasına rağmen bana ve başka bir ortak arkadaşa karşı çok garip ve ürkütücü davrandı bunu onun dikkatini çekmekten korktum bu yüzden sevgili kocam ona söyledi çünkü onlar da yakındı ağlamaya başladı ve bana inanmak istediğini söyledi ama kevin onun erkek arkadaşı
bir hafta geçti ve üzgün olmama rağmen bıraktım büyük bir dönüm noktasını kutladım ve tüm arkadaşlarım gelip benim için kutlamak üzere sürpriz bir parti düzenlediler courtney'den ayrıldıktan sonra ortak arkadaşlarımıza gidip onlara kevin olayı hakkında ilgi çekmek ve söylenmiş gibi görünmek için yalan söylediğimi söylediğini öğrendim bunu öğrendiğimde çok şok oldum sonra öfkelendim sonra üzüldüm onun davranışları yüzünden tüm arkadaşlığımız için üzüldüm sevgili kocam öfkelendi ve bana artık onunla takılamayacağını söyledi ve ben de buna katılmak zorundayım
tüm bunlara ek olarak aylardır planladığım bekarlığa veda partisine gelmedi ve ona ödeme yapacağımı söyledim yemeği, pansiyonu ve diğer eşyaları için ve b oda arkadaşları bana aylarca kira borcu olduğunu ve bunun değerinden fazla eşyası olduğunu söylediler
utangaç olduğum için insanlarla yüzleşmekte çok kötüyüm ama onunla yüzleşmem gerektiğini biliyorum herhangi bir tavsiyeniz var mı
düzenleme ayrıca courtney'nin lyla'nın düğünü sırasında lyla ve benden kira parası istediğini söylemeyi unuttum ve kirasının 

birinci güncelleme bugün courtney ile şahsen görüşmeyi ayarladım herkesin tavsiyesi için teşekkür ederim nasıl gittiğini güncellemeye çalışacağım

ikinci güncelleme
geçtiğimiz hafta onunla konuştuğumda ağlayarak benden hiç bahsetmediğini ve düğünümüzde olmaya devam etmek istediğini söyledi biraz manipüle edildiğini hissetti ona yumuşak bir insan olduğumu söyledim
ama bu hafta sonu jay ve benim hakkımda birçok kişiden kötü konuşmaya devam ettiğini öğrendim ayrıca elbisesini hiç sipariş etmediğini ve eylül sonuna kadar sipariş etmeyeceğini öğrendim düğünüm ekim ortasında burada bir elbisenin gelmesi haftalar sürüyor ne yapacağımı bilemediğim için kendimi hasta ettim jay sonunda dayanamamıştı ve ona düğün partisinden ayrıldığını söyledi, şimdi düğüne katılacağını ve Kevin'i getireceğini söylüyor, ona bunu yapması için hiçbir zaman onay vermemiş olmamıza rağmen, eminim ki bu konuda gelecekte güncellemeler olacak çünkü bu cadıdan bıktım"
"My (24f) friend (24m) has been making inappropriate sexual comments about me for years and I've just let it slide but he really took the piss tonight and I can't hold my tongue anymore. He makes comments about my breasts and says if I wasn't in a relationship we'd have had sex by now. He is not my type, never has been, and I've made it very clear we're just friends but he won't stop.                   
Tonight he asked me to pretend to be his gf and when I said no he told me to stop being a killjoy. He made many comments about how I was dressing up for him by wearing a low cut top (I was literally in my work clothes and my shirt was not low cut at all). He then tried to pressure me into going out clubbing just the two of us and wouldn't take no for an answer. I told him I was leaving in a minute and went to the bathroom but when I got back he had bought 4 more drinks and said I was a pussy if I didn't finish the 2 he got for me. I said no and that he shouldn't have bought them as I said I wanted to leave but then he said he wouldn't leave with me unless I finished them (I don't get taxis alone at night). I downed them and said I was leaving, he then acted really pissy in the car ride home and kept trying to get me to come back to his ""to see where the night takes us"". I got out of the taxi early and walked the rest of the way home. He sees no problem with his behaviour and keeps saying I'm flirting with him when I'm literally just talking to him.                      
I'm sick of it and it makes me not want to be friends with him anymore but we've been friends since we were like 10 and I don't want to throw away a lifelong friendship. I told the other friends in our group and they all think I need to talk to him about it but I don't even know where to start.

She kept saying: ""how would you react if I all of a sudden shaved my head or made a tattoo on my arm without me telling you?""

Is she right? Well, I guess it doesn't matter now because I already shaved my beard. but I'm just not sure if I should grow it back or keep shaving.

"EDIT:I just wanna say a big thank you to all the sweet women that are mothers,women who are not mothers yet,girls,boys,men,whatever that gave me such sweet and profound adviceI read all your comments and found a lot of helpful advice,you are all greatly appreciated. ❤️
On another note for the people commenting my age,my living situation,my finances and job,you know nothing about me or the things I have been through.Shame on you for attacking someone that's just asking for advice.

I (27f) recently started going out with a boy a year younger than me, and I wanted to keep it private, but she saw him pick me up with his car one day, and I was forced into telling her. Anyway, she was accepting at first, but when I'm sometimes over at his house, she would start texting me, ""Come home already"" or ""When will you be coming home? "" and it's absolutely embarrassing because I'm an adult. What will he think of me that my mom keeps an eye on me like I'm still a little girl who doesn't know better?

Once when I was getting ready to go out, she came in the room, closed the door, and was like, ""Remember to use protection,"" meaning if we do something, like, i don't know what to do, duh, I'm 27. And she is asking all those questions like ""Who are his parents? "" and ""What do they do for a living? "" Like, God, it doesn't mean that we will be getting married tomorrow.

I love my mom, and I know she doesn't have ill intent and just wants me to be safe, but I'm an adult, and she has to let me live my own life and have my own experiences. I really don't know what to do; all of this is driving me crazy.

"Background: My mom cheated on my dad over the summer. I am currently unemployed but am in the stages of interviewing for multiple jobs. I help with my brother for the 5 weekdays by staying downstairs with him and helping get him home from school. My dad works a job that requires him to go to the office Mon-Sat. I also have been with my girlfriend for 3 years and tend to spend weekends at her house.

My parents' marriage counselor recommended that I should stay home weekends to babysit my brother so that they can go out on dates to ""rekindle their marriage"" in exchange for not making me pay for things like my phone bill and insurance while I'm unemployed.

I even overheard her tell them to ""not let \[me\] get away with murder.""

This feels completely insane to me and raised red flags in my girlfriend's head as well. I would like advice on what to say to them and what to do.

\*\*Editing to add: I should add that my mom is a stay-at-home mom and I watch my brother Monday through Friday when he gets home from school (around 2:45) to just before bedtime (which is around when my dad gets home). I give him snacks, bathe him, help him in the bathroom, cook him dinner when asked, give him his medications, basically every function he needs, while my mom goes upstairs to watch TV. There have been many times on weekends while I am away that she claims she can't handle him when she hasn't been watching him for that long. He also does not get aggressive towards anyone - it is more self-injurious behavior when he gets upset (while he rarely gets).","arka plan annem yaz boyunca babamı aldattı şu anda işsizim ama birden fazla iş için görüşme aşamasındayım hafta içi kardeşimle birlikte aşağıda kalarak ve onu okuldan eve getirerek ona yardım ediyorum babam ofise gitmesini gerektiren bir işte çalışıyor ayrıca kız arkadaşımla yıllardır birlikteyim ve hafta sonlarını onun evinde geçirmeye meyilliyim

"First off she already messed with our plumbing by flushing lots of wet wipes instead of putting them in the trash. It doesn't help that our house was made in the 60s and is older. She eats a lot of food at once, 6ft and 350lb, and it's affecting not just her but all of us. 

For probably a year or two, she's clogged the toilet EVERY DAY. When the toilet is empty, clean and she hasn't used it yet, it flushes fine. Everytime I go after she's used it the toilet water is completely brown and you can see huge poop and wads of toilet paper floating because it wont flush. I'm pretty sure only diarrhea could make the water THAT brown and it's fucking disgusting. My little brother refuses to use the bathroom until somebody plunges it because he also finds it disgusting. My mom tried to be polite about it but my sister's hasn't gotten the hint or doesn't care.

I'm tired of my mom and I plunging the toilet EVERY DAY it's SICK smells so bad. But she goes through a frozen bag of fries or chicken or pasta in a couple days and her diet is fucking all of us over in many ways. You would think having diarrhea every damn day would be a wake up call but no. Seriously I'm so sick of it. It's embarrassing having my friends over and they make jokes about my old house having a broken toilet and they ""cant use it because its always clogged"". And I'm scared when we eventually get another house that we're still going to have this issue. Mom is scared to hurt her feelings but I don't want to live like this.

"I'm 17F, and I have a sister who is 14. I went out to buy cleaning supplies and I was just approaching the end of my road when I saw a figure that looked a lot like my little sister standing at the end of the road. This was around the time she'd be getting home from school. I was far enough to kind of recognise her and think ""Is that my sister?"" but not close enough to be 100% sure. She was wearing her school colours (a red top and black shorts) so that was an indicator that it could be her, and her hair colour and hair length was the same as my sister's, as was her height. It looked like she was waiting for someone. Then I saw her get into a car, and as it was driving past I just saw a man I've never seen before and her (possibly), and I'm pretty sure there was no one else in the car. I could only see into the car for about half a second, so still not 100% sure if it was her.

About an hour later, when I got home, my sister was there, and I noticed that she was wearing exactly what I saw the girl who was maybe her was wearing. I asked her what she'd been up to, and she said she went to a local park with her friends after school. This seems strange to me, as the park is on the way home and a walking distance from her school, so why would she come near my house and then get in a car (if that was indeed her)?

I'm just a bit unsure on what to do, because I'm not even completely sure it was her even though it seems like it, and I don't want to make people worry for no reason. I also have no evidence. I don't have the kind of relationship with my sister where she'll talk to me if anything dangerous is going on (it's not bad, but we're not particularly close either), so I don't think asking her directly will do much. I'm not sure if I'm just being paranoid and crazy. Should I wait to see if this happens again and collect evidence? Should I talk to someone about it? I'd appreciate any advice.","ben f ve bir kız kardeşim var temizlik malzemeleri almak için dışarı çıktım ve yolumun sonuna yaklaşıyordum yolun sonunda duran küçük kız kardeşime çok benzeyen birini gördüm bu okuldan eve döndüğü zamandı onu tanıyacak kadar uzaktaydım ve kız kardeşim olduğunu düşündüm ama emin olmak için yeterince yakın değildim okul renklerini giyiyordu kırmızı bir üst ve siyah şort bu yüzden onun olabileceğinin bir göstergesiydi ve saç rengi ve saç uzunluğu kız kardeşiminkiyle aynıydı boyu da öyleydi sanki birini bekliyormuş gibi görünüyordu sonra bir arabaya bindiğini gördüm ve araba geçerken daha önce hiç görmediğim bir adam gördüm ve o muhtemelen ve arabada başka kimse olmadığından oldukça eminim sadece yarım saniye kadar arabayı görebildim bu yüzden hala o olup olmadığından emin değilim

"I need advice, I’m struggling to find clothing/ways of dressing that I won’t be sexualized in. 
A lot of girls my age wear leggings and crop tops, but I’ve found that attracts a lot of unwanted attention &amp; comments. I tried dressing in goth, Emo/scene, and those things hoping that people would just think I was weird instead. But that also turned into being sexualized. When I was raped I was wearing a hoodie &amp; sweatpants, so it seems like wearing that doesn’t stop unwanted attention. So then I found a style that was childlike, but even wearing what seems like little girls clothing was seen as sexual. 

Is there anything I can wear? What clothing is not sexualized? Advice would be very helpful, thank you!","tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var, cinselleştirilmeyeceğim giyim tarzları bulmakta zorlanıyorum

"I should start this off by saying that this is the same girl that I found vaping in a previous post. My friend group are all 14M and shes 14f. I should also note that she wasn't fully nude, but she was in her bra. Here's how the story goes. I've been sick for a week with a high fever. Yesterday was no different. So I'm just scrolling through reddit, when I get a snap on snapchat (important later). Usually when i get snaps I think nothing of them. On snapchat there's these things called snapstreaks, where you both send each other a photo every day (again important later). Usually it's like a wall or the floor or a hand, but sometimes it's a face or something else. So I continue reading stories, but about 15 mins later I get a message from one of my best friends who was also somewhat close to her up until we found out she was doing substances.He was like ""bro did you see the last snap she sent you???"" I said no. He told me to check it and I did. She was lying on her bed in a lingerie type bra. And she took a photo of it. I was shocked so I hopped on a call with my friend, and he started it off by saying ""I'm not complaining butttttt......"" this guys horniness is on another level but that's for a different time. He asked around and apparently every guy in my friend group got the same image. But no one could replay it because of snapchat. We all saw the same photo but are all confused. We didn't confront her, but why would a girl do something like that. She hasn't talked to us in nearly 2 months. What is wrong with this girl. Who sends nudes to a bunch of guys that she hasn't seen in a long time. HELP!!!!!!

P.S. to everyone reading from the previous post, ty for the advice it really helped.

EDIT: It’s been less than 8 hours and this post kinda blew up. Going to remove a few personal details because don’t want this stuff to get around that much. Also wtf is wrong with people I keep getting DMs from people asking for her snap help.

Didn’t mean for this to blow up.","Bunu, bir önceki gönderide elektronik sigara kullanırken bulduğum kızla aynı kız olduğunu söyleyerek başlamalıyım. Arkadaş grubumun hepsi erkek ve kız. Ayrıca tamamen çıplak olmadığını ve sütyeniyle olduğunu da belirtmeliyim. Hikaye şöyle: Bir haftadır hastaydım ve dün yüksek ateş vardı. Dün de aynıydı. Bu yüzden sadece reddit'te gezinirken snapchat'te bir snap aldığımda önemli olan daha sonra. Genellikle snap aldığımda snapchat'te onları hiç düşünmem. Snapstreak denen bir şey var. Her gün birbirinize fotoğraf gönderiyorsunuz. Yine önemli olan daha sonra. Genellikle bir duvar, zemin veya el gibi bir şey ama bazen bir yüz veya başka bir şey oluyor. Bu yüzden hikayeleri okumaya devam ediyorum. Ancak birkaç dakika sonra en yakın arkadaşlarımdan birinden bir mesaj alıyorum. Kendisi de ona oldukça yakındı. Madde kullandığını öğrenene kadar. ""Dostum, sana gönderdiği son snap'i gördün mü?"" dedi. ""Hayır"" dedim. Bana kontrol etmemi söyledi ve kontrol ettim. Yatakta iç çamaşırı tipi bir sutyenle yatıyordu ve fotoğrafını çekti. Şok olmuştum. Bu yüzden arkadaşımla bir telefon görüşmesi yaptım ve şöyle başladı: şikayet etmiyorum ama bu adamın azgınlığı başka bir seviyede ama bu başka bir zaman için etrafta dolaştı ve görünüşe göre arkadaş grubumdaki her erkek aynı resmi almış ama snapchat yüzünden kimse tekrar oynatamamış hepimiz aynı fotoğrafı gördük ama hepimiz şaşkınız onunla yüzleşmedik ama bir kız neden böyle bir şey yapsın ki neredeyse aylardır bizimle konuşmuyor uzun zamandır görmediği bir sürü erkeğe çıplak fotoğraf gönderen bu kızda ne sorun var yardım edin

"She’s 76 years old and has been an employee for about 3 years, and only started working as a means to pass the time since her husband passed away. She told managers at the time that 30 hours per week would be plenty. However, she’s a super sweet and nice person with a work ethic and never complains. Over the years the managers have started to take advantage of this. Now she’s exhausted all the time and I worry for her health. She works everyday and even on her scheduled days off they tell her to come in acting like it’s not a choice. She’s not the type of person to put her foot down and say no for fear of disappointing them or possibly getting fired as they often intimidate. Given her age and the current state of the job market, I can understand why she doesn’t think she can get a job anywhere else. I think this is completely unacceptable and unethical for any employer to overwork a 76 year old like this. Every part of me wants to go over there and tell them off as they should be ashamed of themselves. However, I don’t want to be the reason she loses her job because she does need the money and has pleaded me not to do that or even talk with them. Is there any good way to go about this?","yaşında ve yaklaşık yıllardır çalışan ve kocası öldüğünden beri zaman geçirmek için çalışmaya başladı.

"  Today I was watching my toddler while my husband slept with our baby. We live in a trailer in a trailer park that honestly we were lucky to get because of a lot of people moving here for work. I took a bite of a bread knot just as my toddler backed up and tripped over his toy. I as I picked him up to comfort him I managed to get that bite lodged in my throat and started choking. For a long time I first was yelling for my husband, then I could not get enough air for words so I was just making a noise as loud as I could between coughing and gagging. Finally I couldn’t even make noise and I was just coughing and gagging. 
  Just as my husband casually walks out of the bedroom all tired looking I managed to throw up and was able to breathe. He came into the living room to me gasping for air on the floor with white foam all over my chin. He just walked over and said “what happened? I was sleeping.” He didn’t look concerned at all just stood there staring at me. I told him I was choking and almost died. 
  While I was gasping for air he said something about “fucking drug addicts”. (To clarify, before I was married I used to do blow when I would drink. My husband is Indian and he wouldn’t allow that so I stopped 5 years ago). And while I was laying there breathing I thought, what was that?
  He went back to bed shortly after and when he came back out he said in a very unbothered tone “so why were you choking?”. I started to feel very uncomfortable because of the way he had said it. My husband is a very light sleeper and can’t sleep through very much noise. This trailer is also not huge or sound proof at all he was half a trailer length away with absolutely no sound other than what felt like 2 minutes of me choking. I almost died and he didn’t seem to care at all. I obviously did not die, but had I not puked that up I could have.
  Am I crazy for thinking he heard me, or should I be taking my kids and running?

"I am currently sitting at a local coffee shop and I see this cute guy studying at a nearby table. And I don't know how to strike up a conversation. i have had this issue in the past too. Where I see someone I find cute, and end up not saying a word to them. Just sitting or standing nearby, just trying to work up the courage just to go say hi. I have no idea how to to talk to them. Even though I really want to. But wow, just even thinking about it right now is making my hands shake and my nerves and mind feel all over the place. I have no problem talking to other people, I can start a conversation with someone else if I am not attracted to them. I guess it just takes the nerves off. But right now I'm at a lost of what I could even say, or If I could even calm my nerves to even just say hi. Any advice?

But I had been busy, and when I came back, the comments just kept coming one after another. And in case anyone was wondering, No I didn't get the chance to say hi. I had to rush to be some where else and ultimately chickened out. But I really am greatfull that this many people gave me advice. I have read a lot the comments and I found a lot helpful, some funny, some blunt, and others..a bit different to say the least. Overall thank you so much everyone for replying!

"My girlfriend recently had gotten laid off her job. Nobody has hired her since. Before she had gotten laid off, she had around $1k saved up, and was attempting to find some source of income. Asked me if she could sell content on Twitter while I was working, I told her sure. One of the first guys she texted sent her a check for $900 which, obviously, her bank denied. She told me this and I warned her “be careful of scams.” This dude on twitter then told her to get $900 on cashapp she’d have to send him $50 for fees and whatnot. She did. Still no money. Then he asked for $50 more. She sent it. Still no money given to her, yet this guy asked for $100, then $200, then $300 twice, totaling $1,000. She never got anything back. I understand that sometimes scams happen, but I can’t believe she kept sending HIM money despite him supposed to be buying content from her. I really can’t tell, should I be mad or upset at her? Should I forgive her? Mistakes happen but I warned her to be careful, and she should’ve known better. She currently has a bank dispute filed but I don’t think they’ll be able to do much. What do I do in this situation? Do I help her out? It was her money that she lost but it hurts us both with her being unemployed. I’ve been paying rent, bills, working 6 days a week, etc. while she sits at home losing a grand in less than a few hours. I love her but I’m lost in this situation.

One day my car wouldn’t start and i told him id have to miss our session because of it. He found my address from my membership details and sent me it over a text confirming thats where I lived so he could come pick me up for our session. I declined and started distancing myself. I ghosted him for a while and found a new gym. I finally gained the courage to go into that gym again after months of not going and the next morning he texted me repeatedly and went into my account to schedule sessions with him. As if he was just stalking my account waiting for me to show up to the gym, or maybe it was a coincidence he texted me the morning after i went in. I was angry and in the moment i reported him, he got fired that day. He then turned around and texted me repeatedly about how I got him fired. He’s a total creep but why do i feel so guilty, I didn’t intend for him to get fired i just wanted the gum to block him from seeing my personal information and texting me.

"I'm starting to get really worried. I've been stuck in a sex less marriage for over 10 years and I finally separated. I'm currently sleeping in the guest room and basically living in there. I can't leave yet because, for many reasons I was mostly a housewife during the marriage and I just started my own business which will need a bit more time to get me to the point of complete independence. I'm alone in the country, except for my younger son who's working and is very supportive. So... why am I scared. 
Because since I moved out from the bedroom my husband has been treating me horrible. He was way nicer to me that to others, he has no friends except online friends and is extremely critical of everyone and mostly of my son, he hates him and that's the main reason why we couldn't get along, intimacy is just another layer of the multiple issues we've been having during all this years. 
My older son is in my home country Ecuador. He  recently called me and my husband answered the phone while I was doing the laundry, my son asked for me and he told my son ""I killed her and she's buried in the backyard"" Why would someone say something like that to a person who lives so far away and that happens to be My Son!!. I haven't been able to go back to see my family after COVID, I can't afford the trip right now and nobody can come to visit.
It was supposed to be a joke but I'm in a very vulnerable position here and I watch a lot of true crime stories. My younger son has opened up more to me and is being telling me about things he said in the past that he didn't want to tell me before because he didn't wanted to create more conflict. 
There's so much more I could say to give more context but I thought this was the most relevant. I needed to vent and also, I want to know if I'm making a big deal out of something silly.","Gerçekten endişelenmeye başlıyorum, yıllardır sekssiz bir evlilikte sıkışıp kaldım ve sonunda ayrıldım, şu anda misafir odasında uyuyorum ve temelde orada yaşıyorum, henüz ayrılamıyorum çünkü birçok nedenden dolayı evliliğim sırasında çoğunlukla ev hanımıydım ve kendi işimi kurdum, bu da beni tam bağımsızlığa kavuşturmak için biraz daha zamana ihtiyaç duyacak, ülkede yalnızım, çalışan ve çok destekleyici olan küçük oğlum dışında, peki neden korkuyorum

so im getting married next July and as we get things ready the topic of a guest list came up. our wedding will be around 200 people, so when making the list i intentionally avoided adding in a family member who used to molest me when i was a kid. no one ever knew of the abuse but its something that affects me to this day, i cant even stand looking at this person without feeling horrible. anyways, my mother went over the list and immediately noticed they werent on there and has since been asking why i wont invite them, and saying that it will be rude of me not to specifically leave them out. i know i cant be mad at her since she obviously doesnt know about the abuse but i refuse to have this person there on my special day, and my partner also does not want them there. what can i do here? i dont want to tell her what happened, i know it would break her heart, but at the same time she will feel hurt if i dont invite this person who she is close with. how can i explain this to her? any advice is welcome!","tw sa

yani önümüzdeki temmuzda evleniyorum ve hazırlıklarımızı yaparken davetli listesi konusu gündeme geldi, düğünümüz insanlarla ilgili olacak, bu yüzden listeyi yaparken çocukken bana tacizde bulunan bir aile üyesini eklemekten kasıtlı olarak kaçındım, kimse tacizden haberdar değildi ama bu beni bugün bile etkileyen bir şey, bu kişiye bakmaya dayanamıyorum, her neyse, annem listeye baktı ve hemen orada olmadıklarını fark etti ve o zamandan beri neden onları davet etmediğimi soruyor ve onları özellikle dışarıda bırakmamamın kabalık olacağını söylüyor, ona kızamayacağımı biliyorum çünkü tacizden haberi yok ama bu kişinin özel günümde orada olmasını reddediyorum ve partnerim de onları orada istemiyor, burada ne yapabilirim, ona ne olduğunu söylemek istemiyorum, kalbini kıracağını biliyorum ama aynı zamanda yakın olduğu bu kişiyi davet etmezsem incinmiş hissedecek, bunu ona nasıl açıklayabilirim, her türlü tavsiye memnuniyetle karşılanır"
"I 19m have been seeing a guy 23m for around 2 weeks now. we met through a hookup app but ended up having a pretty great conversation followed by meeting up a few more times before making it official. now we both live very close by in a country that is one of the most racist countries in the world. he's a citizen of said country but I however am an immigrat who was born in this country. so when he asked my ethnicity and nationality, I ended up lying to him about both because I really didn't expect to see him again, but now that we're officially dating I don't know how to tell him that I lied. it seems so trivial but people of my ethnicity are very often discriminated against here. while I personally don't think he's the type of guy who would be racist, I can't help but feel like he'll view me as a liar, which I'm not in a position to deny but I do find honesty to be a very important value especially in a relationship. I feel awful about the fact that I lied but I really don't know how to come clean. any advice?


UPDATE: 
I asked him to meet up with me for half an hour or so and in person, i finally confessed everything. He immediately assured me that it didn't matter to him and how he likes me because of who I am and not because of my passport or country of origin😭. However we did have a talk about honesty and I assured him that the only lie I told was revolving my ethnicity and nationality but it was honestly such a relief to hear him be ok with it. He seemed upset for a while though, saying he's definitely not that kind of person and how it was unnecessary for me to lie but after I explained myself and the position I was in he took it pretty well
thank you to everyone who replied and supported my decision to be completely honest with him, I seriously appreciate you guys and I don't think i would've done it so soon without the feedback I received. 
(side note: even though I asked to meet for half an hour, we stayed there for more than 2 hours and had an amazing time)","yaklaşık haftadır bir adamla görüşüyorum, bir tanışma uygulaması aracılığıyla tanıştık ama sonunda oldukça iyi bir sohbet ettik ve resmi hale getirmeden önce birkaç kez daha buluştuk, şimdi ikimiz de dünyanın en ırkçı ülkelerinden birinde, çok yakınlarda yaşıyoruz, o söz konusu ülkenin vatandaşı ama ben bu ülkede doğmuş bir göçmenim, bu yüzden etnik kökenimi ve milliyetimi sorduğunda, onu tekrar görmeyi gerçekten beklemediğim için her ikisi hakkında da ona yalan söyledim ama şimdi resmi olarak çıkıyoruz, ona yalan söylediğimi nasıl söyleyeceğimi bilmiyorum, çok önemsiz görünüyor ama benim etnik kökenimdeki insanlar burada çok sık ayrımcılığa uğruyor, şahsen onun ırkçı olabilecek bir adam olduğunu düşünmüyorum, cehennemin beni yalancı olarak görmesinden kendimi alamıyorum, bunu inkar edecek durumda değilim ama dürüstlüğün özellikle bir ilişkide çok önemli bir değer olduğunu düşünüyorum, yalan söylediğim gerçeğinden dolayı kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum ama gerçekten nasıl temizleneceğimi bilmiyorum, herhangi bir tavsiye

ondan benimle buluşmasını istedim yarım saat kadar ve şahsen sonunda her şeyi itiraf ettim, hemen bana bunun kendisi için önemli olmadığını ve beni pasaportum veya geldiğim ülke yüzünden değil, olduğum kişi yüzünden sevdiğini söyledi, ancak dürüstlük hakkında konuştuk ve ona söylediğim tek yalanın etnik kökenim ve milliyetimle ilgili olduğunu söyledim, ancak dürüst olmak gerekirse onun bununla ilgili bir sorunu olmadığını duymak beni rahatlattı, ancak bir süre üzgün göründü, kesinlikle öyle biri olmadığını ve yalan söylememin gereksiz olduğunu söyledi, ancak kendimi ve içinde bulunduğum durumu açıkladıktan sonra bunu oldukça iyi karşıladı

"Please be kind, really going through it right now😭

For context, my boyfriend ‘24 M’ and I ‘24 F’ have been together for 7 years, and we have 2 beautiful little girls. 

The other day I was on his photos on his phone, and seen that there was recently deleted photos, I go into it and there’s screenshots from my sister’s (27) Facebook profile, mainly bikini photos, 4 of them, and then 2 photos of an AI generated image of my sister NAKED. 

Unfortunately, growing up, even though me and my sister were only a stone and a half in weight difference, me being 8 1/2 - 9 stone, people have made comments about my size compared to her, some boys growing up have said some awful things to me. This has always affected me, from the age of around 8/9, even our grampy commenting on me being chubby ect. I’ve struggled with body dysmorphia ever since. Not my sisters fault in the slightest, I love my sister, we’re very close. 

Now, straight away I confronted him, I got mad and I left the house for a little bit to calm down and have a cry, upon coming back, he’s been apologetic, he’s admitted it all and said he shouldn’t have done it and that it’s disgusting. And also randomly bringing up a “porn addiction”. In my opinion, even if you had a porn addiction, that wouldn’t be an excuse to do something like that. This happened less than 2 days ago, I keep going through the emotions of anger, confusion, extremely upset, and this just keeps going from one to the other. 

I’m really really struggling, he’s always known the issues surrounding myself and where it all originated from, yet he still did that?? I have a large family, but I feel I can’t come to them with any of this because we have kids together, everyone would find out and it just makes it into an even bigger thing, and I guess I’m still protecting him in that way. I also don’t have any friends I can trust to share this information with and that they wouldn’t pass it on. 

What would you do in this situation?

ne yazık ki büyürken kız kardeşimle aramızda sadece bir buçuk kilo fark olmasına rağmen ben taş olduğum için insanlar onunla kıyaslandığında benim boyum hakkında yorumlar yaptı bazı oğlanlar büyürken bana korkunç şeyler söyledi bu beni her zaman etkiledi yaklaşık yaşımdan beri hatta büyükbabam bile tombul olduğum hakkında yorum yaptı vb. o zamandan beri vücut dismorfisi ile mücadele ettim en ufak bir şekilde kız kardeşimin hatası değil kız kardeşimi çok seviyorum çok yakındık

şimdi hemen onunla yüzleştim sinirlendim ve sakinleşmek ve ağlamak için evden biraz ayrıldım geri döndüğümde özür diledi her şeyi itiraf etti ve bunu yapmaması gerektiğini ve iğrenç olduğunu söyledi ve ayrıca rastgele bir porno bağımlılığından bahsetmek bence porno bağımlılığınız olsa bile böyle bir şey yapmak için bir bahane olmazdı bu birkaç gün önce oldu öfke, kafa karışıklığı, aşırı üzüntü duygularıyla boğuşuyorum ve bu birinden diğerine geçip duruyor

gerçekten çok zorlanıyorum o her zaman etrafımdaki sorunları ve bunların nereden kaynaklandığını biliyordu ama yine de bunu yaptı kalabalık bir ailem var ama çocuklarımız olduğu için onlarla bunların hiçbirini konuşamayacağımı hissediyorum herkes öğrenirdi ve bu daha da büyük bir soruna dönüşür ve sanırım onu ​​hala bu şekilde koruyorum ayrıca bu bilgiyi paylaşabileceğim ve bana iletmeyecekleri konusunda güvenebileceğim hiçbir arkadaşım yok

"TW! ⚠️ S*xual Abuse

I issued a trigger warning, and this is difficult for me to even tell, but I have no one to ask for their opinion on this sort of thing, and I’m genuinely stuck.

My (25F) estranged biological father is a p*dophile and abused me as a child until my mother found out and got full custody of me. Because of this, I have never known any of my family on that side. My mother is adopted, so I have no family health history info from either side, and really need to know as I am looking into my own health issues. My first cousin (24F) has gone to school with me our whole lives and we travelled in similar circles but have never spoken. I finally got the gall to reach out to her to meet with me to speak about family history, etc. partially for health concern reasons, and partially because I’m curious to know her. She seems genuinely cool, and we are first cousins. I know she is going to ask all of the ‘why’ questions, and I’m unsure how to answer. I don’t feel that it is my duty to protect the scumbag that abused me, but I also feel like it would be wrong to destroy this woman’s perception of her family. Should I tell her the truth, or should I lie to protect her reality? Sorry if this was upsetting to read for some folks, I’ve been through years of therapy just to be able to speak about it.

Editing to say: My cousin and the family MIGHT already know and may well have already ostracized him. Like I said, this will be my first time speaking with anyone from that entire side of the family in 20 years (I’m only 25) so I have no idea what to expect.

ETA: UPDATE!! - I met with her, told her the truth and she took it really well. I didn’t go into gory details, because she understood without them. Come to find out, she did some prodding of her own Dad afterward and my bio father was divorced from his wife before I was ever born bc he was abusing her kid, but his family didn’t know in what way. According to [cousin], my sperm donor has always been the person that the family avoids and doesn’t like anyway. So next I get to meet my aunts and uncles, and grandparents. I’ve been welcomed into the family. I think this actually ended well. Thank you to everyone for the good advice.","tw cinsel taciz

"Hi there! Long time lurker. Thanks in advance for your time ◡̈ 

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 7 months. Things are pretty good for us and we are super close. We already live together and have a beautiful home. But there has been one consistent issue throughout almost the entirety of our relationship. Sleep. She hates sleep and because of childhood trauma revolving around sleep in her past she can’t stand when the man in her life sleeps. 

I work nights and have a revolving schedule with 12 hour shifts. I make good money and I am the main source of income for our household lately. Sleep is super important to me and my journey in health but also just super important to be well rested for work. 

Almost daily she wakes me up after about 4 hours of me sleeping. The reasoning ranges from “she’s just bored” “she’s in the MOOD” “she’s stressed and needs to talk” or anything revolving around the house/us. Last night I was off of work and joined her in sleep. I fell asleep around midnight. She fell asleep around 9 pm. She wakes me up at 2:15 asking “is it crazy that I want to clean the house right now?”. I was upset and gave her a non answer and went back to sleep. She woke me up again at 3:30 and again at 5:45. I didn’t go back to sleep after that. I have to nap before work tonight and I know that’s gonna be tough for me. 

So what really really pisses me off about this is she sleeps maybe 3-4 hours a night. Wakes up, has alone time. Clocks into work(she works from home) then proceeds to nap all day while clocked in. She’ll wake up here and there to do some work stuff but her work barely monitors her activity. 

Over the last few months I’ve barely gone to the gym. I’m constantly hungry and I’m always grumpy. She wants me to get a prescription to something like adderall(which she takes often). I just want to get good sleep and take care of myself. 

I don’t want to end the relationship but I simply cannot live this way much longer. How do I convey the seriousness of this to her? I’ve had talks with her before and even threatened to leave her over this. It will be good for a couple days at most then back to the same ole same ole. I’m exhausted. I’m broken down. I need help. Any advice is greatly appreciate. Thank you.

kız arkadaşımla aylardır çıkıyoruz her şey yolunda ve çok yakınız zaten birlikte yaşıyoruz ve güzel bir evimiz var ama ilişkimizin neredeyse tamamı boyunca sürekli bir sorun var uyku o uykudan nefret ediyor ve geçmişinde uykuyla ilgili çocukluk travması yaşadığı için hayatındaki adam uyuduğunda dayanamıyor

geceleri çalışıyorum ve vardiyalı bir programım var iyi para kazanıyorum ve son zamanlarda evimizin ana gelir kaynağıyım uyku benim ve sağlık yolculuğum için çok önemli ama aynı zamanda iş için dinlenmiş olmak da çok önemli

neredeyse her gün saatlerce uyuduktan sonra beni uyandırıyor sebepleri arasında değişiyor sadece sıkılmış ruh halinde stresli ve konuşması gerekiyor ya da evle ilgili bir şey dün gece işten izinliydim ve ona katıldım uyku gece yarısı civarı uyuyakaldım o da akşam civarı uyuyakaldı beni uyandırıp şu anda evi temizlemek istememin çılgınlık olup olmadığını soruyor üzgündüm ve ona cevap vermedim ve tekrar uyudum, beni tekrar tekrar uyandırdı, ondan sonra tekrar uyumadım, bu gece işe gitmeden önce uyumam gerekiyor ve bunun benim için zor olacağını biliyorum

bu konuda beni gerçekten çok sinirlendiren şey, geceleri belki saatlerce uyuması, yalnız kalması, işe gitmesi, evden çalışması ve sonra işe gittiğinde bütün gün uyuması, arada sırada uyanıp bazı işler yapması ama işi onun aktivitesini zar zor takip ediyor

son birkaç aydır spor salonuna zar zor gidiyorum, sürekli açım ve hep huysuzum, sık sık aldığı adderall gibi bir şey için reçete almamı istiyor, sadece iyi uyumak ve kendime bakmak istiyorum

ilişkiyi bitirmek istemiyorum ama bu şekilde daha fazla yaşayamam, bunun ciddiyetini ona nasıl iletebilirim, daha önce onunla konuştum ve hatta onu bu yüzden terk etmekle tehdit ettim, en fazla birkaç gün iyi olacak, sonra aynı eski eskiye geri döneceğim, bitkinim, yıkıldım, yardıma ihtiyacım var, her türlü tavsiye çok takdir edilir, teşekkür ederim"

However, the issue I face is that there are two potential fathers and I don’t know if I should even mention it if I’m not going to be able to carry? I’ve made an appointment already to see what the options for me are and to narrow down the dates with a lot more accuracy so is it worth waiting until then?

"So I had a fling and stupidly exchanged nude and explicit photos and videos of myself, some including my face.  Lesson learned!  We talked about deleting photos of each other after receiving, but there’s no way to know now since he stopped communicating with me.  How worried should I be?  Where do I begin to search?

ETA:
I am NOT married or otherwise committed to anyone.  We met on Reddit after I posted some face photos in the doppelgänger sub.  I had pure intentions of looking for a look a like, I didn’t know what Reddit was all about at this point.  Naive, now stupid me!  He sent me a message and we chatted casually for a time until things progressed.  We chatted for over 4 months off and on.  We knew personal information about each other and took our communication off of Reddit via phone calls and texts.  There was talk of meeting in person because we established what I thought was a genuine connection.  He was pushy for more explicit photos and videos which turned me off and should have turned me away.  Ultimately he said we needed a break because according to him we weren’t on the same page.  I caught feelings.  He says it’s not permanent.  Probably grew tired of me and is fishing for others on here now.  What will be the best response to him when he returns?  

EATA:
Wow, thank you everyone for the advice and some for kindness and reassurance.  I really have learned my lesson, so please stop sending me messages as if I’m going to send you nudes.  I made stupid decisions, but am not completely daft.  Stop trying to prey on the weak.

Final update:
No photos or videos have been found yet.  I will ignore any incoming messages from this man.  I will not make the same mistakes again.  I appreciate all of the words of encouragement and reassurance from so many of you.  If anyone encounters such a man/woman, please be smarter than me and don’t do it!

"So last night, me and my roomies and other friends went to the bars for the one who cheated’s birthday. It was five of us girls in total. We’ll call roomie who cheated Christa. She wanted to get “blacked out” and for us to watch her and we did. Two of the five of us were completely sober. Me and my other roommate(we’ll call Jess) were only buzzed by the end of the night. Christa invited her big group of guy friends to the bars as well and she hangs out with them most of the night. Christa ended up going to the bathroom to throw up what she ate plus alcohol around the beginning of this night. We watched her the whole night and she did not have much to drink. Christa ends up hanging with this guy(we’ll call Sam) who is her coworker, once all of her guy friends leave. She kept running away from us and going with him many times that night. We had to search through a back to back crowd of people and still had a hard time getting to her. She wanted us to stay until midnight and we do, but once it hit we all wanted to leave. We finally got to her and we begged her to come home with us and she said she wanted to stay. Since Christa and Sam are coworkers, we feel like we’re able to leave. We are all extremely skeptical though. As we are walking back to the car, Jess tells us that she’s been keeping this a secret but Christa has made out with other guys at different parties we go to. Our other friend tell us that she caught her and Sam making out on the main floor. Turns out, we all had stories of her infidelity. We start making a plan on how to talk to her. I forgot to mention the boyfriend but he is one hour away from us because we go to college, so they are long distance. He plans on coming down here for college just to be closer to her. Me and Jess get dropped off and we talk about everything and how we feel about the whole situation. Jess leaves to stay at her boyfriends and I am getting ready for bed. Luckily enough Sam brought Christa back home. They go back into her room and they have sex(we live in a dorm so our walls are really thin so everything was heard). This morning, they were chatting and it seemed they knew what happened last night. Her family and boyfriend are coming over today for her birthday. Is there anything I or Jess can do? I’ve never had to deal with this situation before and I’m not sure what the best course of action is. I don’t want to overstep but this is a big problem now. Any help is appreciated.

Update: Hi guys! I’ve gotten a lot of very differentiating advice and I think it ended up solving itself. Me and Jess have been thinking about it all day and talking about our plan. Christa went to Jess and told her that she is not in love with her bf anymore and she and her bf have been staying in her room this whole time. Me and Jess think she is breaking up with her bf tonight. We haven’t said anything up until this point. 

We definitely do not agree with what she did and will address such as friends later since we are genuinely worried about her wellbeing and behavior. 

I think all of the advice I’ve gotten is great, but they are all on completely from both sides of the spectrum. I do think both sides have value since it really is not my place to intrude but as a friend genuinely worried about her behavior, we want to help her stop this bad behavior and do the right thing. This is a difficult situation to truly have the right answer for even if it seems simple. We’re not excusing her behavior in any sense, but we do want to help her with how bad her cheating got when she is drinking. Thank you all for your advice!

"*Update: He had surgery on the thumb today. The surgeon said it is good that we did the surgery because now it has a chance of being fully functional and looking normal. He also confirmed that if I didn’t pull the finger out of the chopper the way I did, and my son moved, he probably would have amputated a part of the finger. 

*Update: Thank you to all those who took the time to comment. Honestly the feedback helped me look at things more rationally. I was in such shock the first few days that I wasn’t thinking clearly. Your comments also helped me realize I have an abnormal amount of balls in the air; I thought this is just how life is. Turns out people don’t juggle as much on a daily basis. It was eye opening. 

On Thanksgiving my 2.5 year old son climbed into his stool at the kitchen counter. He stuck his thumb in the square blade of the vegetable chopper. It was a grid of square blades perfect for a baby’s finger to enter. I realized and without thinking I pulled his thumb out in a panic. It sliced off his nail at the nail bed. (Edit: it sliced off the ACTUAL nail bed, like a part of his finger.)

We immediately rushed to urgent care. There’s no skin to stitch but it is a bad wound. We have to take him to a hand surgeon right away to see how to proceed. His nail might not grow back. 

I can’t handle the guilt. I know where I messed up:
1) I didn’t put the blade away because I was rushing to take my 5 month old up for a nap.
2) After the baby’s nap I didn’t put the blade away because I was rushing to pack up the food and leave for Thanksgiving dinner, so I forgot about it.
3) I was so focussed on packing up food that I wasn’t paying attention to what my toddler was doing and that gave him the opportunity to put his finger in the blade.
4) I should have slowed down, not panicked, and slowly removed his finger. It happened so quickly. (Edit to add: My husband pointed out that it was stuck. My husband grabbed his other hands then I instantly removed it from the blade without thinking.)

Before someone says “just supervise your kid,” I am usually a really good mom. I am always on top of their safety. Every decision I make is based around my kids. My husband and I don’t go on dates (Edit to add: because they wont fall asleep independently so if a babysitter is left to deal with their bedtime or nap time then the kids’ sleep will suffer) or trips because we don’t want to be away from them for that long. I am not usually so absent minded. I am just over tired with a 5  month old that wont sleep on her own, trying to run a business as a solo attorney, breastfeed, take care of three dogs, and maintain a house and marriage. It’s as if my brain ran out of space and stopped functioning in that moment. 

Can someone help me rationalize? My husband kindly says if I didn’t take it out myself, then my son might have caused more damage. Any advice is appreciated.","güncelleme bugün baş parmağından ameliyat oldu cerrah ameliyat olmamızın iyi olduğunu söyledi çünkü artık tamamen işlevsel ve normal görünme şansı var ayrıca parmağımı doğrayıcıdan bu şekilde çekmeseydim ve oğlum hareket etseydi muhtemelen parmağının bir kısmını kesmiş olurdu

I (28m) ran a all-girl youth group and there's no other leader besides for me. All of my girls respect me and listen to me. The youngest girl that I have there is 11 and the oldest girl that I have there is 17. I love all my girls. I was talking to a girl I used to go to college with and she ask me what my job was I told her I ran a all-girl youth group.  She got super weird out and told me how that's inappropriate and how I should have a female there.,ben bir kız gençlik grubu yönetiyorum ve benden başka bir lider yok tüm kızlarım bana saygı duyuyor ve beni dinliyorlar en genç kız orada ve en yaşlı kız orada ben tüm kızlarımı seviyorum üniversiteye gittiğim bir kızla konuşuyordum ve bana ne iş yaptığımı sordu ona bir kız gençlik grubu yönettiğimi söyledim çok garip davrandı ve bunun uygunsuz olduğunu ve orada bir kadının olması gerektiğini söyledi
"I’m starting a new job soon and I’ll be able to comfortably afford to hire a housekeeper. I’ve always been bad about keeping the house clean and I figure why not if I can afford it, but I worry I’ll be seen as lazy. What would y’all do?",yakında yeni bir işe başlayacağım ve bir temizlikçi tutacak kadar param olacak. evi temiz tutma konusunda her zaman kötüydüm ve eğer param yetiyorsa neden olmasın diye düşündüm ama tembel olarak görüleceğimden endişeleniyorum. siz ne yapardınız?
"It’s not possible to me to talk with female friends about it and that’s very  surreal to me. I noticed that my bf displayed a strange kind of aggressiveness towards other men in the last time. And after I followed it up he confessed to me that he got raped by a man. It was a acquaintance from a friend and he got chloroformed. He kind of participated in it because he threatened him. But at least he doesn’t feel ashamed for this part since he had no choice. I am paranoid to write about the scumbag but first I thought that this physically assaulting part could be made up from him to cope with his anger but it’s true… I am afraid that the police could be there every day idk if hes alive because he is apparently in a critical state ( we live in Europe) and I feel sad about the whole situation generally and that he could be punished, his general behavior and we had sex a few times after that and he wanted another woman and was really aggressive to both of us. I am really confused now","Bu konuda kadın arkadaşlarımla konuşmam mümkün değil ve bu benim için çok gerçeküstü. Erkek arkadaşımın son zamanlarda diğer erkeklere karşı garip bir saldırganlık sergilediğini fark ettim ve konuyu takip ettikten sonra bana bir erkek tarafından tecavüze uğradığını itiraf etti, bir arkadaşının tanıdığıydı ve kloroform aldı, bir nevi buna katıldı çünkü onu tehdit etti ama en azından bu kısım için utanmıyor çünkü başka seçeneği yoktu. Bu pislik hakkında yazmak konusunda paranoyak davranıyorum ama ilk önce bu fiziksel saldırı kısmının öfkesiyle başa çıkmak için onun tarafından uydurulmuş olabileceğini düşündüm ama doğru. Polisin her gün orada olabileceğinden korkuyorum. Hayatta olup olmadığını bilmiyorum çünkü görünüşe göre kritik bir durumda, Avrupa'da yaşıyoruz ve genel olarak tüm durum hakkında üzgünüm ve cezalandırılabileceğini düşünüyorum. Genel davranışları ve bundan sonra birkaç kez seks yaptık ve başka bir kadın istedi ve ikimize karşı çok saldırgandı. Şimdi gerçekten kafam karıştı."
"I (23M) met a girl (27F) and asked her out to ice cream or coffee. She proceeds to tell me that she doesn’t do coffee dates. I asked her why and she says “idk, they’re weird and awkward”. Then I ask her what she would like to do instead. To which she replies saying “I guess we can go to one lol”.

Note - I’m a software engineer with a flexible schedule whereas she works 2 jobs as a server and admin assistant and is always busy.

What am I supposed to say to that? I have no idea how to proceed with such statement.

‼️UPDATE‼️:

What a massive discussion this has turned into; thank you everyone for sharing your thoughts and ideas!

I decided to ask her to teach me to bake something since she likes baking to which she replied saying she isn’t the best but she can try. On top of that, she asked if I wanted to FaceTime her and sent me her number. I ended up FaceTiming her and a few minutes later, we had a spontaneous house date where I came over to her place where we hung out, drove to get food together before closing time, and she baked me cookies. We spent till past midnight and really hit off. We even held hands already.

I went back home for thanksgiving with my family and we have been FaceTiming every night. It’s clear she’s pretty into me which was a shocker after the dry and weird texts she would exchange with me. She told me she was purposely dry cause she’s not really an texter and likes to troll on dating apps sometimes since she’s become jaded from the lack of quality guys. Overall so far, things have been progressing well and she seems like a good person. Crazy how quickly things changed around here.","bir kızla tanıştım ve onu dondurma veya kahve içmeye davet ettim, bana kahve buluşmaları yapmadığını söyledi, nedenini sordum ve bana bunun garip ve tuhaf olduğunu söyledi, sonra ona bunun yerine ne yapmak istediğini sordum, o da sanırım birine gidebiliriz dedi lol

bu ne kadar büyük bir tartışmaya dönüştü, düşüncelerinizi ve fikirlerinizi paylaştığınız için hepinize teşekkür ederim

bana bir şeyler pişirmeyi öğretmesini istemeye karar verdim, çünkü pişirmeyi seviyor, o da en iyisi olmadığını ama deneyebileceğini söyledi, bunun üstüne bana görüntülü görüşmek isteyip istemediğimi sordu ve bana numarasını gönderdi, sonunda görüntülü görüştük ve birkaç dakika sonra onun evine gittiğimiz, takıldığımız, kapanış saatinden önce birlikte yemek yemek için yola çıktığımız ve bana kurabiye yaptığı, gece yarısına kadar birlikte vakit geçirdiğimiz ve gerçekten çok iyi anlaştığımız, hatta el ele tutuştuğumuz bir buluşmamız oldu zaten

Ailemle Şükran Günü için eve döndüm ve her gece görüntülü konuşuyoruz, bana karşı oldukça ilgili olduğu açık, bu benimle yaptığı kuru ve tuhaf mesajlardan sonra şok ediciydi, bana bilerek kuru olduğunu söyledi çünkü gerçekten mesaj atan biri değil ve bazen kaliteli erkeklerin eksikliğinden bıkmış olduğundan flört uygulamalarında trolleme yapmayı seviyor, şimdiye kadar her şey yolunda gidiyor ve iyi bir insan gibi görünüyor, çılgınca, buradaki her şey ne kadar çabuk değişti"
"Not going to give out too many details, but my partner (31F) told me (24M) through text, ""you can literally take your daughter and go. I don't even want to be around you."" The context of the fight was me not asking permission to use her car. We live together, and I help pay for the car. I have my own truck that's paid off, but the car seat was in the car. I took our daughter to work with me in the morning, so she could sleep in. She texted me minutes after I left the house, verbally berating me for taking the car. I came home from the meeting, understandably in a bad mood, after being told to ""Shut the f*** up."" We got into an argument, in which she packed her things and left. Hours later she sends me the message in the picture.

Does this count as child abandonment or anything of the likes? Would I legally be allowed to take our daughter and go, just like the asked? My daughter and I would be moving 5 1/2 hours back home. There is currently child support in play (long story, I pay) but no custody order between us. ","çok fazla ayrıntı vermeyeceğim ama partnerim bana mesaj atarak kızını alıp gidebileceğini söyledi senin etrafında bile olmak istemiyorum kavganın bağlamı arabasını kullanmak için izin istemememdi birlikte yaşıyoruz ve arabanın parasını ödemeye yardım ediyorum kendi kamyonetim var ve ödendi ama araba koltuğu arabadaydı kızımızı sabah işe götürdüm böylece uyuyabilirdi evden çıktıktan birkaç dakika sonra bana mesaj attı arabayı aldığım için sözlü olarak azarladı toplantıdan eve geldim anlaşılabilir bir şekilde çenemi kapatmam söylendikten sonra kötü bir ruh hali içindeydim bir tartışmaya girdik eşyalarını toplayıp saatler sonra gitti bana resimdeki mesajı gönderdi

"I've been on Reddit for a few days trying to get the nerve up to post this.

My daughter who's 24 is marrying ""Connor"" 29 in a bit over a month. I've only ever wanted my children to be happy, regardless of what they do in life or who they date/love. Maybe if Conner were convicted of breaking and entering or drink driving then I could let it slide as he makes my baby happy. But this I can not forgive. 

I knew Connor had spent some time in jail but I didn't know what for until MY SON told me. And no I didn't believe him straight away, I looked into it personally and then asked my daughter. 

It hurts my heart so much but she says he was ""a stupid 20 something year old"" and it ""wasn't like that"" and that ""(the child) was old enough to know better"" (I won't give specifics) 

Please, I need to get my girl away from this man, can someone please give me advice on how to talk some sense into her. This isn't safe for her. What about any children they have? I can't let that happen. Please Reddit I'm begging you for advice

Edit: I see a few people assuming that the reason he went to prison is something minor (someone said pissing in a park; which I would not care about) I won't elaborate much, but Conner went to prison at 21 for 3 years and is now on the sex offender's registration for sexual acts against an under 16 year old. It was not in any way minor or forgivable. The fact he is out of prison at all is shocking. ","Birkaç gündür reddit'teyim ve bunu yayınlamak için cesaret toplamaya çalışıyorum

Bir aydan biraz fazla bir süre sonra connor ile evlenecek kızım, çocuklarımın hayatta ne yaptıklarına veya kiminle çıktıklarına bakmaksızın mutlu olmalarını istedim, belki connor izinsiz girme veya içkili araç kullanma suçundan hüküm giyerse, bebeğimi mutlu ettiği için bunu görmezden gelebilirim ama bunu affedemem

Connor'ın bir süre hapis yattığını biliyordum ama oğlum bana söyleyene kadar ne için olduğunu bilmiyordum ve hayır, ona hemen inanmadım, bizzat araştırdım ve sonra kızıma sordum

Yüreğim çok acıyor ama o aptal bir şey yaşında olduğunu ve öyle olmadığını ve çocuğun daha iyisini bilmek için yeterince büyük olduğunu söylüyor, ayrıntı vermeyeceğim

Lütfen kızımı bu adamdan uzaklaştırmam gerekiyor, lütfen biri bana kızımı nasıl ikna edebileceğim konusunda tavsiyede bulunabilir mi, bu onun için güvenli değil, ya çocukları varsa, bunun olmasına izin veremem lütfen reddit sizden tavsiye istiyorum

Düzenleme Birkaç kişinin bunu varsaydığını görüyorum hapse girmesinin sebebi önemsiz bir şeydi, birisi parkta işediğini söyledi, bunu çok fazla açıklamayacağım ama conner yıllarca hapis yattı ve şimdi bir yaş altı çocuğa karşı cinsel eylemlerde bulunduğu için cinsel suçlular sicilinde kayıtlı, bu hiçbir şekilde önemsiz veya affedilebilir bir şey değildi, hapisten çıkmış olması bile şok edici"
I took a test the other day because my boyfriend didn’t want to wear protection and I missed my period for a few weeks. I just feel so stupid and stressed. I don’t want to tell my mom either because she’ll ground me for life. I always heard about that one pregnant girl at school and the fact i’m that girl now just really scares me. I go to a really uptight Christian school and they will kick me out if I get an abortion. It’s a small school so someone will find out eventually. My boyfriend doesn’t even know.,"geçen gün erkek arkadaşım korunmak istemediği ve birkaç hafta adet görmediğim için bir test yaptım, kendimi çok aptal ve stresli hissediyorum, anneme de söylemek istemiyorum çünkü Shell beni hayatım boyunca cezalandırdı, okulda hamile bir kız olduğunu hep duydum ve şu an o kız olmam beni gerçekten korkutuyor, çok katı bir Hristiyan okuluna gidiyorum ve kürtaj yaptırırsam beni oradan atıyorlar, küçük bir okul, bu yüzden sonunda birileri öğrenecek, erkek arkadaşım bile bilmiyor"
"I am (f16), my friend is (m16), and his cousin is (m17). The three of us are from the same school and we were both part of the same group for a project, so I had my friend fetch me from my home and ask my mom for permission coz if I were the one to ask my mom, she wouldn't believe me that it's just for a school project. When he came to get me, he was already w his cousin. 

When we were on our way to the meeting place of our group project, we got a msg from our gc that the meeting time got moved to later in the day and we've already been walking for a while atp so we're far from my home. They decided to jus go back to my friend's home and I tagged along w them bcs they mentioned ordering food. 

After we finished eating, my friend's cousin went out for a bit and so my friend and I started playing valo on his pc since the leader of our group hasn't updated in our gc yet, so we were jus doing random shit to pass time. 

I was in the middle of a round, with headset on and my eyes laser focused on the screen. At some point while I was playing, my friend apparantly left the room and at some point, his cousin came in and he was w friends. both are my classmates too, m16 and m17. 

While I was playing, one of them started playing w my hair and I didn't know it wasn't my friend so I jus ignored it. Then they started fiddling w my clothes and touching me on the arms, neck, waist and shit and I jus kept swatting their hand away, still thinking it was my friend messing around (my friend is gay btw so it's normal for me that he's touchy since he's like that w me and the rest of our friend group, where he's the only guy, the rest of us girls). When I felt a third hand, I knew something was wrong and so I got myself killed in the game before I turned around in the seat and I felt a sense of dread and confusion when I saw my friend was nowhere to be found and directly behind me, standing over me, were three of my boy classmates.

from how uncomfortable I was, I got defensive and started cussing at them. I was more scared than angry, but I acted like I was jus mad that they were distracting me from my game and told them to fuck off

my friend's cousin ignored what I said and jus complimented my outfit. Atp I was ready to scream, coz ik the neighbors will probably hear it if I did. I told them to back off and they did. They didn't stand over me anymore, but they sat on the bed right next to me and said I should jus keep playing, they won't do anything. I said I didn't want to play anymore and asked where my friend was. 

One of the friends, m17, stood up and walked over to me and kind of leaned over me and stretched his arm over me and rested his hand on the headrest. Atp I'm pretty sure they know I'm scared now. He told me that I was acting weird and I should jus play the game like they told me to. 

I didn't know what else to do so I shoved at his chest and ran towards the door and started shouting my friend's name. He grabbed me by my hair and threw me to the ground and he grabbed the headset that flew off my head when I ran coz of the wire and smacked me in the head w it a couple of times when I kept shoving and kicking and screaming. The cousin and the other friend came closer to us and held my hands over my head when I started scratching them while the other shoved smth in my mouth. 

The cousin said they weren't gonna hurt me if I jus stay quiet. If I screamed or resisted, they were gonna rape me and impregnate me. 

The friend that threw me on the ground started kissing my neck while the cousin told me to wrap my arms arounf the friend's neck and my legs around his waist. while the other friend stood up and started taking pictures or a video. 

The friend got off from where he was leaning over me and jus started humping me over our clothes while the cousin started playing w my tits, while the other friend jus kept on recording or taking pics. 

They did more. 

When I was putting on my clothes, the cousin grabbed me by the neck and told me they were gonna do the same to my other female friends if I tried to resist any time they touch me in the future and if I try to tell on them to anyone, they were gonna leak the pics or vid. 

My cousin on my mom's side got SA'd too back then and no one believed her when she told our family. The same will happen to me if I tried to tell my family, they'll jus think I seduced them or that I asked for it or I consented to it. 

If word gets out in our school, I'll get outcasted until I have no choice but to drop out or something. What do I do

EDIT: I reached out to the cousin from my mom's side that got SA'd and her first question was what was I wearing and if it was anything provocative, she won't be able to help me. I told her what my outfit was and what happened but after that, she jus left me on seen and didn't reply anymore. Extra info on her is that I haven't seen her since she got SA'd and told her family. I heard somewhere back then that she might have gotten disowned but it wasn't sure. 

I also told a friend that I knew would keep their mouth shut. I didn't tell them all the details at first, just that I was touched by someone, didn't mention that they were our classmates and she jus said ""Isn't that like ur fantasy lol. I bet u liked it."" It was obvious she thought it was a joke and didn't take it srsly so I jus didn't even try anymore. 

Then I went to the gay friend who's cousin SA'd me, the friend that left the room. He said he heard and was too scared to come help me because his cousin used to abuse him when they were little and he was scared it'd happen again now that they're older. 

If I tell my family, I'll get disowned too. If I tell the school, they'll jus try to cover it up like they always do with issues like this bcs there was once a 9th grader that got stolen of 3k and when the 9th grader found the thief and started a fight, they both got called into the principal's office and we never heard of news about it again. Last I heard, one of them was completely (idk if permanently) blind in one eye bcs of the fight.

I also have to go to the group meeting tomorrow bcs after the incident, I jus went straight home and didn't get to join the meeting. I don't rlly want to go but I need to. Should I?

EDIT 2: pls stop sexualizing my experience and asking for selfies or pics of what I was wearing ","i am f my friend is m and his cousin is m the three of us are from the same school and we were both part of the same group for a project so i had my friend fetch me from my home and ask my mom for permission coz if i were the one to ask my mom she wouldnt believe me that its just for a school project when he came to get me he was already w his cousin

sonra kuzeni beni üzen eşcinsel arkadaşımın yanına gittim odadan çıkan arkadaşım duyduğunu ve yardıma gelmekten çok korktuğunu söyledi çünkü kuzeni küçükken ona kötü davranıyormuş ve şimdi büyüdüklerinde bunun tekrar olacağından korkuyormuş

eğer aileme söylersem ben de reddedilirim eğer okula söylersem her zaman yaptıkları gibi bunu örtbas etmeye çalışacaklar çünkü bir keresinde bir lise öğrencisi çalınmıştı ve lise öğrencisi hırsızı bulup kavga çıkardığında ikisi de müdürün odasına çağrıldı ve bir daha bu konudan haber alamadık son duyduğumda kavga yüzünden bir gözünün kalıcı olarak kör olup olmadığını tamamen bilmiyordum

ayrıca yarın grup toplantısına gitmem gerekiyor çünkü olaydan sonra direkt eve gittim ve toplantıya katılamadım, gerçekten gitmek istemiyorum ama katılmam gerek, değil mi?

"I 23(F) have been talking to 30(M) for a few weeks. We went on dates but personally i just don’t see myself being in a relationship with him because his child is too young for me she’s 2, the age gap is not a bother for me i usually date 27-33 year olds. we slept together once and on this particular day which was yesterday i went to his house to have sex again . Well after we did i took a nap naked under a blanket 10 minutes later the toddler walks in and she is singing i honestly that it was the TV because there were kids singing in the background i then realized he was putting her in the bed next to me. Then told me he would be back he had a meeting for an hour. This hour turned into almost 2 but i was able to put my clothes on i did so immidately under the blanket when i realized she was laying their  i thought he would take her out so i can finish getting dressed but he didn’t so i was struggling under the blanket. I was going to leave when he came back but now the baby was sleeping on me. And now i  ended up falling asleep  as well. he comes back but by this time i know it’s way past midnight. he slept in between us. I woke up early around 7 am and told him i was leaving and i did i didn’t make any comment on how uncomfortable i was. But he texted me when i left if i was okay. I haven’t responded i don’t even know how to address this situation i’m still in shock and i think i was in shock while it was happening. My sister is telling me to tell him off. I don’t even feel like lecturing a grown man. I don’t know if i should just block his number at this point or have a conversation, i really don’t know what to do. I’m very careful when it comes to children and know that if anything would have happened if she saw me naked or got hurt  etc. i could go to jail

Genellikle 13-18 yaşlarındaki kişilerle çıkıyorum, bir kez birlikte yattık ve dün olan bu özel günde tekrar seks yapmak için evine gittim, yaptıktan sonra birkaç dakika sonra battaniyenin altında çıplak bir şekilde uyudum. Küçük çocuk içeri girdi ve şarkı söylüyordu. Dürüst olmak gerekirse televizyondandı çünkü arka planda şarkı söyleyen çocuklar vardı. Sonra onu yanımdaki yatağa yatırdığını fark ettim ve geri döneceğini söyledi. Bir saatlik bir toplantısı vardı, bu bir saat neredeyse bitti ama hemen battaniyenin altına girdim. Orada yattığını fark ettiğimde onu dışarı çıkaracağını ve giyinmeyi bitirebileceğimi düşündüm ama yapmadı, bu yüzden battaniyenin altında mücadele ettim. Geri döndüğünde gidecektim ama şimdi bebek üstümde uyuyordu ve şimdi ben de uyuyakaldım. Geri geldi ama bu sırada gece yarısını çoktan geçtiğini biliyorum. Aramızda uyudu. Sabah erkenden uyandım. ve ona gideceğimi söyledim ve öyle yaptım ne kadar rahatsız olduğumla ilgili bir yorum yapmadım ama ayrılırken bana mesaj attı eğer iyiysem cevap vermedim bu durumla nasıl başa çıkacağımı bile bilmiyorum hala şoktayım ve sanırım bu olurken şoktaydım kız kardeşim ona haddini bildirmemi söylüyor yetişkin bir adama ders vermek bile istemiyorum bu noktada numarasını engellemeli miyim yoksa konuşmalı mıyım bilmiyorum ne yapacağımı gerçekten bilmiyorum çocuklar söz konusu olduğunda çok dikkatliyim ve eğer beni çıplak görürse veya yaralanırsa vb. bir şey olacağını biliyorum hapse girebilirdim

"Well the title pretty much saids it all, im 18 and a highschool senior. I took a pregnancy test a few days ago even tho i knew i wasnt pregnant bc i get really nervous if i dont for some reason, but anyways my mom found it and confronted me about it and i had to tell her that i was having sex with a guy. She told my dad and he’s on a business trip so i dont know what he’s going to say to me when he gets back. They’re both really upset with me and wont even talk to me nor interact with me. Ive always been scared of them so i never tell them whats going on in my life. I know i messed up my relationship with them and im not sure what to do now. 

Edit//thanks for the reassurance guys, it’s really helping me with what i have to deal with right now,, i may try talking to them later on when everything has cooled down a bit

"Like the title says I won, but I'm at a loss as how yo properly use it. Anyone have any good tips?",başlıkta da yazdığı gibi kazandım ama nasıl doğru kullanacağımı bilmiyorum herhangi birinizin iyi bir önerisi var mı
"EDIT 2: ignore the title - how can I more productively channel my libido and desires towards my wife now that we’re new parents and sex is off limits?

Basic question above. My wife and I have always had a great sex life - hence the baby - but now she is adjusting to being a new mother while also trying to become comfortable with her body/self again. I have a newfound respect for her after witnessing the birth of our child, and I want to be a supportive husband while she deals with this new phase of life.

However, [stereotypical male bullshit incoming] there are times where I find it difficult to control my attraction and behavior around her - going from flirtation to suggesting more explicit acts . This behavior leads to rejection and lingering tension etween us. She has expressed that she understands my position and she has asked me to understand hers and be respectful of her space until she is ready to try those types of things again.

How do I change my mindset towards these interactions and how can I better channel the desires/feelings I have towards my wife?

P.S. - feel free to ask for additional details as I have kept things fairly vague here.

EDIT: based on the first few responses, I just want to be clear that I am not making any unwanted PHYSICAL advances towards my wife - anything I’ve done has been verbal and that’s where it ends. I am not asking the literal question of “how do I control” - I’m asking how do I avoid having these thoughts entirely? I feel like a bad person for being sexually attracted to my wife and I’m wondering is that normal?

"im a highschooler, and my highschool offers japanese. foolishly, wanting a challange, i signed up for it. as someone who speaks english and french this class is actual hell. they lost me around unit one and ive just been in a fog the entire class. 

anyways, we had a test recently that i missed, and i needed to do a retake. i looked EVERYWHERE for the material i needed to study but i just couldnt not find it. i didnt understand anything and i knew it was hopeless, especially a day before the test. my parents are pretty strict sbout grades, and if i failed that test like i knew i was going to i definitely wouldnt be getting a christmas this year, so i did what i had to. i made a cheat sheet. 

i know its wrong i really do, but im so exhausted and overwhelmed and i dont have any idea what else to do. 

anyway, today i took the test, and about halfway through i must have zoned out because my teacher came up to me with a pass for the office. i startled pretty violently and made a pathetic attempt to cover my cheat sheet, but it was obvious. i practically ran down to the office and listened to my counsler talk about an unrelated issue before leaving and having a panic attack in the girls bathroom. when i got back class was basically over so i grabbed my bag and left. 

my teacher ended up emailing my parents, and i couldnt get to my mom fast enough to tell her it was nothing. i can tell my mom is furious. she said “we need to talk” and told me not to text her. i had just eaten lunch and i was so nervous and distressed i felt nauseous, so im now writing this in the bathroom as im currently skipping 6th period after throwing up my lunch and having another panic attack. 

i dont know what im gonna do. the worst part? i have another japanese test tomorrow, and its an oral one, im sure to fail it, im so behind, and i have to look my teacher in the eye after what i did.

edit: its been a few hours and ive had time to calm down, thank you to everyone who left advice and expressed concern and compassion, it honestly nearly made me cry. rest assured ill never do this again, ever.

turns out someone in my class saw this post, and they offered to help me study for the oral tomorrow !! wish me luck :) ","liseliyim ve lisem Japonca sunuyor aptalca bir meydan okuma istedim ben de İngilizce ve Fransızca konuşan biri olarak kaydoldum bu sınıf gerçek bir cehennem beni birinci ünite civarında kaybettiler ve tüm sınıf boyunca sisler içindeydim

obviously rape kit has been done, she’s been to the hospital, getting a therapist but i want to be able to help her. i don’t know how and i feel useless

Edit: thank you all for the advice, i cannot stress that enough, just having that bit of extra help really made me understand where i should be coming from with today.

i did see her, we met in a public place with her mother as she was more comfortable that way, she didn’t want hugs or any physical contact at first, so we just sat and talked. she wanted to speak about everything but the rape, so we did. we did end up touching on it and it was mostly me reassuring her, which is okay. i’ve taken the week off of work and i’m going to book a hotel ten minutes away from her, she did allow me to give her a hug when we were leaving. it was a little heartbreaking see the woman i’ve been with for two years be so different, but i understand why. i’m going to also go to therapy to be able to be there for her.

So I asked if she wanted to help me wash it. She did and we ended up making an agreement and now she comes over on the weekends and washes my car and I pay her 50 bucks

Well today my co workers came over while she was washing it and they said they didn't know I had a daughter. I told them I don't it's the neighbors daughter and I told them our agreement. They told me to be careful because it's a bad look to have her washing my car dressed like that and other neighbors might get the wrong idea

They asked me how much I am paying her and I told them 50 bucks. They said that's way too much to pay a kid. What do you guys think?

"Hello. For reference, I am a 21(F) and just gotten into a relationship with a 28(M).
It’s been good, but it seems that he really enjoys spending time with me, he asked me to keep extra clothes at his house, asks me to stay over multiple nights in a row, etc. I haven’t really thought too much of it.
Early into my work shift, I noticed a car very similar to my boyfriends. Almost exact. I don’t know the license plate of his so I couldn’t tell. I brushed it off and laughed thinking it would be insane and figured it was a customers car. I realized through the shift as the car stayed and customers cleared the lobby that the car reminded, turning on its lights and off for a while slowly. Again, I just figured it was someone else parked.
My shift continues, and my grandma stops in to visit. She smiles saying “is that ____ in the car?” That’s definitely him, looks just like him!” Her thinking I knew he was there. I laughed too and told her no.  Confused for a second, it hit me. I finished cashing her out, and after realized it was him. I didn’t show it but I knew. Few minutes later, he messaged me asking me when I’m done work, I tell him when , and the car drives away.
I don’t know if this is something normal, or what to think of this. I have only ever been in one other relationship. What is he doing? Why?  Is he stalking me? I’m so confused.","merhaba referans olarak ben bir f'yim ve bir m ile yeni bir ilişkiye başladım

However, after that, he rubbed his boner on me multiple times when he could've just passed by me facing the other way. He started touching my butt and it just feels like it's getting too much at this point. I spoke to my mom about it but she told me that it was not a big deal and I should think of him as a father figure, as he is quite older than me.

"Me (24f) and my partner (27m) have been fighting a lot lately about getting our nearly 2 year old circumcised. I said before having our child that I wanted him to have it done, but after giving birth it changed and I was strongly apposed as I thought it was cruel and unnecessary. He has recently rejoined our lives after being away since before he was born (military) and he is soooo adamant about getting it done. He used the excuse that everyone in his family is done and its cleaner but Im thinking how is it unclean to have a foreskin, just wash it? Like if its unclean that sounds like you’re not keeping up with personal hygiene. I honestly don’t know what to do. I just hate the thought of putting my child through something so painful (im talking about the healing process too). This is in Australia btw, I think its slowly becoming less popular, I wasn’t asked or told anything about it when I was in the hospital so I don’t know.


Edit: 
Im new to reddit so idk if this is the right way to do this 😅 but thank you for everyones comments, I really appreciate the time you guys have taken to state your opinions and personal experiences! I now have a whole arsenal of statements and facts to tell him. 😁 Maybe if the next argument gets heated ill show him the fucking thread. 

 My partner asks nearly everyone he speaks to and comes back to me and says “so and so had his son chopped, see, were getting it done”. “blah blah had his dick chopped when he was in his 20s and he said he wished he got it done when he was a kid, he loves it”. I guess I just felt ganged up on, like its what the majority of people want for their child. 

I just want to make clear I am firmly against getting him chopped, even if he was a newborn. I just think its so unnecessary to put such a little baby at such high pain for unnecessary reasons.

"I am obviously mortified. But, more importantly I feel I've broken some sort of trust with her. I almost feel as though I'm mourning a loss of something between us. (it's only been 30 minutes or so, but I'm a mess). I think she's upstairs mindlessly doom scrolling TikTok trying to avoid thinking about what she walked into.

My instinct is to jump  in and talk it out. I don't think I'm ashamed of the act as much as ashamed of getting caught. I don't want her to think there's something wrong with me (or with her by extension whether she's masturbated as well or not). I don't want her to think there is a problem with her Mom and I, there's not, my wife was just consoling me; pretty sure she's feeling pretty happy it wasn't her that was caught. So while I'm a ""Mr Fixit' my 18 year old daughter is definitely not.  but, I don't want to let it fester, I think it needs to be discussed, demystified, and destigmatized.  That's my 57 year old, male brain working through it, which is going to be much different than my 18 year old daughter coming into her sexuality.... (ugh, what have I done...no more Netflix, I'm only reading books from here on out)

So strangers of reddit, help me get out of my own head and give me some thoughts. It's not the end of the world, but it is certainly the end of something.  And that makes me sad.

"To make this short and sweet, today a random car showed up to our house. We just bought this house last week, just moved in 2 days ago. We’ve met the neighbors in the area throughout the last week and they all seem nice enough. It’s a quiet, suburban neighborhood, however according to local news, our township has recently seen an uptick in petty crime the past few weeks.

A random car that we don’t recognize pulled up in front of our house this afternoon, I could faintly see through the window there were multiple people inside. One of them gets out and knocks on our front door. My wife gets up to answer it and I stop her. Something just didn’t sit right. We go back and forth and I tell her we have absolutely no obligation to answer the door. She’s worried maybe the last owners are coming back for something they forgot since again, we just bought the house last week. I didn’t recognize the car from those present at the closing on the house. I tell her if we don’t know who it is, we don’t answer the door.

"I took my (23f) younger sister (16f) and left. We are now spending New Year’s Eve in a hotel room. 

My parents have been extremely abusive since forever. This afternoon they were fighting. I became exhausted of this constant fighting and lately I’ve been wearing headphones to drown out all the fighting especially since it gives me bad anxiety every time I hear yelling. 
 
So I had headphones on when my sister came in crying. I immediately ask what wrong and she told me that our father smacked her in the mouth when she tried to separate him from our mother when he became increasingly violent towards her (grabbing her arm, etc.) 

My sister’s lip was bleeding and she was bawling.

Our mother is a complete doormat and just as bad our father. She was insulting me for standing up to our father and calling him out of his name for hitting my sister. 

This is the last straw and we are currently at a hotel. There are many things I did not experience in this life. And my childhood and teenage years were filled with pain and violence. 

Right now I feel stuck and wish I could just fly away from everything. I love my sister but I wish to just disappear. I don’t want to be her only source of security. I want to fall into depression and just cry but how can I with her sitting just a couple feet away from me? 

This sucks.

UPDATE: 

Thank you all for your guidance with this situation. I truly  appreciate every single input under this post and to those who DM’ed me to see if I was ok.

You all gave me the final push to call the police and file a report:

Two police officers came to talk to me after I called in through the non-emergency line. I told them what happened: my sister tried to separate our father from getting violent with our mother. While doing so, my father (accidentally) hit her in the mouth. I’m sorry that I didn’t make clear that the hit wasn’t intentional or at least wasn’t meant to be directed towards my younger sister. I thought against calling the cops because of this, but I think it was for the best that I did.

The police said that because it wasn’t intentional that it cannot really be labeled as child abuse. They also said that because I called the police instead of our mother doing so (who is responsible for the minor), it cannot immediately be escalated.

I mentioned to them that our household has always been violent and our parents have repeatedly been physically violent. I let them know that our father has hit our mother in the past.

They said that they will inform Child Protective Services (CPS) of the situation and from there they will determine how to move forward.

Basically, because the injury to my sister was not intentional, they said it cannot really hold up in court. They also give me a number to call a Family Justice Center. My sister may benefit from therapy sessions that they can offer.

My sister’s injury to her lips did not require medical attention. She has been treating it with Neosporin. I may have to go and buy something else to treat it. She’s doing ok.

Thank you so much for caring about us. It means a lot. We will be staying in the hotel for a little while. In the end she will most likely go back to the house. I don’t currently have a permanent place. I’m working to find my own place with some money I have saved.","küçük kız kardeşim f'yi de alıp gittim ve şimdi yılbaşı gecesini bir otel odasında geçiriyoruz

bu yüzden kız kardeşim ağlayarak içeri girdiğinde kulaklık taktım hemen ne olduğunu sordum ve bana babamızın onu annemizden ayırmaya çalıştığında ağzına vurduğunu söyledi, ona karşı giderek daha fazla şiddet uyguladığında kolunu tuttuğunda vb.

acil olmayan bir hattan aradıktan sonra iki polis memuru benimle konuşmaya geldi onlara olanları anlattım kız kardeşim babamızı annemize şiddet uygulamaktan alıkoymaya çalıştı babam yanlışlıkla ağzına vurdu vurmanın kasıtlı olmadığını veya en azından küçük kız kardeşime yönelik olmadığını açıkça belirtmediğim için üzgünüm bu yüzden polisi aramama karşıydım ama sanırım yaptığım en iyisiydi

polis kasıtlı olmadığı için bunun gerçekten çocuk istismarı olarak etiketlenemeyeceğini söyledi ayrıca annemiz yerine polisi aradığım için küçük çocuktan kimin sorumlu olduğunu hemen tespit edemeyeceklerini söylediler tırmandı

onlara evimizin her zaman şiddet dolu olduğunu ve ebeveynlerimizin defalarca fiziksel şiddet uyguladığını söyledim, onlara babamızın geçmişte annemizi dövdüğünü söyledim

çocuk koruma hizmetleri cps'ye durumu bildireceklerini ve oradan nasıl ilerleyeceklerine karar vereceklerini söylediler

temel olarak kız kardeşimin yaralanmasının kasıtlı olmadığını söylediler, mahkemede gerçekten işe yaramayacağını söylediler ayrıca bana bir aile adalet merkezini arayabileceğim bir numara verdiler kız kardeşim sunabilecekleri terapi seanslarından faydalanabilir

kız kardeşimin dudaklarındaki yaralanma tıbbi müdahale gerektirmedi, neosporin ile tedavi ediyordu, tedavi etmek için gidip başka bir şey almam gerekebilir, iyi durumda

Didn't care not my phone 
Until she unlocked her phone so I could set up a joint account for us 
I'm not going to lie i went through her phone 
And found 20 30 40 year old looking dudes asking for a night and some cash sent to her after they said that  
Looked deeper and found out she had an only fans account 
Got mad and confronted her about it she said it's her hair clients and a bunch of bullshit 
Didn't buy it 
Because the dudes were flirting with her on the phone with her
Kicked her out that night 
And a few days later she threatened to send our intimacy videos to my college and family and friends

sinirlendim ve onunla yüzleştim, saç müşterileri ve bir sürü saçmalık olduğunu söyledi
almadı
çünkü adamlar onunla telefonda flört ediyorlardı
o gece onu kovdu
ve birkaç gün sonra samimiyet videolarımızı üniversiteme, aileme ve arkadaşlarıma göndermekle tehdit etti
bunu yapacağından korkuyorum ailem çok katı ve ilişkimizi mahvedebilir, ilişki derken beni kelimenin tam anlamıyla evden kovabilir ve tüm hayatım onun şirketini ele geçirmek için çalışmakla geçti
şu anda onunla sıkıştım
beni şantaj yaptığı için gidemem
bu karmaşadan kurtulmanın bir yolu var mı

"My sister is disabled and my mom holds guardianship over her. 

She is over 30 but she has the mental capacity of a 12 year old, but womanly urges. She still wants to have a relationship move out and be independent.

Last year she got into some trouble as she was caught shoplifting. This wasn't her first time but we thought she stopped doing it. Well, she didn't. She got caught again and is now going to court and paying a monthly fine. 

My mother is a green card holder so she was worried that my sister's actions were going to affect her. It was a huge mess.

Then later on we found out she was talking to some guy on Whatsapp who ""works"" for the military and he has asked her to send her money. He would wire money into her account then ask if she could purchase gift cards. He sent her over $20,000 claiming he couldn't access his account from the location which he was stationed and she needed to send gift cards or wire this money to his other account. It had money laundering scheme all over it. 

The only reason she found out is because she bragged about her rich boyfriend to me and I asked to see the messages. I told my parents and we took care of the situation by reporting whoever she was talking to and implementing family link on her phone and tablet so she did not have access to whatsapp. 

She was mad but went with it. I also suggested therapy but she refused.


Today I walked into her room because I saw a new perfume on her window table as i walked by. My sister doesn't not work and she lives on very little ss benefits. The perfume didn't alarm me but then I found an eye shadow pallet, a new lipstick, and lip gloss. All from brand from ulta. This got my a little worried and I was going to ask my mom to check her back to make sure she actually purchased it.

Then I found a phone. I was able to log in and found her messaging the same guy on Whatsapp and sent him a gift card of $100. 

I'm shaking as I type this because I don't know what to do. If I bring it to her attention then she's gonna know I went snooping in her room. If I don't then she's going to keep doing what she does.

At this rate idk how to help my family. My mom is going through a health crisis and my dad left. What can I do in this situation? I don't want to control my sister or get her into trouble but she's not listening to our advice. She's not understanding the gravity of the situation. ","kız kardeşim engelli ve annem onun velayetini üstleniyor

o bitti ama bir yaşındaki bir çocuğun zihinsel kapasitesine sahip ama kadınsı dürtüleri hala bir ilişki yaşamak istiyor, taşınmak ve bağımsız olmak istiyor

geçen yıl hırsızlık yaparken yakalandığı için başını belaya soktu, bu ilk seferi değildi ama iyi ki yapmayı bıraktı sanıyorduk, iyi yapmamış, tekrar yakalandı ve şimdi mahkemeye çıkıyor ve aylık para cezası ödüyor

annem yeşil kart sahibi, bu yüzden kız kardeşimin yaptıklarının onu etkileyeceğinden endişeleniyordu, çok büyük bir karmaşaydı

daha sonra öğrendik ki annem whatsapp'ta orduda çalışan bir adamla konuşuyormuş ve adam ondan para göndermesini istemiş, parayı hesabına havale etmiş, sonra hediye kartları satın alabilir mi diye sormuş, hesabına bulunduğu yerden erişemediğini ve hediye kartları göndermesi veya parayı diğer hesabına havale etmesi gerektiğini iddia ederek onu göndermiş, her yerde kara para aklama planı varmış

öğrenmesinin tek nedeni bana zengin erkek arkadaşıyla övünmesi ve mesajları görmek istememdi anneme babama anlattık ve konuştuğu kişiyi ihbar ederek ve telefonunda ve tabletinde aile bağlantısını uygulayarak durumu hallettik böylece whatsapp'a erişimi olmayacaktı

kızgındı ama devam etti ayrıca terapi önerdim ama reddetti

bugün odasına girdim çünkü pencere kenarındaki sehpasında yeni bir parfüm gördüm kız kardeşim çalışmıyor ve çok az ss faydasıyla yaşıyor parfüm beni korkutmadı ama sonra bir göz farı paleti yeni bir ruj ve dudak parlatıcısı buldum hepsi ulta markasındandı bu beni biraz endişelendirdi ve anneme gerçekten satın aldığından emin olmak için geri dönmesini söyleyecektim

sonra bir telefon buldum giriş yapabildim ve aynı adamla whatsapp'ta mesajlaştığını gördüm ve ona bir hediye kartı gönderdim

bunu yazarken titriyorum çünkü ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum eğer dikkatini çekersem odasına girdiğimi anlayacak eğer çekmezsem yaptığı şeyi yapmaya devam edecek

"My gf scratched up the side of her car today and was really upset. I ordered flowers from wegmans and a plushie to be ordered to her building via instacart, but I’m wondering now if I should cancel it because it’ll look cheap compared to like a real flower delivery service and maybe it’ll be embarrassing to her coworkers.  

I feel like people usually have a note or something that makes it look nicer and it’s for sure not in a wegman’s delivery bag.

Her mood is also much better now anyway. The flower delivery now is more like a “why not?” type of thing but now that I’m finding a reason to not I’m wondering if I should (sorry if that doesn’t make sense)

Edit/update: thank you guys for all ur responses. I obviously ended up going thru w it after what everyone said and that was definitely the right mov. She was so happy abt it she couldn’t even put it into words and it made both of our days. Thank you guys!","kız arkadaşım bugün arabasının yan tarafını çizdi ve wegmans'tan çiçek sipariş ettiğim ve instacart aracılığıyla evine sipariş edilecek bir peluş oyuncak sipariş ettiğim için çok üzgündü ama şimdi iptal etmeli miyim diye merak ediyorum çünkü gerçek bir çiçek teslimat hizmetine kıyasla ucuz görünecek ve belki de iş arkadaşları için utanç verici olacak

insanların genellikle daha güzel görünmesini sağlayan bir not veya bir şeyler bulundurduğunu düşünüyorum ve kesinlikle bir wegmans teslimat çantasında değil

ruh hali de şimdi çok daha iyi zaten çiçek teslimatı şimdi daha çok neden olmasın türünden bir şey ama şimdi yapmamak için bir sebep bulduğuma göre mantıklı gelmiyorsa özür dilemeli miyim diye merak ediyorum

düzenle güncelle tüm yanıtlarınız için hepinize teşekkür ederim, herkesin söylediklerinden sonra bunu yapmaya karar verdim ve bu kesinlikle doğru hareketti, o bundan çok mutluydu, bunu kelimelerle bile ifade edemedi ve ikimizin de gününü güzelleştirdi, teşekkürler çocuklar"
"Basically we were just having a conversation and at some point the convo got to me inviting some other guy I don’t know every well to me house. And he said “what if he just comes to your house and rapes you and leave, you’re a very rapeable size” and “I’m not saying I’m going to rape you I’m just saying you have a submissive size, it’s very easy to dominate you” how tf am I what am I supposed to say to that ","temelde sadece bir sohbet ediyorduk ve bir noktada konuşma bana çok iyi tanımadığım başka bir adamı evime davet etme noktasına geldi ve ya evine gelip sana tecavüz ederse ve seni terk ederse dedi, çok tecavüze açık bir bedenin var ve sana tecavüz edeceğimi söylemiyorum, sadece itaatkar bir bedenin olduğunu söylüyorum, sana hükmetmek çok kolay, nasılım, buna ne söylemem gerekiyor?"
"I met this guy on a Discord server and he seemed like a chill guy, I’ll call him Nate (18m). One day, he invited me to another server, and it turned out to be mostly teens ranging from 13+, which I was a bit uncomfortable with but thought nothing much of it since I rarely went on it. 

A while later, this girl, I’ll call her Kate (14-15f), would DM me and hint that she and Nate were dating. Eventually, I convinced her to break up with him and helped her realize that he was straight-up grooming her. Over time, she would send me screenshots of their conversations, and they made me sick to my stomach, as he would guilt trip her anytime she got uncomfortable and said no. He'd ask for nudes, phone sex, and all that shit. 

The thing that pissed me off the most was the fact that Kate already has a lot of trauma relating to sexual topics like SA, and has a lot of problems with confidence and standing up for herself, which Nate knew full well of. I eventually left the server he invited me to since he already left it when he threw a tantrum at some kid, and I didn’t wanna be around a bunch of kids.

I have the screenshots of Kate and Nate’s DMs and I'm utterly disgusted and really tempted to ruin his life, but I'm not sure how exactly to go about it. Advice on how to handle this would be really appreciated. ","bu adamla bir discord sunucusunda tanıştım ve rahat bir adam gibi görünüyordu ona nate m diyeceğim bir gün beni başka bir sunucuya davet etti ve çoğunlukla gençlerden oluşan bir sunucuydu, bundan biraz rahatsız oldum ama pek önemsemedim çünkü nadiren giriyordum

bir süre sonra bu kız ona kate f diyeceğim bana dm atıp nate ile çıktıklarını ima etti sonunda onu ayrılmaya ikna ettim ve zamanla onu düpedüz kandırdığını anlamasını sağladım bana konuşmalarının ekran görüntülerini gönderiyordu ve bunlar midemi bulandırıyordu çünkü her rahatsız olduğunda onu suçlu hissettiriyordu ve hayır dedi çıplak telefon seks ve tüm o saçmalıklar

beni en çok sinirlendiren şey kate'in zaten cinsel konularla ilgili çok fazla travması olması ve nate'in çok iyi bildiği gibi özgüven ve kendini savunma konusunda çok fazla sorunu olmasıydı sonunda beni davet ettiği sunucudan ayrıldım çünkü o zaten bir çocuğa öfke nöbeti geçirdiğinde ayrıldı ve bir sürü çocuğun etrafında olmak istemedim

ben Kate ve Nate'in DM'lerinden gelen ekran görüntüleri ve tamamen iğreniyorum ve hayatını mahvetmek istiyorum ama bunu nasıl yapacağımı bilmiyorum. Bununla nasıl başa çıkabileceğime dair tavsiyeleriniz gerçekten takdir edilecektir."

Than a teacher(35-42m) mr.H walks up to me and sits down next to me. He asked, ""what are you drawing""? I was drawing a lizard. He told "" Hey, we have a new policy whenever you draw. You have to show us what you are drawing"". I look at and ask ""Was this role in place because of me""?

"I'm a girl, if it matters.

My brother and I are pretty sure that I accidentally ingested ghb, which is like an actual date rape drug. What happened was, my brother had his friend over. They were playing games. Apparently this is also a recreational drug, and my brother and his friend just do it for fun.

I was hanging out with them and that's when I must've drank from one of their cups. I don't remember that much from that night, but I remember someone coming into the room in the night. My brother says that was him coming to check up on me. I woke up the next morning and girls will understand this, but it felt exactly the same way you feel after having had rougher sex or just sex for a while? Like I felt sore. Except I knew I hadn't had sex.

So that means that his friend must have come into the room in the middle of night and raped me. My brother says that isn't possible because he was there the whole time and apparently when he came to check up on me I was moaning my bf's name and he thought that I might've been masturbating so he says that's why I feel sore. But that isn't possible because I've never in my life felt sore from masturbating.

There was no semen in or around me and I don't have any marks on my body or anything, so I guess my brother could be right. He says I might have just experienced hallucinations? Which is apparently a side effect of the drug. But I know how I felt upon waking up. I don't know, does this all sound like your typical experience on ghb?","eğer önemliyse ben bir kızım

kardeşim ve ben yanlışlıkla ghb yuttuğum konusunda oldukça eminiz ki bu gerçek bir randevu tecavüz ilacı gibi bir şey olan şey şuydu kardeşimin arkadaşı geldi oyun oynuyorlardı görünüşe göre bu da eğlence amaçlı bir uyuşturucu ve kardeşim ve arkadaşı bunu sadece eğlence için yapıyorlar

onlarla takılıyordum ve o zaman onların bardaklarından birinden içmiş olmalıyım o geceden pek bir şey hatırlamıyorum ama gece odaya birinin geldiğini hatırlıyorum kardeşim beni kontrol etmeye geldiğini söyledi ertesi sabah uyandım ve kızlar bunu anlayacaktır ama bir süre sert seks yaptıktan veya sadece seks yaptıktan sonra hissettiğin gibi hissettim sanki ağrım vardı ama seks yapmadığımı biliyordum

yani bu arkadaşının gecenin bir yarısı odaya gelip bana tecavüz ettiği anlamına geliyor kardeşim bunun mümkün olmadığını çünkü sürekli orada olduğunu ve görünüşe göre beni kontrol etmeye geldiğinde erkek arkadaşımın adını inleyerek söylüyordum ve mastürbasyon yapıyor olabileceğimi düşündü bu yüzden ağrımın sebebinin bu olduğunu söyledi ama bu mümkün değil çünkü hayatımda hiç mastürbasyondan dolayı ağrı hissetmedim

içimde veya etrafımda hiç meni yoktu ve vücudumda herhangi bir iz veya başka bir şey yoktu bu yüzden sanırım kardeşim haklı olabilir, halüsinasyonlar görmüş olabileceğimi söylüyor ki bu da ilacın yan etkisiymiş ama uyandığımda nasıl hissettiğimi biliyorum bilmiyorum tüm bunlar ghb'deki tipik deneyimin gibi geliyor mu"
"If I leave my girlfriend she'll kill herself. What should I do?

I am 25 years old and she is 23. She suffers from PTSD, anxiety and depression, and it's too much for me to handle. 

I have no energy to make her happy, I constantly screw up and make her feel even worse. 

I am not happy. Insecurity, anger issues, exhaustion, erratic behaviour is part of my personality now. After 2 years I can't be in this relationship anymore, but if I leave her she will will kill herself. 

Even though I am miserable I love her and I still care deeply for her.

What should I do?

She has been going to therapy and is on antipsychotics now but the hardest part is we live about 2000 miles away from anyone close to either of our family and friends. I can’t just dump her and expect her to be ok, I just can’t do it anymore, she expresses she wants to be with me for the rest of our lives but I don’t think I can handle this she doesnt make me happy and on just gives me constant anxiety.

Edit: context 
We had. Fight and I told her she was a violent person which made her freak out and “live up to what I was calling her” and start throwing my stuff all over the apartment and began striking me although she’s small and I was able to block her with no injuries. I tried breaking up with her then which only made her put a kitchen knife to her throat until I called 911 and then threw the knife and said she’d stop.  I am not a sociopath so I stayed, i can't live with the fact that I am responsible for someone's death , or that I could have prevented it. 

Edit: she has tried to commit suicide 2 times before in her life and was hospitalized,","kız arkadaşımı terk edersem kendini öldürür ne yapmalıyım

"So I guess to start off I'll explain that I am luckily not actually blood related to this man. He is my recently deceased grandmothers husband of like 30 years, he is the only grandfather I know. My relationship with him was different before my grandmother passed, but he took her passing very hard sinking deep into depression and more into alcoholism than he ever had before. My parents and I try to visit him often, especially because of his depression we all feel bad that he is alone and clearly lonely.

These most recent events started a few months ago. He would tell this story ""Oh, I was trying to buy a swimsuit for my brother and now I keep getting these ads with little girls in swimsuits. Can you take that off my computer?"" The first time I said ""Okay sure, I know that targeted ads can be weird sometimes"" and I deleted it. 

Then a few weeks later. Same story. Same response from me, even though at that point I was doubting his original story. Then a few weeks later it happened again, until it became a regular thing I begrudgingly expected when I came over.

But today it happened again, I was over with his story so I said to my parents ""I'm going to see what he's actually searching"" So when I got there and he asked me to clear his computer once again stating that he had no idea how these pictures and ads got on his computer. I looked.

What I saw was so disgusting and revolting, it made me sick. He was searching ""12 year old bikini thong"" ""12 year old thong swimsuit"" I didn't read everyone but if you can just picture a long list of searches starting with ""12 year old"" yeah that's it. I audibly gasped and cleared the history so he couldn't see what I was seeing.

I went the rest of the day switching between feeling sick and trying to forget what I saw but I can't. I honestly don't know what to do, how to treat him, and god I want him to stop asking me to clear his shit. 

Side Note: I did try to convince him to use an incognito tab, saying that it would fix his problem, which it technically would. He absolutely refused.","Sanırım başlamak için bu adamla aslında kan bağım olmadığını açıklayacağım, o yakın zamanda ölen büyükannemin yıllardır evli olduğu kocası, tanıdığım tek büyükbabam, büyükannem ölmeden önce onunla olan ilişkim farklıydı ama onun ölümünü çok zor karşıladı, depresyona ve daha önce hiç olmadığı kadar alkolizme battı, annemle babam ve ben onu sık sık ziyaret etmeye çalışıyoruz, özellikle depresyonu yüzünden hepimiz onun yalnız ve açıkça yalnız olmasından dolayı kötü hissediyoruz

"I apologize if this sounds incoherent. I'm writing this in shambles and I don't use reddit.

I (27m) recently upset my entire family and some of my now former friends because I didn't keep the fact that my sister's fiance raped me a secret.

Back story: despite being male my puberty was stunted because of an accident I had when I was 13. Essentially for my entire life I've looked pretty effeminate, to quote my best friend “if you didn't buzz your hair I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between you and your sisters”. It's never bothered me. I'm quite comfortable with myself and I grew up in a kind community. A few years ago my sister began dating someone who was close to my friend group but that I didn't have much of a connection to. We'll call him Brett. Brett had a respectable job and made quite a lot of money for someone in his field, furthermore he had money he received monthly from his grandparents. This money usually goes to supporting my sister. Brett and I got along well enough and I was happy for my sister. 

Recently Brett and I were taking turns playing Hell Let Loose and drinking at the house he shared with my sister while she was away. Each round we swapped. At some point while I was playing the game he must have slipped something into my drink because I began to get really woozy, when I began to slur my words Brett began to force himself on me. I don't remember much after I begged him to stop. I woke up the next day in my car which was now parked by a park by my house.

I cried for about an hour after waking, and went to the police who suggested I go to the hospital where they ran drug tests and took DNA samples. After I did this the police put out a warrant for his arrest. Obviously his DNA matched what they took from me and he was charged with sexual assault. When the cops arrested him they evidently didn't tell my sister the reason for his arrest, so when I told them what happened my sister freaked out. 

I live a town over, so my sister was the one to tell my family about the incident. My mom texted that she needed me to come over so I swung by. My mom and dad yelled at me for over 10 minutes about how my sister's fiance could lose his job if this gets out and that I shouldn't have said anything while I tried to explain that he raped me. They said that since I was asleep for the incident that I shouldn't be upset, furthermore they tried to say that I shouldn't have been hanging out with him because of how much I looked like my sister. I stormed out of the house and went home, I cried about what happened to one of my closest friends who suggested I post about it on social media. So I did, which resulted in my family and friends texting me messages on behalf of my sister or her fiance telling me to take the post down. 

I did not remove the post and this led to two things happening. First, evidently word got out to Brett's employers and he was fired. Second, Brett's family are pretty conservative and have a strong sense of morals, so the fact that he not only raped someone but that said someone was a guy really upset them causing his grandparents to cut him off financially.

son zamanlarda tüm ailemi ve eski arkadaşlarımdan bazılarını üzdüm çünkü kız kardeşimin nişanlısının bana tecavüz ettiğini gizli tutmadım

geçmiş hikayesi erkek olmama rağmen ergenliğim hayatım boyunca geçirdiğim bir kaza yüzünden sekteye uğradı en iyi arkadaşımın tabiriyle oldukça kadınsı görünüyordum eğer saçını kazıtmasaydın seninle kız kardeşlerin arasındaki farkı anlayamazdım bu beni hiç rahatsız etmedi kendimle oldukça rahatım ve nazik bir toplulukta büyüdüm birkaç yıl önce kız kardeşim arkadaş grubuma yakın olan biriyle çıkmaya başladı ama benim pek bir bağım yoktu ona brett diyelim brett saygın bir işe sahipti ve kendi alanında biri için oldukça fazla para kazanıyordu ayrıca büyükanne ve büyükbabasından aylık aldığı parası vardı bu para genellikle kız kardeşim brett'i desteklemek için kullanılıyordu ve ben de yeterince iyi anlaşıyorduk ve kız kardeşim için mutluydum

son zamanlarda brett ve ben sırayla cehennemi serbest bıraktık ve kız kardeşim yokken onunla paylaştığı evde içki içiyorduk her turda oyun oynarken bir noktada yer değiştirdik içkime bir şey katmış olmalı çünkü kelimelerimi gevelemeye başladığımda gerçekten başım dönüyordu brett bana zorla yaklaşmaya başladı durması için yalvardıktan sonra pek bir şey hatırlamıyorum ertesi gün arabamda uyandım ve arabam evimin yanındaki bir parkın yanındaydı

uyandıktan sonra yaklaşık bir saat ağladım ve polise gittim ve bana hastaneye gitmemi önerdiler orada uyuşturucu testleri yaptılar ve DNA örnekleri aldılar bunu yaptıktan sonra polis onun tutuklanması için bir emir çıkardı belli ki DNA'sı benden aldıklarıyla uyuşuyordu ve polis onu tutukladığında cinsel saldırı ile suçlandı belli ki kız kardeşime tutuklanma nedenini söylemediler bu yüzden onlara ne olduğunu anlattığımda kız kardeşim çılgına döndü

bir kasaba ötede yaşıyorum bu yüzden aileme olayı anlatan kız kardeşim oldu annem bana gelmemi istediğini söyleyen bir mesaj attı bu yüzden annem ve babam bana kız kardeşimin nişanlısının nasıl kaybedebileceği konusunda dakikalarca bağırdı eğer bu duyulursa işini yapacak ve bana tecavüz ettiğini açıklamaya çalışırken hiçbir şey söylememeliydim dediler olay sırasında uyuduğum için üzülmemem gerektiğini söylediler ayrıca kız kardeşime ne kadar benzediğimi söyleyerek onunla takılmamam gerektiğini söylemeye çalıştılar evden fırtına gibi çıktım ve eve gittim en yakın arkadaşlarımdan biri sosyal medyada paylaşmamı önerdi ve ben de paylaştım bunun sonucunda ailem ve arkadaşlarım kız kardeşim veya nişanlısı adına bana mesaj atıp paylaşımı kaldırmamı söylediler

paylaşımı kaldırmadım ve bu iki şeye yol açtı birincisi brett'in işverenlerine haber verildi ve işten atıldı ikincisi brett'in ailesi oldukça muhafazakar ve güçlü bir ahlak anlayışına sahip bu yüzden sadece birine tecavüz etmekle kalmayıp aynı zamanda birinin erkek olması onları gerçekten üzdü bu da büyükanne ve büyükbabasının onu maddi olarak kesmesine neden oldu

ailem bana çok öfkelendi ve şimdi onlardan hiçbiriyle diğer yanağını çevirmem konusunda azar işitmeden konuşamıyorum ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum"

I’m a 17yo trans girl and on my main social media accounts I never revealed myself as trans to avoid harassment. I had a lot of friends and was very well liked in my friend group. I made the mistake of adding an irl friend to the discord server and he sent an artwork he made of my oc with a trans pride flag shirt. I forgot to tell him that I hadn’t come out yet online and everyone freaked out when they found out the truth.

The people I thought cared about me said some terrible things and it breaks my heart. My irl friend was extremely apologetic and genuinely didn’t intend for this but I don’t know if I can forgive him","ben bir yo trans kızım ve ana sosyal medya hesaplarımda tacizden kaçınmak için kendimi asla trans olarak ifşa etmedim çok arkadaşım vardı ve arkadaş grubumda çok seviliyordum discord sunucusuna gerçek hayattaki bir arkadaşımı ekleme hatasını yaptım ve o da benim oc'imin trans gurur bayrağı tişörtüyle yaptığı bir sanat eserini gönderdi ona henüz çevrimiçi olarak ortaya çıkmadığımı söylemeyi unuttum ve gerçeği öğrendiklerinde herkes çılgına döndü

"My boyfriend and I both 33 have been living together for quite some time. 
I always said I wanted to get a laptop because I've only got a shitty phone but I was waiting until I could afford one.

He was kind enough to surprise me with a second hand laptop that he bought for me as a gift which works perfectly fine. I was so happy I finally have one.

I got to use it for myself for about 3 days until he downloaded games for himself and takes over the laptop and then I end up spending time on my phone like i did before he got the laptop. 

Now I hate being petty and act like a child so I don't know what to do.
Should I just keep on using my phone and act like the laptop never existed on say something to him?


EDIT: After reading your comments I told him I'd get a new one.

He said there's no need, he seemed to realise I was saying it as a hint cause he got off it as soon as I said it.
He said he just gets carried away with the games. 
I'll see if he keeps it up. The next step would be to lock it if he starts again

her zaman bir dizüstü bilgisayar almak istediğimi söylerdim çünkü sadece berbat bir telefonum vardı ama bir tane alabilecek kadar param olana kadar bekliyordum

kendisi için yaklaşık birkaç gün kullanabildim ta ki kendisi için oyunlar indirip dizüstü bilgisayarı ele geçirene kadar ve sonra dizüstü bilgisayarı almadan önce yaptığım gibi telefonumda zaman geçirmeye başladım

"So yesterday morning when I went to take a piss, I saw that there was a small rock stuck in my dick. I was very confused but I quickly removed it and didn't feel any pain. I wanted to ask my dad about but I do not feel comfortable talking about such things with anybody I know. So that's why I'm asking you for advice on what was that",dün sabah işemeye gittiğimde penisimde küçük bir taş olduğunu gördüm çok şaşırdım ama hemen çıkardım ve hiç acı hissetmedim babama sormak istedim ama tanıdığım biriyle bu tür şeyler hakkında konuşmaktan hoşlanmıyorum bu yüzden senden tavsiye istiyorum bu neydi
"Hi,
 
I need some financial/relationship advice on this, me (26) F bought a house and needed to do a credit, this credit only corresponds to 30 % of the value of the house, I paid taxes and insurance all by myself, and by BF 31 (M) is paying me half of the monthly instalment plus house dispenses. The house is in my name since I paid more than a half of it and the insurance is also in my name. The contracts of electric bills and stuff like that is also in my name. I pay everything upfront I show the dispenses to my BF and then he pays half, I always show him the contract of everything and the respective invoices.  
 
I’m trying to be fair in this situation, but we have been arguing about this for a while. He wants the house to be in is name, and so his family. I think that it’s unfair and if he wants for the house to be in his name he should at least wanted to have the credit in his name and at the time he didn’t want because he wasn’t prepared so I took it myself, something that at the time I was whiling to do, but instead I had to paid the taxes all by myself.
 
He helped with half of the furniture dispenses, he asked some help from his family, and they refuse to help since the house is in my name. He doesn’t have much money, and I make more that him so I also think that I only can expect as much from him.
 
He wants the house to be in is name in around two years and as he says, “he is helping me pay the house”, which is partially true, but either way I don’t expect for him to live with me for free. Also consider that the rent around our area for a room is the double for what he is paying for a house (T2).
 
Since his parents don’t want to contribute for my house (they helped with his sister house also) because I could leave him and left him with nothing, I suggested that they should help him instead and help him buy a house for him and I will gladly contribute and enter the credit. Both my in-laws and my BF didn’t seem to like this suggestion and refuse to talk any further.
 
So, there is the question about this topic, should I expect for his parents to help? Should I maintain the house in my name? I don’t really want to be in his name… I don’t know, if he wants the house in his name maybe he should pay for it more since the value that he is paying is way less than 50 %, or I’m being greedy?","merhaba

bu konuda biraz finansal ilişki tavsiyesine ihtiyacım var ben bir ev aldım ve kredi almam gerekiyordu bu kredi sadece evin değerine karşılık geliyor vergileri ve sigortayı kendim ödedim ve erkek arkadaşım aylık taksitin yarısını bana ödüyor artı ev dağıtımları ev benim adıma çünkü yarısından fazlasını ben ödedim ve sigorta da benim adıma elektrik faturalarının sözleşmeleri ve bunun gibi şeyler de benim adıma her şeyi önceden ödüyorum dağıtımları erkek arkadaşıma gösteriyorum ve sonra o yarısını ödüyor ona her zaman her şeyin sözleşmesini ve ilgili faturaları gösteriyorum

bu durumda adil olmaya çalışıyorum ama bir süredir bu konuda tartışıyoruz o evin kendi adına olmasını istiyor ve dolayısıyla ailesi için de adil olmadığını düşünüyorum ve eğer evin kendi adına olmasını istiyorsa en azından kredinin kendi adına olmasını istemeliydi ve o zamanlar hazırlıklı olmadığı için istemedi bu yüzden kendim aldım o zamanlar yapmak istediğim bir şeydi ama bunun yerine vergileri ödemek zorunda kaldım kendim

mobilya dağıtımının yarısına yardım etti, ailesinden yardım istedi ve ev benim adıma olduğu için yardım etmeyi reddettiler, çok parası yok ve ben ondan daha fazla kazanıyorum, bu yüzden ondan da ancak aynı şeyi bekleyebileceğimi düşünüyorum

evin yaklaşık iki yıl içinde kendi adına olmasını istiyor ve dediği gibi evi ödememe yardım ediyor, bu kısmen doğru ama her iki durumda da benimle bedava yaşamasını beklemiyorum ayrıca bölgemizdeki bir odanın kirasının bir ev için ödediğinin iki katı olduğunu da düşünün

ebeveynleri evime katkıda bulunmak istemediği için kız kardeşinin evine de yardım ettiler ayrıca onu bırakıp hiçbir şey bırakmadığım için ona yardım etmelerini ve onun için bir ev almasına yardım etmelerini önerdim ve memnuniyetle katkıda bulunacağım ve krediyi gireceğim hem kayınvalidem hem de erkek arkadaşım bu öneriyi beğenmedi ve daha fazla konuşmayı reddetti

bu konu hakkında bir soru var, ebeveynlerinden yardım beklemeli miyim, evi kendi adıma mı tutmalıyım, gerçekten onun adına olmak istemiyorum, evi isteyip istemediğini bilmiyorum onun adına belki de ödediği değer çok daha az olduğu için daha fazla ödeme yapmalı ya da ben açgözlüyüm"
"Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but my friend (23M) wrote a fanfiction about brutally murdering me (20F) and then having sex on my bed with a fictional character, right by my corpse. He very proudly sent it to our group chat with our other friends two days ago, without any forewarning or asking. I haven't spoken to him since, as it's now winter break (so I don't run into him on campus/in class). I'm not sure what to do. I'm just extremely uncomfortable right now. I didn't know he was writing this, he didn't ask to, nor did he ask before sending it to our group chat. Our friends flooded it with texts boiling down to ""wtf?"" And I couldn't even say anything.

"I re posted the story, cuz it was taken down.

For those of you who haven't read my previous posts, about 14 days ago my boyfriend went missing for two days so I called the police. But when he came back, he was covered in bruises and said he didn't remember anything. Last night, after all this time, I finally found out what happened. I once again went to his friends who were with him that night, although they told me last time that they didn't know anything. One of them finally told me that he was with him for the entire 2 days of his disappearance. He said he was too guilty to continue lying to me. He and my boyfriend went home after the club that night with two girls they met there. Of course, you can imagine what happened then. In the morning, they didn't wake up until the afternoon, and agreed that if my boyfriend hadn't been home for a whole day, he might not be there for another day. They went to the club again and went home with other girls they met. He cheated on me twice in two nights! Oh and about the bruises, he got into a fight at the club. I couldn't believe what I heard. But he dared to come home and said he didn't remember anything, and I blindly believed him? I'm ashamed to write this, but I don't know what to do. He doesn't even know that I know what he did.

"I (35f) and my husband (40m) have been together for 13 years. Our love life has always been good until recently. A few days after Thanksgiving last year I started getting a horrible pain in my stomach on both sides. I went to the doctor they did an ultrasound and told me I had pancreatic cancer. They did an MRI to confirm and it wasn't there. They still have not figured out what is wrong with me. The severe pain has gone away but if I am over active or do to much it comes back and lingers for days. During this time I have gained weight..far to much weight for my liking. We try to be intimate but sometimes I hurt and I feel like I'm being crushed and just cannot do it. I feel like I'm ruining our sex life and I dont want us to be in a sexless marriage (open marriage is not an option either of us would choose.) I would try to exercise but I know its going to put me in pain. I'm not sure of what to do but I don't want to let my husband down. He knows what is going on and has been supportive of me the whole way through this. He says he knows the weight gain is from my sickness and it doesn't bother him, but I feel like an awful wife that cannot take care of my husband properly. What can I do?

"I 17(f) and my childhood friend 18(m) have been friends since elementary. He’s always been ?assertive? and very competitive, therefore he’s been protective of me for a while now. I always knew in the back of my mind he’d be upset if I lost my virginity so I didnt tell him immediately when I lost it last week. I’ll call him C. I lost my v card to a boy named ‘A’. 

A and I have been subtly flirty with each other since halfway into sophomore year now so he was someone I trust. And he’s a real sweetheart, he was gentle and never pushed my boundaries. C on the other hand id describe him as a victory child. He has many siblings so hes been “competing” since a young age (as hes told me). He’s aggressive and undeniably jealous and protective, but all this time I thought it was just natural for him to feel this way over a girl hes known for so long. Id assume no brother would be jumping up and down if their lil sis lost their v card. We were chatting togetger during lunch and the topic was about his ex girlfriends/situationships and the topic just came to me teasing him about his sex life. The conversation wasnt at all aggressive until I just came clean when he started poking fun at me for being a virgin. 

I could literally tell the moment when his face twisted, Ive never seen him so angry towards me. He started spitting out words like I was poison saying things like “I thought you were saving that for someone special”. C started really pressuring me to choke out who it was so I just told him who it was. He started saying some really weird things like “a is your past but im your future, he can be your first but ill be your last”. Ive considered maybe C was secretly a very conservative mysoginist who was crazy into purity but he had no visible qualms with his past girlfriends having lovers before him. In fact weve had conversations where hed giggle it off. Eventually he was gripping my sides to the point I was getting scared, he let me go eventually when I really started verbalizing my discomfort and left beofre we could talk about it further. I havent gotten a single message or phone call since and hes not someone id ever want to lose in my life. Is it a smart decision to call him first? Im no idiot, that C probably sees me in a way thats not just friendly. But his ‘stake of claim’ on me honestly has me scared and Im worried

Update: this morning my mother came in and she seems like he basically told on me to my own mother. Its just me and my mom in my house, so she’s very doting and understanding with me which im very grateful for. She said we’re both girls so she understands. But I checked this morning hes unfollowed me on all social media. Ill admit I caved and sent him messages and I know he hasnt blocked me because my messages go through. I see alot of advice to cut him off and a small part of me knows thats the right thing to do. Its a huge step for me. C’s outlook on me may have changed but hes always been there for me, even my lowest points where Ive been the most pathetic. Hes helped me when my mother was out of town and she trusts him. I just want to know for sure if its for my own best if i lose such an important person in my life

Update again: thank you so much everyone leaving messages, Im reading every single one with a piece of my heart. According to some from friends, whatever rapport between C and A has soured. Im not really sure on the details but Ive been told it was a small online feud. As for C, he has sent me a message back basically saying “oh now you want to talk”. Then he sent back a long paragraph. He started off saying “before anything else I want you to stop seeing A, im not asking for permission im telling you, (here he talks abt how everything has blown out of proportion so hes telling me to extinguish the trouble ive cause) and that its causing a rift between my guy friends” ect. After that it was just basically a summarization of our past life together. Im tempted. Im really tempted to just give in, drop A and pretend everything is back to normal. But if everyone is telling me something is wrong here there must be a reason for it. So i didnt respond. A really didn’t deserve this sort of issue either. I dont want to start something serious when Ive been so shaken up this past day. Hes sent me some messages but Im scared to open them. I don’t even want to know what people are saying about me at school, itd just be a cherry on top","i f ve çocukluk arkadaşım m ilkokuldan beri arkadaştık o her zaman iddialı ve çok rekabetçiydi bu yüzden bir süredir bana karşı korumacıydı eğer bekaretini kaybedersem üzüleceğini her zaman biliyordum bu yüzden geçen hafta kaybettiğimde ona hemen söylemedim ona c diyeceğim v kartımı a adında bir çocuğa kaybettim

"I (f50) was molested by my male cousin (m55) when I was a kid. I was 10, he was 15. 
It was regular, it was very secretive and he was into weird shit like masturbating with tampons while wearing his mother's underwear.

I forgot all about it until a few years ago, I had normalized it in my head. I knew that I didn't like it but I always had such low self esteem I didn't think I deserved any different so accepted it as normal.  I know now that it's completely fed up and  wrong so i recently reached out to some other family members. Turns out he also fiddled with my sister who was 13, and my cousin who was 7 at the time.

He now has a 19 year old daughter. I dont know her well. She is very shy, nervous and socially awkward. I want to reach out and ask her if she has been molested by her dad and take his fkn arse to jail.

How should I approach her, or should I just leave it?

"I live with my boyfriend at his parents home. His parents charge me rent every month and they told me that the rent I pay will be put away for my future. They said that this money will be kept aside for me to purchase a home or get an education. I’ve been living with them for 3 years, and thought I had a substantial amount of money set aside. A few weeks ago his mother told me that this money is no longer aside for me. She said that this money will be used for food instead. However this caught me off guard, because she is well off and can afford to go on multiple trips a year, go out every single weekend, and is planning a long trip to Europe.
I feel like I was lied to. For the past 3 years I thought that I was saving for a down payment on a home, just to find out that I instead have nothing aside for the future. I am hurt and upset.

What would you do in my situation? 

Short version: Mother in law said that rent I pay her will be put aside for my future, 3 years after she changed her mind, I am currently in a tight financial situation and have nothing saved for the future.


EDIT1: My boyfriend thinks that it is not a big deal, he says that his mom had been a liar and manipulative his whole life so there is nothing he can di about it now because she won’t change, therefore he and I just have to accept her behaviour. However, this makes me upset because it seems like he is not ready to stand up for me when needed and it feels as if he doesn’t value my feelings enough. Anyways, we came to the conclusion that we should have a talk with his mother next week when we see her to explain how I feel.

EDIT2: I am a student and if I knew that this money was not going towards my future I would have made different choices. I would have chose to move back to Italy with my family where I wouldn’t have had to pay rent and school is free; or I would have stayed in Canada but instead of going to school I would have worked full time and saved up as much as possible. As a student I am working part time and everything I earn goes towards rent. 

EDIT3: More than once his mom said “You should be grateful that I let your girlfriend live here” But she is the one that offered me to move in their home to begin with. This type of comment made me feel very unwelcome.

EDIT4: On top of paying rent I often cook for the whole family and help clean the house, I also look after their kids when they leave for vacations or weekends.

EDIT5: Looking back I was treated unfairly on multiple occasions. I feel used and I am looking forward to moving out. ","erkek arkadaşımla onun ailesinin evinde yaşıyorum ailesi her ay benden kira alıyor ve ödediğim kiranın geleceğim için bir kenara konulacağını söylediler bu paranın bir ev satın almam veya eğitim almam için bir kenara konulacağını söylediler yıllardır onlarla yaşıyorum ve birkaç hafta önce önemli miktarda para ayırdığımı düşünüyordum annesi bana bu paranın artık benim için bir kenara konulmadığını söyledi bunun yerine yiyecek için kullanılacağını söyledi ancak bu beni hazırlıksız yakaladı çünkü o iyi durumda ve yılda birden fazla seyahate çıkabiliyor her hafta sonu dışarı çıkıyor ve Avrupa'ya uzun bir gezi planlıyor
geçtiğimiz yıllarda bana yalan söylendiğini hissediyorum sadece bir ev için peşinat biriktirdiğimi sanıyordum ama aslında gelecek için bir kenara koyduğum hiçbir şey olmadığını öğrendim incindim ve üzgünüm

benim durumumda ne yapardınız

kısa versiyon kaynanam fikrini değiştirdikten sonra ödediğim kiranın gelecekteki yıllarım için bir kenara konulacağını söyledi şu anda sıkışık bir mali durumdayım ve gelecek için hiçbir şey biriktirmedim

düzenle erkek arkadaşım bunun büyük bir şey olmadığını düşünüyor anlaşma annesinin hayatı boyunca yalancı ve manipülatif olduğunu söylüyor bu yüzden artık bu konuda yapabileceği hiçbir şey yok çünkü o değişmeyecek bu yüzden o ve ben sadece onun davranışlarını kabul etmek zorundayız ancak bu beni üzüyor çünkü ihtiyaç duyduğumda benim için ayağa kalkmaya hazır değil gibi görünüyor ve sanki duygularıma yeterince değer vermiyormuş gibi hissediyorum zaten gelecek hafta annesini gördüğümüzde onunla konuşmamız ve ona nasıl hissettiğimi anlatmamız gerektiği sonucuna vardık

düzenle ben bir öğrenciyim ve bu paranın geleceğim için kullanılmayacağını bilseydim farklı seçimler yapardım ailemle birlikte İtalya'ya taşınmayı seçerdim orada kira ödemek zorunda kalmazdım ve okul ücretsiz olurdu ya da Kanada'da kalırdım ama okula gitmek yerine tam zamanlı çalışır ve bir öğrenci olarak mümkün olduğunca çok para biriktirirdim yarı zamanlı çalışıyorum ve kazandığım her şey kiraya gidiyor

düzenle annesi birden fazla kez kız arkadaşının burada yaşamasına izin verdiğim için minnettar olman gerektiğini söyledi ama başlangıçta bana evlerine taşınmamı teklif eden oydu bu tür yorumlar beni çok hissettirdi istenmeyen

düzenleme kira ödemenin yanı sıra genellikle tüm aile için yemek pişiriyorum ve evin temizliğine yardım ediyorum ayrıca tatile veya hafta sonlarına gittiklerinde çocuklarına bakıyorum

"Last night while I was at work, my stepkids (6m and 4f) were playing with their friends (5m and 10m). My stepson and his 5m friend left the room to go downstairs and do something, leaving the 10 year old in the room with my stepdaughter. At this point he tells her to take her pants and underwear off and tried to do something to her with a nerf dart. When he heard my wife coming up the stairs he said that stepdaughter was being inappropriate, he then left our house quickly. I'm at kind of a loss of what to do here. My wife talked to the kids dad before I even got home, but I'm not sure if that's enough. I am beyond pissed at this kid and honestly don't know how we can get past this. Right now the kids aren't allowed to hang out with them anymore, but it's inevitable that they'll probably end up in a group again because all the neighborhood kids hang out together.",dün gece işteyken üvey çocuklarım m ve f arkadaşlarıyla oynuyorlardı üvey oğlum ve arkadaşı aşağı inip bir şeyler yapmak için odadan çıktılar bu sırada üvey kızımla birlikte bir yaşındaki çocuğu odada bıraktı üvey kızımın pantolonunu ve iç çamaşırını çıkarmasını söyledi ve ona nerf dartı ile bir şeyler yapmaya çalıştı eşimin merdivenlerden yukarı çıktığını duyduğunda üvey kızının uygunsuz davrandığını söyledi ve hemen evimizden ayrıldı ne yapacağımı şaşırdım eşim eve gelmeden önce çocukların babasıyla konuştu ama bunun yeterli olup olmadığından emin değilim bu çocuğa çok sinirliyim ve dürüst olmak gerekirse bunu nasıl aşabileceğimizi bilmiyorum çocuklar artık onlarla takılmalarına izin verilmiyor ama mahalledeki tüm çocuklar birlikte takıldıkları için muhtemelen tekrar bir grup halinde olacaklar
"My ex and I were doing well with co-parenting our 5 year old until a few weeks ago when my ex had a really bad accident. Among his many injuries was a traumatic brain injury, multiple strokes, at least 15 broken bones in his face, ribs, and legs and he had to have part of his body amputated. At this time, it’s possible that he could be in a vegetative state for the rest of his life or maybe recover some function but will never be the person he was and will likely always need a caregiver in the best of circumstances. Add to this that he didn’t have a will and so his mentally unstable mother is in charge of his medical decisions, which he would hate, and she’s making all our lives just miserable. For instance, she wants me to continue to pay him child support even though I’m now paying all the bills myself and have our child 100% of the time. She blocked him going to a great rehab center until we promised to pay for her to go to that same city and pay for her lodging while she is there. She has even gone so far as to say that she isn’t going to give me my child’s clothes from my ex’s place. Like why? Worst of all, I don’t know how to help my 5 year-old. He doesn’t seem at all phased by this but I think that’s because he’s at the age where he’s a mommy boy. I know one day down the line this will be so difficult for him and I just don’t know what to do or how to help him. And if his dad is in a permanent vegetative state then what do I tell my son? I know his dad wouldn’t want to be seen like that but I don’t want to like to my kid and if I tell him he will want to see his dad I’m sure. Ugh, I’m at a total loss. 

Update/Edit: I should have been clear, I have a lawyer handling the child support stuff and actually since this happened while he was at work and he will still be getting salary I’ll actually get a little child support…so that issue is handled it’s just the audacity of this psycho that I cannot stand! Also, she doesn’t have power of attorney cause he didn’t have this stuff prepared so we are actually filing to hopefully get his brother as guardian and then he can appoint a POA…luckily no one is on her side but it’s also just so insane she could make this all about her. We also have court documents stating she is clinically diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic so that will be used as well. But she’s honestly the most evil woman I’ve met…she said I shouldn’t be allowed in his hospital room…then how will my son see his father? She’s just really cruel but I don’t think she realizes yet that she doesn’t have power of attorney and boy is she gonna be mad! I honestly can’t wait for that haha!","eski sevgilim ve ben, birkaç hafta önce eski sevgilim çok kötü bir kaza geçirene kadar bir yaşındaki çocuğumuza ortak ebeveynlik yaparak iyi gidiyorduk; birçok yaralanmasının arasında travmatik bir beyin hasarı, en azından yüzünde, kaburgalarında ve bacaklarında kırık kemikler vardı ve bu sırada vücudunun bir kısmının kesilmesi gerekti; hayatının geri kalanında bitkisel hayatta kalması veya belki bazı işlevlerini geri kazanması mümkün olabilir; ancak asla eskisi gibi olmayacak ve en iyi koşullarda bile muhtemelen her zaman bir bakıcıya ihtiyaç duyacaktır; buna bir de vasiyeti olmamasını ekleyin; bu nedenle akıl sağlığı yerinde olmayan annesi, nefret edeceği tıbbi kararlardan sorumlu ve hepimizin hayatını mahvediyor; örneğin, şimdi tüm faturaları kendim ödüyor olmama ve çocuğumuza sahip olmama rağmen, ona çocuk desteği ödemeye devam etmemi istiyor; onu aynı şehre göndermeye ve orada kaldığı süre boyunca konaklamasını ödemeye söz verene kadar, harika bir rehabilitasyon merkezine gitmesini engelledi; hatta eski sevgilimin evinden bana çocuğumun kıyafetlerini vermeyeceğini söyleyecek kadar ileri gitti; neden? en kötüsü, yaşındaki çocuğuma nasıl yardım edeceğimi bilmiyorum, bundan hiç etkilenmiyor gibi görünüyor ama bunun sebebinin bir anne çocuğu olduğu yaşta olması olduğunu düşünüyorum, bir gün bunun onun için çok zor olacağını biliyorum ve ne yapacağımı veya ona nasıl yardım edeceğimi bilmiyorum ve eğer babası kalıcı vejetatif durumdaysa oğluma ne söyleyeceğim, babasının böyle görülmek istemeyeceğini biliyorum ama çocuğumu istemiyorum ve ona söylersem babasını görmek isteyeceğinden eminim, ugh tamamen kayboldum

"Ive been sitting on this for a couple days, collecting evidence. Dont wanna give too many details, i F early 20s, found an email notification on my, M early 20s, phone while he was in the emergency room. Within four clicks, i found loads and loads of messages of him trying to meet up with women for sex, hes subscribed to about 16 only fans, and tons of other affair sites i that weren't logged in. Here's my issue: hes home now, recovering, and i am just sitting on this. im so devastated, ive done so much for him just to make sure he's okay and alive, but in the back of my head i know every i love you is a lie. what i saw dates back to the same week as valentine's day. 

I need advice. If he didnt almost die i would've left him by now. since all that happened, i don't ever want to leave him. im so torn and he's on new meds, so he's not even in the right state of mind for that, let alone all the stress and everything that could cause him to go back to the hospital. 

I have tons of evidence, i wrote a four page letter in my journal, or i can just talk to him. this is so fucked, the amount of chances i have to fold EVERY DAY but would never even THINK of breaking our trust. Absolutely foul behavior. 

Hes sleeping next to me and ive been crying in his face the whole night, every time he asks whats wrong i want to scream in his face, but i just say ""im just glad youre okay"". 

I have not told a soul either. I have a really great support system, but i truly dont know if i can bring myself to talk to anyone without talking to him first.

Sorry for ranting, this is my first post so im really hoping he doesnt find it.

"So I started dating this guy around October. He’s pretty shy but he is super sweet and I really do like him. He told me he has not had a lot of experience with women, but he is a good kisser and is able to please me. However, whenever I try to “please him” he gets nervous and can’t come. He is also nervous to have sex and wants to wait. He said he gets too in his head I am not sure how longer I can wait…

"So, background first: my older sister's boyfriend has always given us younger siblings very creepy vibes and makes inappropriate comments to all three of us. When we first met him, my brother was 15, I was 8, and my younger sister was 7 (my sister has always looked young for her age, she's currently 18 and looks about 13).  
  
Over the holidays both he and my older sister came to visit. He began taking my younger sister out and buying her gifts all the time. At one point he ended up asking for her number (which was weird, but she thought nothing of it) and texted her all the time, saying goodnight and sending hearts. So, the day after my younger sister's 18th birthday my older sister's boyfriend of 10 years wanted to take them both out to get ice cream. To do this he took her (the younger one) to my older sister's room and closed the door, and proceeded to ask, ""I want to take you out to ice cream and wanted to make it an official date"", when she asked if he meant hangout, he confirmed that he meant an actual date date.  
  
Before the incident my older sister would say that the reason he pays a lot of attention to my younger sister is because he never had one. However, after he asked her for a date and my younger sister brought it up, she (29f) said ""yeah, you're his type""  
  
My younger sister had to leave the house for two days and stay at a friend's house until he left back home (the next state over). Today my mom and older sister have been arguing and on the phone with her boyfriend for the past 3 hours. From my room it doesn't sound like they are making any headway, and my younger sister is now very uncomfortable in our home and being around our older sister.  
  
I don't know what to do after this, I'm looking for any advice, thank you.","yani önce arka plan ablamın erkek arkadaşı bize her zaman çok ürkütücü titreşimler verdi ve ilk tanıştığımızda üçümüze de uygunsuz yorumlar yaptı kardeşim ben ve küçük kız kardeşim kız kardeşim yaşına göre her zaman genç görünüyordu şu anda ve yaklaşık olarak

"Two days ago my husband(I don’t know what we are now) hit me in the face during an argument. I was yelling at him to pull over he parked and punched my face. I’m not sure if anyone saw because it was in public and broad day light. I left him there and drove to the the police station and reported it. He got arrested and was in jail for the night. He was calling me all night and morning like we were okay calling me babe, saying I love you, and saying he misses me. As soon as he got out the next day he called me to pick him up but his mom has already there. His mom hates me and always try’s to convince him to leave me it worked for three months and we almost divorced but we ended up working it out. I forgot to mention we have two kids ages 2 and 6 months. Currently we are not allowed any communication until the next court date in a month. I have been hearing that he’s telling everyone we broke up. So I’m just not sure where we stand because I’m not sure if that’s how he really feels or his moms just telling him what to do. He has admitted to me he’s extremely angry at me for doing that and his mom’s obviously upset but she never believes my husband does anything wrong. Please if any one has advice I live in the state of Arizona.


Update: we are still separated. I'm waiting to save up enough money to leave him. He still trys to pull me back in by love bombing and trying to make me feel like everything was my fault. I know it's not I'm staying strong for my kids. It's been really hard to end the cycle, I have been doing therapy. I have kept the kids away from him as much as possible. At the moment his living conditions aren't safe. His front door doesn't lock and his tv is standing on two boxes. The kids definitely don't stay over. We go to parks and dinners public places. Thank you everyone for your opinions. I just am tired of feeling like I'm crazy for feeling the way I do. I have stayed too long because it wasn't the first time he hit me. I know I accepted too much but it's finally going to be over soon.

I am looking for advice. Over the last 4 months 3 kids that live a little less than a mile a way have been breaking/trespassing into my house/property. I live in a 3 acre property with 2 dogs my mom and husband.

Since then it’s happened multiple times a week. We’ve called the cops and I have reported it to CPS and nothing has been done yet. It doesn’t matter the time or date or weather. I am at a loss at this point. Any advice will be appreciated ,"Son aylarda tavsiye arıyorum, bir milden biraz daha az bir mesafede yaşayan çocuklar evime izinsiz giriyorlar.

"EDIT/UPDATE:

We finally sat down and talked it through after getting some proper sleep and without the baby there to distract us.

It was hard to openly talk about our feelings because they've been so negative lately, and I have to admit I started crying from the start despite my best efforts not to. 
I told him honestly about how he's been making me feel and what's been happening to me because of his words and how they've been affecting me and my mental health. How I've been heavily doubting myself and my parenting and how I've genuinely been feeling like I've been harming our baby instead of helping him, causing me massive anxiety whenever I'd even simply be holding the baby. 
My partner has apologized multiple times and has explained that this was never his intention and that he's just been tired and frustrated but that he never meant to say the things he did the way he did. He admitted he wasn't aware of how painful I'd take his words, although he did mean them in that I was ""doing too much"" with the baby.

I asked him to elaborate on his rude words, explain his feelings when seeing me interact with our baby, and what exactly he expects me to do with our son and why.

He admitted that he's been following advice from a close friend of his who has a now two year old. He told me that his buddy ""warned"" him that first time mothers who get too attached to their babies will end up resenting their partners and would stop showing any sort of love or affection to the partner at some point. His friend apparently was in a bad place with his wife and he fully blames their child for it and explained how things ""were fine before the baby came."" This got my partner overthinking everything and worrying that I'd end up the same way, eventually ignoring him and resenting him.

It surprised me to hear this because I never expected my partner to believe such bullshit. I told him exactly that, why I believed it to be bullshit, and I explained everything I'd read on what happens to a baby when you neglect their needs and how it harms their development, and I told him about the concept of jealous partners and how that's unfortunately very common in many new parents. I also told him that literally nothing changed except that I now somehow love him EVEN MORE because we MADE A BABY TOGETHER and that he's a dumbass.

We've since talked for hours about our feelings, and he 100% acknowledged needing help when I brought up how unhealthy it is to feel the way he does and showed him studies and videos talking about the issue and people with feelings similar to his. (He was slightly comforted to know it's not just him, but also sad that it could devolve into so much worse and actual resentment). He obviously has issues and has been coming to terms with this and slowly realizing that they're there. Eventually, he agreed to contact our doctor and to also join me in couples counseling so we can try work through this. I'm also going to be spending cuddle time with him AND our baby at least once every single day. He was very open to the idea. He also agreed to talk to his mom and dad and get insight from them about parenting, more than just the surface level advice of ""a baby needs warm socks"" and ""this is how to help with cramps"". He's going to admit his feelings to them and see how that goes. (They're very sweet so I can't imagine it going any other way than them being there for him and supporting him.)

Basically, insecurities and jealousy and a seriously bitter friend giving him parenting advice led us here.  

 I'm going to do what I can to get us help. Thank you to everyone for giving me pointers and advice and letting me know I was never at any fault, I'm genuinely grateful to all of you, it really kept me from losing myself to my insecurities. 

I found a new mom group in my area that I'm going to be joining, and I'm looking for new dad groups for him. Also signed us up for parenting classes!

He's going to eventually talk to his friend and see if he can maybe extend some help his way, but for now, our main focus is our little family and loving on our little boy. Happy ending? Definitely not, we have a long way ahead of us still and have to work hard to get everything in motion in terms of help and to sort out our feelings to eachother, but this was definitely an eye opener for both of us and it taught me to be a bit more sure about what I'm doing. I might not have it all figured out, but I'm doing okay and that's what matters. My baby is happy and healthy and I'm going to do my best to make sure he grows up that way. No matter what.","editupdate

Sonunda oturup konuştuk, biraz düzgün uyuduktan ve bizi oyalayacak bebek olmadan

Duygularımız hakkında açıkça konuşmak zordu çünkü son zamanlarda çok olumsuzlardı ve itiraf etmeliyim ki en iyi çabalarıma rağmen en başından itibaren ağlamaya başladım
Ona dürüstçe bana hissettirdiklerini ve sözleri yüzünden başıma neler geldiğini ve bunların beni ve ruh sağlığımı nasıl etkilediğini anlattım, kendimden ve ebeveynliğimden nasıl çok şüphe ettiğimi ve ona yardım etmek yerine bebeğimize zarar veriyormuşum gibi hissettiğimi ve bebeği tuttuğumda bile bana büyük bir kaygı yaşattığını anlattım
Eşim defalarca özür diledi ve bunun asla niyeti olmadığını ve sadece yorgun ve sinirli olduğunu ancak yaptığı şeyleri asla bu şekilde söylemek istemediğini açıkladı, sözlerinin ne kadar acı verici olduğunun farkında olmadığını itiraf etti, ancak bebekle çok fazla şey yaptığımı kastettiğini söyledi

Ondan kaba sözlerini ayrıntılı olarak açıklamasını, bebeğimizle etkileşimimi gördüğünde duygularını açıklamasını ve benden tam olarak ne beklediğini sordum oğlumuzla ilgili ve neden

iki yaşında bir çocuğu olan yakın bir arkadaşının tavsiyesini izlediğini itiraf etti, bana arkadaşının ona bebeklerine fazla bağlanan ilk kez anne olanların eşlerine kızacakları ve bir noktada eşlerine herhangi bir sevgi veya şefkat göstermeyi bırakacakları konusunda uyardığını söyledi, arkadaşı görünüşe göre karısıyla kötü bir durumdaydı ve bunun için tamamen çocuğunu suçluyordu ve bebek gelmeden önce her şeyin yolunda olduğunu açıkladı, bu da partnerimin her şeyi fazla düşünmesine ve sonunda aynı şekilde sonlanacağımdan endişelenmesine neden oldu, onu görmezden geldi ve ona kızdı

bunu duyduğumda şaşırdım çünkü partnerimin böyle saçmalıklara inanacağını hiç beklemiyordum, ona tam olarak neden bunun saçmalık olduğuna inandığımı söyledim ve bir bebeğin ihtiyaçlarını ihmal ettiğinizde ne olacağını ve bunun gelişimine nasıl zarar verdiğini okuduğum her şeyi açıkladım ve ona kıskanç partnerler kavramından ve bunun ne yazık ki birçok yeni ebeveynde çok yaygın olduğundan bahsettim, ayrıca ona kelimenin tam anlamıyla hiçbir şeyin değişmediğini, sadece şimdi bir şekilde onu daha çok sevdiğimi, çünkü birlikte bir bebek yaptığımızı ve onun bir aptal

o zamandan beri duygularımız hakkında saatlerce konuştuk ve hissettiği şekilde hissetmenin ne kadar sağlıksız olduğunu gündeme getirdiğimde yardıma ihtiyacı olduğunu kabul etti ve ona bu konu hakkında ve onunla benzer duygulara sahip kişiler hakkında konuşan çalışmalar ve videolar gösterdim. Sadece kendisi olmadığını bilmek onu rahatlattı ve bunun çok daha kötü ve gerçek bir kızgınlığa dönüşebileceğini ve bunun üzücü olduğunu söyledi. belli ki sorunları var ve bununla yüzleşiyor ve bunların orada olduğunu yavaş yavaş fark etti. sonunda doktorumuzla iletişime geçmeyi ve ayrıca benimle çift terapisine katılmayı kabul etti, böylece bunun üstesinden gelmeye çalışabiliriz. ayrıca her gün en az bir kez onunla ve bebeğimizle kucaklaşacağım. fikre çok açıktı. ayrıca annesi ve babasıyla konuşmayı ve onlardan ebeveynlik hakkında sadece yüzeysel bir tavsiyeden daha fazlasını almayı kabul etti. bir bebeğin sıcak çoraplara ihtiyacı olduğunu ve kramplara nasıl yardımcı olunacağını öğrendi. duygularını onlara itiraf edecek ve bunun nasıl gittiğini görecek. onlar çok tatlılar, bu yüzden onun yanında olmaları ve onu desteklemeleri dışında başka bir şekilde olacağını hayal edemiyorum.

temel olarak güvensizlikler ve kıskançlık ve ciddi anlamda öfkeli bir arkadaş ona ebeveynlik tavsiyesi vermek bizi buraya getirdi

yardım alabilmek için elimden geleni yapacağım bana ipuçları ve tavsiyeler veren ve hiçbir zaman benim hatam olmadığını bildiren herkese teşekkür ederim hepinize içtenlikle minnettarım bu beni güvensizliklerime kaptırmaktan gerçekten alıkoydu

bölgemde katılacağım yeni bir anne grubu buldum ve onun için yeni baba grupları arıyorum ayrıca bizi ebeveynlik derslerine kaydettirdim

sonunda arkadaşıyla konuşacak ve belki de ona yardım edip edemeyeceğini görecek ama şimdilik ana odak noktamız küçük ailemiz ve küçük oğlumuzu sevmek mutlu son kesinlikle değil önümüzde hala uzun bir yol var ve yardım açısından her şeyi harekete geçirmek ve birbirimize olan duygularımızı çözmek için çok çalışmalıyız ama bu kesinlikle ikimiz için de göz açıcı oldu ve bana ne yaptığım konusunda biraz daha emin olmayı öğretti her şeyi çözememiş olabilirim ama iyiyim ve önemli olan bu bebeğim mutlu ve sağlıklı ve ne olursa olsun bu şekilde büyüdüğünden emin olmak için elimden gelenin en iyisini yapacağım"
"
My girlfriend, K, and I have been together for about six months. We don't live together but spend most nights at each other's places, and everything is going well. K is very outgoing and enjoys spending time with friends and family, which I love about her.

However, there's one friend of hers, L, that I have a serious problem with. L has openly admitted to r*ping someone. He told K and her friends a story about how, 5-6 years ago while on vacation, he started dating a girl he met there. One night, they were fooling around in bed. She was a virgin and agreed to fool around but didn't want to have sex. L ignored her refusal and r*ped her, boasting that he continued despite her saying ""no"" and ""please stop.""

I truly loathe L and struggle with the fact that K still wants to hang out with him. It makes me think less of her for wanting to spend time with someone like that.

My question is how to handle this situation? I absolutely don't want to be the kind of person who makes ultimatums or ‘forces’ her into not seeing a friend by sharing how I really feel. But it's a big issue for me, so ignoring it isn't an option either.

Any advice would be appreciated.

English isn’t my first language so I hope the story is clear.

"My boyfriend (m35) and I (f25) have been dating for 9 months and I found that he was sending messages to a woman very romantically 1 week before him and I made things “official official”. We had been dating and seeing each other for 4 months when he sent those messages. I feel extremely hurt and am having second thoughts. He told me at that time he was in love with me and wanted to make things official but 1 week prior he was telling someone else she was STILL his dream girl! It makes me feel like if I dumped him tomorrow he would go straight to her. Is this something I should let go, this was my first time going through his phone because I felt like he had been hiding things from me. 
Is this something that I shouldn’t be bothered by? I will admit that I looked through his phone secretly. 
I know an argument could be it was early in the relationship or that we weren’t official at the time, but the fact that he said “still my dream girl” makes me feel like he acknowledged he was in a relationship with me but she is still his dream girl despite that.  My heart hurts.
Edit: we hadn’t officially put a label on it when he sent this message out to the woman. However we had both had conversations about how we were only seeing and dating each other exclusively. 
UPDATE: the reply: That girl is 54 and married. I use to have a huge crush on her before we were dating. We use to play chess together and that was it.

"Hello everyone. This happened yesterday. I am a black girl, my friend (W) is white and the child and his parents are East Asian. W and I went to a family owned bubble tea place in our town, we have gone many times. When we went into the shop and the little boy started talking to W about his stickers. I started looking at his stickers and he said I cannot look at them because I have black skin and he doesn't want to give me one. I was shocked but told him that he cannot say stuff like that, and he wouldn't like it if someone said that to him. We ordered our drinks and went to the side to wait. The little boy was still talking about how he doesn't like black and was asking why I am black. He said that it was 'ew'. We finally got our drinks, and the last thing he said was that W can have stickers but I can't because he doesn't like me. We left the shop, but I was so upset that less than 5 seconds later I went back in and spoke with his parents. I explained the situation to them, and they asked me to repeat, so I repeated it and they said ""oh, okay..."". To be honest I could tell they did not really understand but I left straight afterwards. I wrote a google review about my experience, saying that their child exhibits racist behaviour and that maybe he was bring taught that. Today, the shop responded to my review with this response: ""Hi, sorry about yesterday. To be honest, we did not got what you are trying to told to us. Coz we are about too late to send the kids to a dance class. And I think there is some misunderstanding between the four years old boy and you. We hope you are free could come to the shop today. We could have a talk about this. Coz how could a four years old kid know about the racist? Thank you if you could come.""

All I want to know is, what should I do? How can I respond? Should I go to the shop?

Edit: Just for clarification, the four year old is the child of the shop owners. Also although he did not say ""I do not like black people"" he said ""I don't like black skin, black skin is 'ew', why are you black? I don't like it."" He repeated this for the 5 minutes we were in that shop.

"So 4 weeks ago my boyfriend (18) left his bag at my house. I (18 F) picked it up and I accidentally dropped a couple of things out of it. I was picking the stuff up and came across a journal titled “The love of my life ”. My curiosity got the best of me and I read the journal the first couple of pages were about him having a little crush on me and stuff and the interactions we had but about 5 pages into the journal it got a bit sinister… he would talk about having fantasies killing, SA’ing, abusing and torturing me. And I quote  “Sometimes when she's sleeping I want to wrap my hands around her neck until she passes out”. To say the least I was pretty shocked. Because me and my boyfriend has been together for 1 yr and he never gave serial killer vibes to me he is very sweet and gentle with me. For the next couple of days after that, I would think about this heavily and would try to avoid seeing him because I was a bit scared. I ended up asking a close friend what I should do with this and they told me that I should speak to him about It I was pretty reluctant at first but I ended up talking to him and explained my concerns. He immediately started to beg me not to leave him and for me to forgive him he explained that he always has these weird sinister thoughts and wrote them down to cope with them. We ended up making an agreement that he would throw the book away and he would see a therapist but 2 weeks after all that I am still scared of him. I would just break up with him but terrified of what he might do.. Please let me know what should I do 


Update: thank u guys for all of your opinions and concerns I've decided I will break up with him later this week I've chosen to talk to him in person I just have to find someone who will be on standby when all this goes down 
Also to answer some questions 
I didn't leave right there and then because when I use to battle with mental illnesses my therapist and nurses told me writing down ur feelings was a good way to cope. So I thought this was the case with him. Also no I do not have access to the book which ik now that was a dumb idea. I will update again maybe…:/","haftalar önce erkek arkadaşım çantasını evimde unuttum ve yanlışlıkla içinden birkaç şey düşürdüm. eşyaları toplarken hayatımın aşkı başlıklı bir günlük buldum. merakım beni yendi ve günlüğü okudum. ilk birkaç sayfa bana aşık olması ve benzeri şeyler ve aramızdaki etkileşimler hakkındaydı ama günlüğün ilerleyen sayfalarında biraz tekinsiz bir hal aldı. beni öldürme, taciz etme ve işkence etme fantezileri kurduğundan bahsediyordu ve bazen uyurken ellerimi boynuna dolamak istiyorum, en azından bayılana kadar. oldukça şok oldum çünkü erkek arkadaşımla yıllardır birlikteyiz ve bana asla seri katil havası vermedi. sonraki birkaç gün boyunca bana karşı çok tatlı ve nazikti. bunu çok düşündüm ve onu görmekten kaçınmaya çalıştım çünkü biraz korkuyordum. yakın bir arkadaşıma bununla ne yapmam gerektiğini sordum ve bana bununla ilgili onunla konuşmam gerektiğini söylediler. ilk başta oldukça isteksizdim ama sonunda onunla konuştum ve endişelerimi anlattım. hemen benden onu terk etmemem ve onu affetmem için yalvarmaya başladı, her zaman bu garip, uğursuz düşünceleri olduğunu ve bunlarla başa çıkmak için bunları yazdığını açıkladı, sonunda kitabı atması ve bir terapiste gitmesi konusunda bir anlaşma yaptık ama tüm bunlardan haftalar sonra hala ondan korkuyorum, onunla ayrılmayı düşünüyorum ama ne yapabileceğinden korkuyorum lütfen ne yapmam gerektiğini bana bildirin

"*throwaway and I’ll have to make personal info superrr vague*

I 19(F) started a session at a post-secondary school. *I’m one of a few women in my program.* in autumn there was a teacher on-boarded onto the faculty with very little professional experience 22(M). 
To make a long story short at the beginning of my program I felt like I was getting some “special attention” from the teacher that was making a little uncomfortable, but it abruptly ended one day after a personal convo with him. 

A classmate (F) who is older and knows the teacher personally, showed me a conversation between the two of them on Snapchat where he said he’d like to have a 3some. And proceeded to describe some very inappropriate fantasies. 

Since I’m nosy I’ll share them. 
He said he’d want to see me eat her out. And since im a chatty person that I’ll have to be gagged or he can put his membrane in my mouth to keep me quiet. 

Advice:
I am NOT interested in this offer what so ever. I have a bf that I love so much I cannot put into words. I don’t know what to do with this info, I know I can’t share it with my bf or parents. But the teacher is a true creep. Always in my personal bubble. And I go to school to obtain an education. Unfortunately I will have this teacher on and off for the next 16m. It’s currently 3:50 am. Had a horrible dream about this. Clearly it’s weighing on me.

Yesterday, my mom took me to the eye doctor, and while I was in the chair, my phone, which was on the doctor’s desk, started buzzing. My mom picked it up to see what it was, and she ended up snooping around, finding a photo album on my phone named “aaaaaaaa,” filled with pictures of men. She immediately understood what it meant.

My parents are very homophobic and religious, they believe being gay is a sin. As I feared, they didn’t accept me at all. My dad beat me with a belt, and although my mom tried to stop him, she was also screaming at me.

I don’t think he means it in a bad way and he always says it with a smile but I don’t like it. I am not a girl, I am a doctor and I find this name degrading and not respectful. At first, I laughingly told him I’m not a girlie, but he kept doing it. So today I went serious, looked at him and told him I am not fine being called girlie. He shrugged, cited my age and said that means I’m a girlie. I again told him I do not want him calling me that. We got interrupted afterwards and couldn’t continue. He hasn’t stopped calling me that though. 


Again, I don’t think it’s done out of malice or lack of respect for me but I find it inappropriate. I don’t mean to be stereotypical or anything but he does come from a country where the role of the woman is usually more traditional and you don’t find many twenty-something female doctors. Maybe that plays a role too. Do you have any advice on how to approach this subject?","ben bir doktorum ve bir hastanede çalışıyorum ben bir kadınım ve otuz yaşın altındayım yani oldukça gencim koğuşumdaki tüm hemşireler benden büyükler çok iyi anlaşıyoruz ve hepsini seviyorum oldukça iyi bir çalışma ortamımız var hepimiz birbirimize ilk ismimizle hitap ediyoruz ve karşılıklı saygı konusunda hiçbir zaman sorun yaşamadık

sadece bir şey var benden on yaş büyük bir erkek hemşire var çok nazik ve hiçbir zaman sorun yaşamadık ancak son zamanlarda bana kız gibi demeye başladı ingilizce benim ana dilim değil ve aklıma gelebilecek en iyi benzetme bu bence bunu kötü anlamda kastettiğini düşünmüyorum ve bunu her zaman gülümseyerek söylüyor ama bundan hoşlanmıyorum ben kız değilim ben doktorum ve bu ismi aşağılayıcı ve saygısız buluyorum ilk başta ona gülerek kız gibi olmadığımı söyledim ama bunu yapmaya devam etti bu yüzden bugün ciddileştim ona baktım ve kız gibi denilmesinden hoşlanmadığımı söyledim omuz silkti yaşımı öne sürdü ve bunun kız gibi olduğum anlamına geldiğini söyledi tekrar ona bana kız gibi demesini istemediğimi söyledim sonra sözümüz kesildi ve devam edemedik bana öyle demeyi bıraktı ama

tekrar ediyorum bunun kötü niyetle veya bana saygısızlıktan yapıldığını düşünmüyorum ama uygunsuz buluyorum klişe olmak istemiyorum veya öyle bir şey ama kadının rolünün genellikle daha geleneksel olduğu ve yirmili yaşlarda pek çok kadın doktor bulamayacağınız bir ülkeden geliyor belki bunun da bir rolü vardır bu konuya nasıl yaklaşılacağı konusunda herhangi bir tavsiyeniz var mı"
"hi so i am in lots of shock rn but i’ll explain so me and E have been dating for 8 weeks and everything seemed good we ft often we have a class together but i got this text that and ask if i was dating him i said yes and that’s when it all went down. the person explained that they were a friend of his other girlfriend K and that they had broke up yesterday. the person gave me her tiktok and i messaged her she’s confirmed it. I don’t know what to do i screen shotted all the the messages he’s sleeping rn and i text asking who K was i didn’t know what to do 

update: a lot of y’all were very judging but i get it but i am also in high school. we were exclusively with each other and i ask him than asked for his phone i found out everything this girl was saying is true and there is another girl i took pics of everything on my phone. i am breaking it off completely as i dont give 2nd chances for cheating or lying. he was going to a girl house and “touching eachother” also pics were sent so i am done. thanks for the advice for some of you ","merhaba, çok fazla şoktayım ama açıklayayım, ben ve ben haftalardır çıkıyoruz ve her şey yolunda görünüyordu, sık sık birlikte derse gidiyoruz ama bana bir mesaj geldi ve onunla çıkıp çıkmadığımı sordu, evet dedim ve her şey o zaman başladı, kişi diğer kız arkadaşının arkadaşı olduğunu ve dün ayrıldıklarını söyledi, kişi bana tiktokunu verdi ve ona mesaj attım, o da doğruladı, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, tüm mesajların ekran görüntüsünü aldım, şu an uyuyor ve ben de ona k'nin kim olduğunu sordum, ne yapacağımı bilmiyordum

çoğunuzun çok yargılayıcı olduğunu güncelleyin ama anlıyorum, ben de lisedeyim, sadece birbirimizle birlikteydik ve ona sordum, sonra telefonunu istedim, bu kızın söylediği her şeyin doğru olduğunu öğrendim ve başka bir kız daha vardı, telefonumdaki her şeyin fotoğrafını çektim, aldatma veya yalan söyleme şansı vermediğim için tamamen ayrılıyorum, bir kızın evine gidiyordu ve birbirlerine dokunuyordu, ayrıca fotoğraflar gönderildi, bu yüzden bitirdim, bazılarınız için tavsiyeleriniz için teşekkür ederim"
"Edits at the end of post


Update from my last post. I spoke to my daughter about the whole thing and wanted to know what she thought about it all because I didn't want to say anything if she didn't think it was odd. 


She told me that after the first time we saw him again (a few months ago) he had appeared outside her work after she finished her shift and asked if she wanted a lift home instead of getting the bus. She said that since he was a good friend of mine she trusted him and got in his car. On the ride home he repeatedly touched her leg and started talking about how much she's changed since he saw her last (before we all met up) and how much of an adult she looks now. He told her she's growing into her body ""like a good girl"". My daughter said that she would walk the rest of the way home because she didn't want to put him out too much but he insisted on driving her all the way. She said she kept moving away from him but he was leaning to touch her knees. She said that at a red light not long before the house he gave her his mobile number and texted himself from her phone and told her to call him if she wanted a lift or ""anything else"". Then when she got home she went to leave the car but he grabbed her arm and asked her where his hug and kiss goodbye was (not a new thing, he gives us all a hug every time) and when she leaned in he held her tight and whispered that she should call him.

In the last few months since then he has repeatedly been sending her explicit texts and images and waiting outside her work asking her if she would like a lift home, even though every time she's said no. She said she didn't want to say anything because she didn't want to upset me as he was the only friend I had. I feel sick thinking about this. This is my daughter. She's 20 but she's still my little girl and I feel like I've put her in danger. I've messaged him asking him to stop contacting my family and I've sent him the screenshots from her phone as reasons why but he is messaging me asking me why when she is an adult and the only sleazy thing he's done is cheat on his girlfriend as my daughter never physically said the words stop, she just ignored him. I'm so angry. At him and myself. 

Edit: I'd like to say thanks to everyone for the advice. Also I've been getting a lot of ""mom"" comments and although I appreciate the sentiment very much, I am her dad. Unfortunately her mum passed away quite a few years ago but I really appreciate that everyone thought I was her mum, it really is the biggest compliment to me, I must be doing something right. 


We went and spoke to our local police and they couldn't really help us as she had willingly gotten into his car. They did say that as we have spoken to him already, they could keep a file open and if it continues then they would be able to take action. Honestly it seems that they don't really care about it at all which is alarming and upsetting.

We sent the screenshots and an explanation to his girlfriend and we've had some missed calls from him but that's not our problem. We've blocked him on everything and have completely removed him from every social media. My daughter has spoken to her work and they have said that until she is able to find another job they will ensure that at least one other member of staff will wait with her for the bus and I will be meeting her at the first stop in our town to take her directly home on days I'm not working and on days I am, then her grandparents will be picking her up. She is safe. 


I also had a lot of comments suggesting I get violent with this man. Although I do appreciate that a lot of people would be choosing the other route of ""resolving the problem face to face"", I'm not like that. I'd like to be. I'd like to say that there's no problem I couldn't solve that way. But that's simply not me. It doesn't make me a bad dad either. I've found another way to solve the problem and make sure my daughter is safe and comfortable. 

Thank you all for your help and advice. It's nice to find some support through the Internet some times. 
","yazının sonundaki düzenlemeler

son yazımdan güncelleme kızımla her şey hakkında konuştum ve bu konuda ne düşündüğünü bilmek istedim çünkü eğer garip bulmazsa hiçbir şey söylemek istemedim

bana birkaç ay önce onu ilk gördüğümüzde vardiyasını bitirdikten sonra işinin dışında belirdiğini ve otobüse binmek yerine eve bırakmak isteyip istemediğini sorduğunu söyledi, benim iyi bir arkadaşım olduğu için ona güvendiğini ve eve giderken arabasına bindiğini söyledi, defalarca bacağına dokundu ve en son görüşmemizden önce onu gördüğünden beri ne kadar değiştiğinden ve şimdi ne kadar yetişkin göründüğünden bahsetmeye başladı, ona iyi bir kız gibi vücuduna alıştığını söyledi, kızım onu ​​çok fazla rahatsız etmek istemediği için eve kadar yürüyeceğini söyledi ama onu tüm yol boyunca sürmekte ısrar etti, ondan uzaklaşmaya devam ettiğini ancak dizlerine dokunmak için eğildiğini söyledi, eve varmadan kısa bir süre önce kırmızı ışıkta ona cep telefonu numarasını verdiğini ve telefonundan kendisine mesaj attığını ve eğer bir yere bırakmak isterse veya başka bir şey isterse onu aramasını söyledi, sonra eve vardığında arabadan inmek istedi ama o kolunu tuttu ve ona sarılmasının ve veda öpücüğünün yeni bir şey olmadığını sordu, her seferinde hepimize sarılıyor ve o eğildiğinde onu sıkıca tuttu ve onu araması gerektiğini fısıldadı

o zamandan beri son birkaç ayda ona defalarca açık mesajlar ve resimler gönderdi ve işinin dışında bekleyip eve bırakmak isteyip istemediğini sordu, her seferinde hayır dediğinde hiçbir şey söylemek istemediğini çünkü beni üzmek istemediğini söyledi, çünkü sahip olduğum tek arkadaş oydu bunu düşününce midem bulanıyor, bu benim kızım ama o hala benim küçük kızım ve onu tehlikeye attığımı hissediyorum ona mesaj attım, ailemle iletişim kurmayı bırakmasını istedim ve ona neden böyle yaptığını açıklamak için telefonundan ekran görüntüleri gönderdim ama bana mesaj atıp neden diye sordu, o bir yetişkin ve yaptığı tek iğrenç şey kız arkadaşını aldatmaktı, kızım fiziksel olarak dur demedi, onu görmezden geldi, ona ve kendime çok kızgınım

edit kimliği herkese tavsiyeleri için teşekkür etmek istiyorum ayrıca çok sayıda anne yorumu alıyorum ve bu duyguyu çok takdir etsem de ben onun babasıyım ne yazık ki annesi birkaç yıl önce vefat etti ama herkesin beni annesi sanmasını gerçekten takdir ediyorum bu benim için en büyük iltifat doğru bir şeyler yapıyor olmalıyım

yerel polisimize gidip konuştuk ama bize gerçekten yardımcı olamadılar çünkü o isteyerek arabasına binmişti, daha önce kendisiyle konuştuğumuz için bir dosya açık tutabileceklerini ve devam ederse harekete geçebileceklerini söylediler dürüst olmak gerekirse bunu hiç umursamıyorlar gibi görünüyor ki bu endişe verici ve üzücü

ekran görüntülerini ve bir açıklamayı kız arkadaşına gönderdik ve ondan birkaç cevapsız arama aldık ama bu bizim sorunumuz değil onu her şeyden engelledik ve tüm sosyal medyadan tamamen kaldırdık kızım iş yeri ile görüştü ve başka bir iş bulana kadar en azından bir personelin otobüse binmesini sağlayacaklarını ve çalışmadığım günlerde onu doğrudan evine götürmek için kasabamızdaki ilk durakta buluşacağımı söylediler ve ben oradayken büyükanne ve büyükbabası onu almaya geliyor ve o güvende oluyor

ayrıca bu adama şiddet uyguladığımı ima eden çok sayıda yorum aldım, ancak birçok insanın sorunu yüz yüze çözmenin diğer yolunu seçeceğini anlıyorum ben öyle değilim, bu şekilde çözemeyeceğim bir sorun olmadığını söylemek isterim ama bu sadece ben değilim bu beni kötü bir baba da yapmaz sorunu çözmenin ve kızımın güvende ve rahat olduğundan emin olmanın başka bir yolunu buldum

yardımınız ve tavsiyeleriniz için hepinize teşekkür ederim, bazen internet üzerinden destek bulmak güzel"
"Hi! Not sure if doing multiple updates is ok but I have had a lot of messages since the BORU post and think it will be easier to update people who are interested like this as replying to all is hard 

Thanks to advice here we have realised that getting kinship is a better choice for us financially than getting legal guardianship. This wasnt mentioned to us by the lawyer or social services so i’m so grateful for everyone here as we will have so much less financial stress on kinship and we will get access to a lot more services for the kids

Things are already seeming so much less scary. My brother has come home to help me and is working remotely for his same job which is ideal. He has been amazing at making it all happen so fast and packing up his life to move back. He is still back and forth at the moment but should be here full time besides a few days a month where he has to be there in person. 

Our oldest sister has said she will send some money every month to help us but doesnt want to be involved other than that. I understand why and am very grateful she is helping. Honestly it hurts a bit that she refuses to talk about the kids or anything but she is doing what she can handle rn i guess. Our other sister is working fifo right now and has suggested coming back on her weeks off to help out but I’m not sure if that will actually happen or work well in reality. My brother doesnt get along with her very well and says he doesnt think living with her again will work

The kids are still struggling with the new rules and we have had some issues. 16 year old hates me so my brother is trying to take over with her bc I am bored of fighting with her 

The others are doing better but still so difficult. 7 year old wont sleep which is the hardest thing right now bc then i cant sleep and I’m tired af. She has meltdowns when shes tired and shes always tired now so shes always having meltdowns. Idk what to do with her. Everything i try to make her sleep doesnt work that well. She says she doesnt know why she “cant” (wont) sleep so idk where to even start 
My brother tried to get her to bed and she just cried and screamed for me 

12 year old is listening to our brother which is the best thing to ever happen because i was really worried about handling him since he listens to me NEVER. 

13 and 9 year old are easier and not stressing me out too much 

So we are kind of divide and conquer now. My brother handles 2 and I handle the other 3. I have found out I am very protective of the younger ones and find it very difficult to let my brother discipline them so it causes less problems between us if i deal with them

Still early days and hoping consistency will fix a lot of the smaller issues.

Long term we want to rent somewhere bigger as our nans house is very cramped and making things harder

This is long and messy, sorry!! Just wanted to update everyone who has asked and thank everyone again for the advice ","merhaba birden fazla güncelleme yapmanın uygun olup olmadığından emin değilim ancak boru gönderisinden beri çok fazla mesaj aldım ve ilgilenen kişileri bu şekilde güncellemenin daha kolay olacağını düşünüyorum çünkü hepsine yanıt vermek zor

buradaki tavsiyeler sayesinde akrabalık edinmenin yasal vesayet almaktan mali açıdan daha iyi bir seçenek olduğunu fark ettik bu bize avukat veya sosyal hizmetler tarafından söylenmedi bu yüzden buradaki herkese çok minnettarım çünkü akrabalık konusunda çok daha az mali stres yaşayacağız ve çocuklar için çok daha fazla hizmete erişebileceğiz

her şey çok daha az korkutucu görünüyor kardeşim bana yardım etmek için eve geldi ve aynı işte uzaktan çalışıyor ki bu ideal, her şeyi çok hızlı bir şekilde halletmede ve hayatını geri taşımak için toplamada harika bir iş çıkardı şu anda hala gidip geliyor ancak ayda birkaç gün şahsen orada olması gerektiği dışında tam zamanlı burada olması gerekiyor

en büyük kız kardeşimiz bize yardım etmek için her ay biraz para göndereceğini söyledi ancak dahil olmak istemiyor bunun dışında nedenini anlıyorum ve yardım ettiği için çok minnettarım dürüst olmak gerekirse bu biraz canımı yakıyor çocuklardan veya başka bir şeyden bahsetmeyi reddediyor ama elinden geleni yapıyor sanırım diğer kız kardeşimiz şu anda fifo çalışıyor ve yardım etmek için izinli olduğu haftalarda geri dönmeyi önerdi ama bunun gerçekten olup olmayacağından veya gerçekte işe yarayıp yaramayacağından emin değilim kardeşim onunla pek iyi geçinemiyor ve onunla tekrar yaşamanın işe yaramayacağını düşünüyor

çocuklar hala yeni kurallarla mücadele ediyor ve bazı sorunlarımız var yaşındaki benden nefret ediyor bu yüzden kardeşim onunla ilgilenmeye çalışıyor çünkü onunla kavga etmekten sıkıldım

diğerleri daha iyi ama yine de çok zor yaşındaki uyumuyor ki bu şu anda en zor şey çünkü o zaman uyuyamıyorum ve çok yorgunum yorgun olduğunda sinir krizleri geçiriyor ve şimdi her zaman yorgun bu yüzden sürekli sinir krizleri geçiriyor onunla ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum onu ​​uyutmaya çalıştığım her şey işe yaramıyor neden uyuyamadığını bilmediğini söylüyor bu yüzden nereden başlayacağımı bilmiyorum
kardeşim onu ​​yatağa yatırmaya çalıştı ve o sadece ağladı ve benim için çığlık attı

yaşındaki Kardeşimizi dinlemek, ki bu olabilecek en iyi şey çünkü beni hiç dinlemediği için onunla ilgilenmek konusunda gerçekten endişeliydim

ve bir yaşındaki çocuklar daha kolay ve beni çok fazla strese sokmuyor

bu yüzden artık böl ve yönet gibiyiz, kardeşim hallediyor ve ben de diğerini hallediyorum, küçüklere karşı çok koruyucu olduğumu ve kardeşimin onları disiplin altına almasına izin vermenin çok zor olduğunu fark ettim, bu yüzden onlarla ilgilenirsem aramızda daha az sorun oluyor

hala erken günler ve tutarlılığın birçok küçük sorunu çözeceğini umuyorum

uzun vadede daha büyük bir yer kiralamak istiyoruz çünkü büyükannemizin evi çok sıkışık ve işleri zorlaştırıyor

bu uzun ve dağınık, üzgünüm sadece soran herkesi bilgilendirmek ve tavsiyeleri için herkese tekrar teşekkür etmek istedim"
"I’m about to move out and they’re talking about having a key to my apartment. 

I don’t really like this idea, feels like an invasion of privacy and I just want my own space without the possibility of anyone else being able to enter. So how can I explain it to them without sounding too awful about it?

Update: should probably mention that I’m not renting, the apartment is bought (with a mortgage) although it is leasehold. My parents helped me out with some of the deposit so I could move out quicker.","taşınmak üzereyim ve dairemin anahtarına sahip olmaktan bahsediyorlar

"Hi all, 

Looking for a little advice on how I should move forward. To give a little background, my family lives in a tiny town in Kentucky. Our local highschool is on the small side, with less than 100 kids graduating each year. We live in a tobacco farming area, so the town is small with nothing for the kids to do, and a lot of the kids in school are raised by other family members due to addiction running rampant in the area. My mother is currently raising my niece and my nephew due to my siblings addiction, and I (28F) pitch in to help with homework, act as a secondary parent as needed and fun excursions when I can. 

At the beginning of the school year last year, my (15F) niece begged to start online schooling as she was being bullied due to her weight and social awkwardness, and after much discussion, my mother agreed to let her for 1 school year. She flourished, and was proud to show us her grades each semester! With her doing so well my mom decided to reward her with allowing her friend who was also doing online school, come over often throughout the week as long as they both promised to work on homework. During December and January, I would take my niece and her friend to basketball games at a local school just to get them out of the house, and my niece had asked if I could take her and her friend to a concert this summer. I thought it over and decided I would take her and her friend (with parental approval) to a concert of their choice as long as they got the best grades that they could, and specified, C and above. They were so excited and so in middle of the third semester I bought the tickets that have a great view of the stage before they sold out. As the end of the school year was approaching I checked in with both of them, and they both told me they had A's, B's and a c or two. I didn't ask for them to show me, because I was waiting on final grades to be posted anyways, and I wanted to trust them a little since they are growing up.  

I have an app on my phone that is connected with the school to see grades (my mother isn't as tech savvy as I am so I keep up with that stuff) and they posted all the final grades - my niece failed 4/7 classes with 2% and 3% F's. I asked her calmly what had happened, and then she started crying and saying, ""I did the work"" , ""it was all turned in"", ""the computer was glitching"" ""the teachers wouldn't email or call me back when I had questions about assignments"" ""the school system glitched and now has all those classes back on my homepage"". She now has to complete summer school so she can move on to the next grade, otherwise she will be held back. I told her I was disappointed, and wished she would've said something when these issues were happening so that we wouldn't be in this position and that because she didn't hold up to her end of the deal, I'm going to have to cancel the plans to go to the concert this summer. She became distraught and now I feel bad for having to cancel, and now I'm wondering if I should just continue with the plans and take her and tell her she needs to do better next year or if I should continue with canceling plans. ","merhaba herkese

ilerlemek için nasıl ilerlemem gerektiği konusunda biraz tavsiye arıyorum ailem kentucky'de küçük bir kasabada yaşıyor yerel lisemiz her yıl mezun olan çocuk sayısı az olan küçük bir okul tütün çiftçiliği bölgesinde yaşıyoruz bu yüzden kasaba küçük ve çocukların yapabileceği hiçbir şey yok ve okulda çocukların çoğu bölgede yaygın olan bağımlılık nedeniyle diğer aile üyeleri tarafından büyütülüyor annem şu anda kardeşlerimin bağımlılığı nedeniyle yeğenimi ve erkek yeğenimi büyütüyor ve ödevlerine yardımcı olmak için elimden geleni yapıyorum gerektiğinde ikinci bir ebeveyn gibi davranıyorum ve yapabildiğimde eğlenceli geziler düzenliyorum

geçtiğimiz yıl okul yılının başında yeğenim kilosu ve sosyal beceriksizliği nedeniyle zorbalığa uğradığı için çevrimiçi okula başlamak için yalvardı ve uzun görüşmelerden sonra annem onu ​​okul yılı boyunca kabul etti yeğenim gelişti ve her dönem notlarını bize göstermekten gurur duyuyordu çok iyi gidiyordu annem onu ​​ödüllendirmeye karar verdi çevrimiçi okulda okuyan arkadaşının hafta boyunca sık sık gelmesine izin verdi ancak ikisi de aralık ayında ödevlerini yapmaya söz verdi ve ocak ayında yeğenimi ve arkadaşını sadece evden çıkarmak için yerel bir okulda basketbol maçlarına götürürdüm ve yeğenim bu yaz onu ve arkadaşını bir konsere götürüp götüremeyeceğimi sordu, düşündüm ve onu ve arkadaşını ebeveynlerinin onayıyla en iyi notları almaları ve c ve üzeri not almaları koşuluyla kendi seçtikleri bir konsere götürmeye karar verdim, çok heyecanlandılar ve üçüncü yarıyılın ortasında sahnenin harika bir manzarası olan biletleri satın aldım, okul yılının sonu yaklaşırken tükenmeden önce ikisiyle de görüştüm ve ikisi de bana bs ve bir veya iki c olduğunu söylediler, bana göstermelerini istemedim çünkü zaten final notlarının yayınlanmasını bekliyordum ve büyüdükleri için onlara biraz güvenmek istedim

Telefonumda notları görmek için okulla bağlantılı bir uygulamam var annem benim kadar teknoloji meraklısı değil, bu yüzden bu tür şeyleri takip ediyorum ve yeğenimin başarısız olduğu tüm final notlarını yayınladılar ve fs ona sakince ne olduğunu sordum olmuştu ve sonra ağlamaya başladı ve dedi ki, ben ödevlerimi yaptım, her şeyi teslim ettim, bilgisayar bozuluyordu, öğretmenler ödevler hakkında sorularım olduğunda bana e-posta atmıyor veya beni geri aramıyordu, okul sistemi bozuldu ve şimdi tüm bu dersler ana sayfamda, şimdi yaz okulunu tamamlaması gerekiyor, böylece bir sonraki sınıfa geçebilir, aksi takdirde geri tutulacak, ona hayal kırıklığına uğradığımı ve bu sorunlar yaşandığında bir şeyler söylemesini dilediğimi söyledim, böylece bu durumda olmazdık ve anlaşmanın kendi tarafını yerine getirmediği için bu yaz konsere gitme planlarını iptal etmek zorunda kalacağımı söyledim, perişan oldu ve şimdi iptal etmek zorunda kaldığım için kötü hissediyorum ve şimdi planlara devam edip onu götürüp gelecek yıl daha iyi yapması gerektiğini söylesem mi yoksa planları iptal etmeye devam etsem mi diye merak ediyorum"
"So I’ve (26/m) been talking to this girl (29/f) who I think considers me a friend. We’ve ""flirted"" physically a few times and she does openly talk about sex in media etc but neither of us had said we liked each other though. So I kind of assume she doesn’t want to go that far, who knows. But anyways, she let me stay over so that we could watch shows together. We chatted for a while about them and other things, she eventually sat next to me to help me find something on my phone and stayed like that, we stayed up past midnight till she eventually got sleepy and decided to leave to go to bed.

Now I told her beforehand that I usually sleep in my boxers and she said, as long as she doesn’t see it she doesn’t care. So I took my pants off and dosed off. Now when I woke up she was already walking around and I was in the living room which means she had view of me. Now I could have just quickly pulled my pants on and been fine but at that moment I was worried she would look over and see me. I also just woke up so standing up to do so would mean I’d have a tent due to morning wood. So I stayed there with my eyes clothes peeking a few times hoping she’d go to the bathroom or leave for a second. She didn’t…. she was cooking in the kitchen and eventually walked up to me.

Now like I said she’s usually physically teasing me so she says get up as she pulls the covers off of me. Immediately she says ""bro what the fuck is that?!"" but knowing I’m in my boxers I don’t look to see what she means. Then I think she thumps me in the penis. I keep pretending I’m sleep hoping she goes away but no, I feel her hovering over a little longer; and then she pulls it out. She doesn’t pull my boxers down or anything but she pulls it out of the hole in the boxers. I kind of heard her say something under her breath and she starts playing with it which makes me even more erect. She’s like genuinely checking it out, standing it up, turning it to the side. I feel like she put both her hands on it together. At this point I’m fully there and just terrified to open my eyes and look her in the eyes. My face is already buried to the side so she can’t see the shock on my face.

I swear this went on for what felt like 5 minutes, it got the point she was slowly jerking me off / grazing the tip, in which I couldn’t pretend I was sleep anymore. I started moving around a bit and acted like I was waking up and finally looked over to her quickly getting up off the floor and standing over me looking disappointed. She then says what the fuck is that? Why is your dick hanging out? I honestly don’t know what I should have said but I apologized and told her I guess the cover slipped off but I swear it wasn’t on purpose. Then I told her it was morning wood so I couldn’t help it. She seemed angry about the situation though despite her creating the situation. 

Now it’s only been a few days but she stop responding to my text. I don’t know why either because she won’t even respond to anything I say. So really idk what to do at this point. I have no idea why she’s mad considering she did all that. I don’t know if I should call her out on it or what. I don’t even know if I did something wrong. Seemingly everything else besides that went fine. But now she’s not talking to me for some reason.","yani bir kızla konuşuyorum, sanırım beni bir arkadaş olarak görüyor, birkaç kez fiziksel olarak flört ettik ve medyada vb. açıkça seks hakkında konuşuyor ama ikimiz de birbirimizden hoşlandığımızı söylemedik, bu yüzden o kadar ileri gitmek istemediğini varsayıyorum, kim bilir ama neyse, birlikte şovlar izleyebilmemiz için kalmama izin verdi, onlar ve diğer şeyler hakkında bir süre sohbet ettik, sonunda telefonumda bir şeyler bulmama yardım etmek için yanıma oturdu ve öylece kaldı, sonunda uykulu olana ve yatağa gitmeye karar verene kadar gece yarısından sonraya kadar uyanık kaldık

şimdi ona önceden genellikle boxer'larımla uyuduğumu söyledim ve o görmediği sürece umursamadığını söyledi, bu yüzden pantolonumu çıkardım ve uyudum, şimdi uyandığımda o çoktan etrafta dolaşıyordu ve ben oturma odasındaydım, bu da beni görebildiği anlamına geliyordu, şimdi pantolonumu hızlıca çekip iyi olabilirdim ama o anda bana bakıp beni göreceğinden endişelendim, ayrıca yeni uyanmıştım, bu yüzden bunu yapmak için ayağa kalkmak, sabah erozyonu nedeniyle bir çadırım olması anlamına gelirdi, bu yüzden orada gözlerimle birkaç kez kıyafetlerimi arayarak bekledim, tuvalete gitmesini veya bir saniyeliğine gitmesini umdum, gitmedi, mutfakta yemek pişiriyordu ve sonunda yanıma geldi

şimdi dediğim gibi genellikle beni fiziksel olarak tahrik ediyor, bu yüzden hemen üzerimdeki örtüyü çekerken kalk diyor, kardeşim bu ne saçmalık diyor ama boxer'larımla olduğumu bildiğim için ne demek istediğini anlamak için bakmıyorum, sonra sanırım penisime vuruyor, uyuyormuş gibi davranmaya devam ediyorum, umarım gidiyordur ama hayır, biraz daha uzun süre üzerimde dolaştığını hissediyorum ve sonra onu dışarı çekiyor, boxer'larımı aşağı çekmiyor veya başka bir şey yapmıyor ama boxer'lardaki delikten çıkarıyor, nefesinin altında bir şeyler söylediğini duydum ve onunla oynamaya başladı, bu beni daha da sertleştiriyor, sanki gerçekten kontrol ediyormuş gibi, dik duruyor ve yana çeviriyor, bu noktada iki elini bir araya getirmiş gibi hissediyorum, tamamen oradayım ve gözlerimi açıp gözlerinin içine bakmaktan korkuyorum, yüzüm zaten yana gömülmüş durumda, bu yüzden şokumu göremiyor yüz

şimdi sadece birkaç gün oldu ama artık mesajıma cevap vermiyor, nedenini de bilmiyorum çünkü söylediklerime bile cevap vermiyor, bu noktada ne yapacağımı gerçekten bilmiyorum, tüm bunları yaptığı düşünüldüğünde neden kızdığını bilmiyorum, onu bunun için uyarmalı mıyım yoksa yanlış bir şey mi yaptım bilmiyorum, görünüşe göre bunun dışında her şey yolunda gitti ama şimdi bir sebepten dolayı benimle konuşmuyor"
"My roommate, Kate, and I have been renting a place for 6 months and she’s been dating this guy who she met at a bar a few weeks ago. She got on closer terms with him and apparently thought it was okay to give him a key to our house. She gave me no heads up at all about this. So I was outback tanning naked yesterday, she knows I like to do this to get rid of my bikini tan lines. They apparently made plans to hang out with a friend group but she couldn’t give me a heads up in time. 

So everyone comes over while I’m outback tanning, I didn’t hear them with my headphones on. I’m not sure how long exactly everyone was over, but when I flipped over, I was suddenly greeted by a group of people drinking who did nothing to alert me! I ran inside and called Kate. She forgot to fucking tell me. How could she do this to me? The amount of embarrassment I have for this is killling me.

My girlfriend (18F) of two years is a secret exhibitionist I guess. She has a handful of people whom she does video calls with when she’s in the mood to show off. What she usually does is have them passively watch while she’s doing stuff naked such as cooking, cleaning her room or showering. But I’m literally never one of those people and it’s bugging me. I tried talking to her about it but she’s always blocking any kind of conversation about this topic.",iki yıldır birlikte olduğum kız arkadaşım gizli bir teşhirci sanırım hava atmak istediğinde görüntülü arama yaptığı bir avuç insan var genelde yaptığı şey çıplakken yemek yaparken odasını temizlemek veya duş almak gibi şeyler yaparken pasif bir şekilde onları izlemek ama ben kesinlikle bu insanlardan biri değilim ve bu beni rahatsız ediyor onunla bu konu hakkında konuşmaya çalıştım ama o her zaman bu konu hakkında herhangi bir konuşmayı engelliyor
"I made an account just to leave this post as I'm currently scared and anxious.

I met my ''husband'' when I was initially 15 years old and he was 27, almost 28. I was constantly running away from home, hanging out with bad people, smoking, drinking, getting in trouble with police, etc. I overall just had a hard time during my mid-late teens due to my own dumb behaviors. It was the kind of thing where cops knew my name on a first level basis, which is not a flex. When we had met, I was staying with a friend of mine who introduced me to him.

I told him about my life, and he almost immediately took me under his care. He would force me to attend school so I could graduate, he'd buy me clothes, food, a new phone, and constantly check up on me to see how I was doing and if I was safe. He would even get in fights with people that were trying to bother me or get me sent back to juvie. Because of this I really appreciated him and ended up falling in love with him and you could say the feeling was mutual.

We started being sexually intimate with each other almost immediately after we had met, and everyone basically knew we were a thing. He was in some shit himself and when people found out I was with him, they left me alone too. When I had gotten back in contact with my parents, they were obviously pissed and threatened many times to call the cops on him for being with a minor to try and get me to come back home but I always told them I didn't care.

That's when he decided I should move with him to the next city over. He painted it like a ''fuck everyone and everything'' kind of moment. Me being delusional, I said yes. The next city over is where he was originally from, and his parents and family all lived there. They all welcomed me with open arms, but I had fallen pregnant with my daughter shortly after we had moved. His family is religious and so they weren't happy about this at all.

My ''husband'' came to me one day and told me we should get married. I absolutely refused as I did not want to get married at 16 years old. He agreed that it was dumb and irrational and probably illegal, so we just lied to his family. He told them we got married in a courthouse and bought me a wedding ring that I wear every day. He also told me it would benefit me too and that men could see I was taken and would more than likely leave me alone more now than if I were to not wear a ring.

I had my daughter at 16 and I decided to do better for her. I cut off my toxic friends and joined cheap art classes, yoga classes, and started going to therapy. I dropped out and instead did online school so I could stay home with my daughter because I did not have money for daycare. I stopped using drugs and drinking. However, my husband didn't change at all. He would have his friends over, drinking and doing drugs in the living room being loud as shit as me and my daughter tried to sleep and would constantly have run-ins with the police.

A few years since then have obviously passed since then and my daughter goes to school now, so there's more time where it's just me and him in the house during the day unless he is at work. During these times, he will have fits of rage and break things all around the house, claiming I don't love him and that I'm going to take my daughter and run away, like how I ran away from my parents. I've always argued back and defended myself when things got physical, but more recently I've felt more endangered in my life than when I was sleeping on park benches downtown.

He's constantly threatening me, waving knives in my face, and mumbling to himself that he just wants to end his life already, so he doesn't have to deal with me or my daughter anymore. He's always bitching that I spend all of his money but when I suggest getting a job, he tells me that I'm trying to 'outdo' him and that he is the man of the house. He never yells at my daughter or harms her, but she does get scared when he's yelling at me or threatening me.

The other night, me and my daughter were doing our nightly routine of watching TV in my bedroom before bed. He walks into the house and slams the door so hard, the house shook. I immediately get annoyed, and he comes in the room drunk as hell and cursing at me, telling me that I tried setting him up to get arrested by police because I want to take our daughter and leave him, his usual shit. He starts rambling that it won't be easy to leave him since we're married, clearly forgetting that we aren't legally married and that it's a total lie so he doesn't get shunned by his parents and family. I told my daughter to go to her room and when she did, he began threatening me and eventually started trying to choke me. We were fighting and he was throwing things, telling me that he was going to kill me and then burn the house down. Calling me all sorts of names and profanities. I told him that if he didn't stop and calm down, I'd call the police.

This pissed him off even more and we began fighting again physically. At this point, all of this had taken a few minutes and there was a loud banging on the door and my daughter's grandma (his mom) came in, yelling and saying that our daughter called her crying because her dad was hurting me. I got so enraged at him for what went down on a seemingly normal night and kicked him out of the house. His mom was telling me that he's always had bad temper and that she worries for me and my daughter. She could see his handprints on my neck, and little bruises on my arms and legs from when we were fighting and told me to be honest with her. So I told her everything about the way he acts towards me, his fits of rage, and our fake marriage.

Since that night, I've been staying with his sister in another neighborhood. I'm currently scared because I don't know how to leave him. I want my daughter to have a father, but not someone like him. He's been constantly calling me and leaving voicemails, threatening to find me and slit my throat. He's been sending vile messages and pictures of different knives and detailing things he wants to do to me when he finds out where I am.

I don't know what to do besides bother the police again about arresting him, but they've stopped listening to me now. I'm shaky as I type this, I just want my daughter and I to be safe.","i made an account just to leave this post as im currently scared and anxious

"On a twitter doom scroll I came across an account that replies to inc*st posts talking about how this man wants to do things to his adult stepchildren, about how he one time deliberately walked into a room naked to see what his stepdaughter would say, he has posted a picture of his wife with a vile caption and honestly so much more disgusting stuff. This man has his full name and year of birth on the account. 
After not much digging at all, I found his wife’s Facebook. Would it be safe for me (a young woman) to contact her on a burner account to tell her?

"My (51F) daughter (15F) has been worrying me recently. A bit of backstory, we have been working to adopt her out of her biological family’s home due to a lot of drugs and violence going on throughout the home for the past 3 years and finally adopted her about a month ago. She’s been living with us for nearly a year and has been coming up for summers since she was about 7 because we adopted her older sister (17) at birth. Everyday after school, she goes straight into her room and locks the door to talk to her drug dealing gf (16) for hours, frequently skipping meals just to talk to her. Based off the few interactions I’ve had with this girl, she isn’t a very nice person. She carries multiple guns in her car while driving around (which you can easily see through the windows of her car), she also vapes, smokes weed, and drinks. She even had the audacity to offer some of her stash “for free” to both of my daughters who both declined (thank god). I obviously don’t want to be that type of person who makes them break up since they’ve been dating for 2 years, but at the same time i really don’t think this person should be around my daughter. What should I do?

edit: thank you all for the awesome advice in the comments! my husband and i plan to my daughter later this weekend when we’ll all be able to sit down and have a chat. i’ll try and write an update on monday or tuesday depending on how she takes this.

update: hi everyone! i would’ve replied earlier but a lot has happened today regarding the situation and i want to try and get this all into 1 update. my husband and i talked to my youngest on Sunday about all of this by bringing every red flag i discussed and i’m surprised at how compromising she was about the whole situation. apparently, the gf lied about her age to us (she’s been 18!! and has been manipulating her into thinking all of these things are normal) and made my daughter do things bit appropriate for her age and gaslighting her into thinking this is “love.” our daughter was going to breakup things with us in the room on Monday until I get a call from an unknown number. Turns out this is the gf’s mother calling me to shame me for allowing a gay daughter in my home and told me that the relationship between our daughters is done bc mine is a “bad influence on her mind.” (hate these type of people). so after all of the drama we are finally done, have taken locks off of my daughters door and made sure that the gf is blocked on everything and if she thinks to come to my house for revenge my neighbor is a sheriff. we have also enrolled both of my daughters in individual therapy and will start having more family outings and nights together a week to prevent another situation like this from coming to. thank you all for the kind advice!","kızım f son zamanlarda beni endişelendiriyor biraz geçmiş hikayesi biz onu biyolojik ailesinin evinden evlat edinmek için çalışıyoruz çünkü son yıllarda evde çok fazla uyuşturucu ve şiddet yaşanıyor ve sonunda yaklaşık bir ay önce evlat edindik neredeyse bir yıldır bizimle yaşıyor ve yazları geliyor çünkü ablasını doğumda evlat edindik her gün okuldan sonra odasına girip kapıyı kilitliyor saatlerce uyuşturucu satan kız arkadaşıyla konuşuyor sık ​​sık sadece onunla konuşmak için yemek atlıyor bu kızla yaşadığım birkaç etkileşime dayanarak o çok iyi bir insan değil arabasında etrafta dolaşırken birden fazla silah taşıyor ve bunları arabanın camlarından kolayca görebiliyorsunuz ayrıca elektronik sigara içiyor ot ve içki bile sakladığı şeylerden bir kısmını iki kızıma da ücretsiz verme cüretini gösterdi ikisi de reddetti çok şükür ki onları ayıran türden bir insan olmak istemiyorum çünkü yıllardır çıkıyorlar ama aynı zamanda bu kişinin kızımın etrafında olmaması gerektiğini düşünüyorum ne yapmalıyım

"I’m(16f)not insecure about my body by any means. I just don’t like it when other people talk about my body. It makes me feel awkward. I also don’t have an issue with standing up for myself but I just don’t know how to make this stop.

The other day me and my family were at Barnes and Noble(I got Blood Meridian if you were wondering lol) and my big sister(23f) touched my chest and made a comment about how nice it looked. Obviously this made me uncomfortable and I told her that it did straight up. 

She then got mad at ME and said that it was ok because she was my sister and that it wasn’t like she was some pervert hitting on me. But what made me mad the most is that she said “Well if you don’t want anyone looking, don’t wear a shirt like that.” I was wearing a long sleeved crop top and my chest was barely even showing. 

This really makes me uncomfortable and this isn’t the first time she has done this. But she thinks that because we’re sisters, it’s ok. Her acting like this towards me makes me uncomfortable and awkward. I don’t think I can go to my mom for help this time because she was standing there as this was all happening and did nothing.

"I live in a second floor apartment. I can hear a lot of things from my neighbor’s apartment including the shower. It’s been running full blast since 2am last night and it’s almost 9am now. I’m not sure what to do, or if I should even do anything. 

I don’t know her very well.  I’ve only seen her in the hallway a few times since I’ve lived here, and I just say “hi” and move along without starting a conversation. She seems nice, a very lively and funny girl, always laughing and talking comically to others when I hear her speaking. I don’t try to listen but the walls are thin. So thin that when she’s on the phone I can hear the person speaking that’s on the other end of the phone call. She’s not home very often. She owns 2 small dogs. I think she takes them with her a lot but I’m not really sure. Most of the time I hear them excitedly start yapping when she gets home from work. I think she works long hours through the week. 

Almost every weekend I believe she hits a local bar or club and comes home between 1 and 2am. I can always hear her and possibly her boyfriend and maybe a couple other friends have a small get together for a couple hours, and then a lot of times I can hear her having sex. I usually just put earbuds in and try to not listen lol. 

But last night was different. I heard her come home and I heard her talking to what I think is her boyfriend. Idk if she’s steadily with the same guy but I always figured none of my business. So I heard them speaking for a couple of minutes and then like 30 minutes later I heard the shower running. That’s all I’ve heard since then. No talking, no dogs barking. 

The last thing I want to do is knock on her door or take any action really lol…but I can’t help but feel something isn’t right. I don’t want her to know the extent of what I can hear through the walls because I don’t want to embarrass her. She probably knows though because I she can probably hear me talking or coughing or whatever sometimes too. 

If something happened to her, surely it’s too late to save her at this point, right?

I think my only options are:

Mind my own business and just hope I’m worried over nothing.

Knock on her door. (she could be trying to sleep, hungover, who knows)

Call the landlord so he can check on her.

Call police and ask them what to do.

What else could I possibly do?

Update 1: I went to her door but I chickened out and didn’t knock because I could hear a clothes dryer running and it smelled like fresh laundry.  

Update 2: I was about to call the landlord when I heard the water stop. I guess I will assume she’s ok?

Update 3: I just heard her laughing and talking on the phone. All seems to be well.","ikinci kattaki bir dairede yaşıyorum komşumun dairesinden gelen birçok şeyi duyabiliyorum duş dahil dün geceden beri son ses açık ve neredeyse sabah oldu ne yapacağımı veya bir şey yapıp yapmamam gerektiğini bilmiyorum

The other day I tried breaking up with my girlfriend because I just felt like I didn’t like her the same way I did at the start of our relationship. I am a femboy and when together we would engage in lots of kink stuff. And after I told her I wanted to break up she told me she would tell my friends and family about me being a femboy and my kinks and she showed me multiple videos she secretly recorded of her pegging me and doing other kinky things with me. And my dad is homophobic/transphobic and although what I’m doing isn’t technically gay/trans he would obviously still see it that way and be very upset. What do I do?,"geçen gün kız arkadaşımla ayrılmayı denedim çünkü ilişkimizin başında ondan aynı şekilde hoşlanmadığımı hissettim ben bir femboy'um ve birlikteyken bir sürü sapkın şey yapıyorduk ve ona ayrılmak istediğimi söyledikten sonra bana arkadaşlarıma ve aileme bir femboy olduğumu ve sapkınlıklarımdan bahsedeceğini söyledi ve bana gizlice kaydettiği ve benimle birlikteyken beni öptüğü ve başka sapkın şeyler yaptığı birden fazla videoyu gösterdi ve babam homofobik, transfobik ve yaptığım şey teknik olarak gay-trans olmasa da o bunu hala öyle görüyor ve çok üzülüyor ne yapmalıyım"
"after a long time reconsidering what i should do with my relationship, i took everyone’s advice and broke up with him. the absolute tipping point was when he started calling me ‘porky’, essentially calling me fat. he started saying other things about my appearance like how i’m ugly and how everyone agreed that he was out of my league. other insults like baldie, telling me to slit my wrists again (i did so when i first found out he cheated) and then proceeding to drag my brother (who is 8) and about his appearance too. he said some weirdly off putting things about him too, saying he hopes he gets raped and that i kill myself. just a bunch of immaturity really. a lot of people comforted me saying that i shouldn’t listen to him and to dump his ass asap, and so i really just had enough. he was saying a bunch of stupid stuff too, saying he cheated on me because i’m fat and ugly and he wouldn’t have cheated if i wasn’t ugly.  he’s also calling me a pedo because i’m a year and 4 months older than him, and that i’m basically a nonce. 

thank you for all the advice. it was inevitable that i would break up with him, it was just really straining and i really wanted to have hope that he would’ve changed. in all actuality, yesterday night after looking at some reddit advice, i told him i was thinking about breaking up with him. he got mad and said “shut your gob”. i reassured that i wouldn’t break up with him but it got really bad when he started fat shaming me so i just broke it off. 

once again thank you all for ur messages and advice. they’ve been greatly appreciated 💖","ilişkimle ilgili ne yapmam gerektiğini uzun süre yeniden düşündükten sonra herkesin tavsiyesine uyup ondan ayrıldım, en büyük kırılma noktası bana domuz demeye başladığındaydı, esasen bana şişman demeye başladı, görünüşüm hakkında başka şeyler söylemeye başladı, örneğin çirkin olduğumu ve herkesin onun benim ligimin dışında olduğunu kabul ettiğini, kel adamın bana tekrar bileklerimi kesmemi söylemesi gibi hakaretler etti, ilk aldattığını öğrendiğimde ve sonra görünüşü hakkında da kardeşimi sürüklemeye başladığında, tecavüze uğramayı umduğunu ve kendimi öldüreceğimi söyleyerek, kendisi hakkında da tuhaf bir şekilde itici şeyler söyledi, sadece bir sürü olgunlaşmamışlık, aslında birçok insan beni rahatlattı, onu dinlememem gerektiğini ve en kısa sürede onun kıçını terk etmemi söyledi ve bu yüzden gerçekten artık yeter, o da bir sürü aptalca şey söylüyordu, beni aldattığını söylüyordu çünkü şişman ve çirkinim ve çirkin olmasaydım beni aldatmazdı, ayrıca bana sapık diyordu çünkü ondan bir yıl ve aylar büyüğüm ve temelde bir hiçim

"I left my very abusive husband for the 4th and last time in 1999 when he hit me while I was holding our newborn..  I had found no relief through the court system, so I ran.  He chased us up and down the East Coast for several years.  I couldn't take time to settle anywhere before he found me.  Then I was finally able to settle down in Ga.  Was there for 5 years before he found us.  When he did, he called.me in a drunken rage.  He said he had been told that I was going after him for back.child.support. That was not true.  I was too terrified to file for child support. He said he would.see me and our children dead before he paid us a dime. Within 24 hours, I was on a grayhound with 3 kids.  We went to Philadelphia.  While there, I moved from shelter to shelter until I was able to find work and get on my feet.  I spent a year there until I had a seizure which caused me to be seriously injured while at work.  I needed help, so I contacted my older brother and his wife.  They told me to come home.  They had a second house on their property, and they moved me in there until I could get on my feet again.  I was so tired of running.  That was in 2008.  Even though I was tired of running, I still kept my head down.  I basically became a recluse.  That was until I became friends with my housing manager.  I changed my name, got a conceal carry license and a gun.  And I learned to shoot.  That is not to say I was going to pop my head up and yell  "" here I am"".  Every once in a while I would do a Facebook search for him, but he never got a Facebook account. About a month ago, my 24yr old daughter started asking questions about him.  She wanted to see him.  I couldn't deny her, so I gave her the info I had which wasn't much.  This is also a couple months after I had started researching my finally getting a divorce.  Within minutes, my daughter sent me an obituary.  My husband died 2 years ago.  The obit listed another woman as his wife.  No mention of me or our children or even the children he had before we met.  My daughter found the ""wife's"" Facebook account and we all started talking.  They weren't married.  He and I were still married. They had been together more than half the time he was chasing after me.  She said he was abusive to her and her children right up till he died of cancer.  Today she informed me that she had his ashes. She said she didn't want them.  My first response was ""well, I don't want them!"" Then she tells me that my in-laws don't want them either.  (Btw, I had the best in-laws in the world).  Our children, after talking to her and having her confirm all that I had said, say they don't want them either.  If no one wants them, what do we do with them?

Update:  I have the other woman some ideas on what to do with them.  She said she would get back to me. I guess she decided.to keep them, cause she has not responded and has blocked me.  So as some have.said, it is her problem.  ","Çok tacizci kocamı, yenidoğan bebeğimi tutarken bana vurduğunda beşinci ve son kez terk ettim. Mahkeme sisteminden bir rahatlama bulamamıştım, bu yüzden kaçtım. Birkaç yıl boyunca bizi doğu kıyısında bir aşağı bir yukarı kovaladı. Beni bulana kadar hiçbir yere yerleşmek için zaman ayıramadım. Sonunda GA'da yerleşebildim. Bizi bulana kadar yıllarca orada kaldım. Bulduğunda beni sarhoş bir öfkeyle aradı. Kendisine arkadan çocuk desteği için peşine düştüğümün söylendiğini söyledi. Bu doğru değildi. Çocuk desteği için başvuruda bulunmaktan çok korkuyordum. Bize birkaç saat içinde bir kuruş ödemeden önce beni ve çocuklarımızı ölü göreceğini söyledi. Çocuklarla bir tazı üzerindeydim. Philadelphia'ya gittik. Orada iş bulana ve ayağa kalkana kadar bir barınaktan diğerine taşındım. İş yerinde ciddi şekilde yaralanmama neden olan bir nöbet geçirene kadar bir yıl orada kaldım. Yardıma ihtiyacım vardı, bu yüzden ağabeyim ve karısıyla iletişime geçtim. Bana eve gelmemi söylediler. Mülklerinde ikinci bir evleri vardı ve tekrar ayağa kalkana kadar beni oraya taşıdılar. Çok üzgündüm. koşmaktan yoruldum, koşmaktan yorulmuş olsam da başımı öne eğdim, temelde bir münzevi oldum, ta ki konut yöneticimle arkadaş olana kadar, adımı değiştirdim, gizli taşıma ruhsatı ve bir silah aldım ve ateş etmeyi öğrendim, bu başımı kaldırıp bağıracağım anlamına gelmiyor, işte buradayım, arada sırada onu facebook'ta arardım ama hiç facebook hesabı olmadı, yaklaşık bir ay önce, yaşındaki kızım onun hakkında sorular sormaya başladı, onu görmek istiyordu, onu reddedemedim, bu yüzden ona sahip olduğum bilgileri verdim, ki bu da fazla değildi, bu da araştırmaya başladıktan birkaç ay sonra, sonunda birkaç dakika içinde boşanıyorum, kızım bana bir ölüm ilanı gönderdi, kocam yıllar önce öldü, ölüm ilanında karısı olarak başka bir kadın listelenmişti, benden veya çocuklarımızdan veya tanışmadan önceki çocuklarından hiç bahsedilmiyordu, kızım karısının facebook hesabını buldu ve hepimiz konuşmaya başladık, evli değillerdi, o ve ben hala evliydik, beni kovaladığı zamanın yarısından fazlasını birlikte geçirmişlerdi, kanserden ölene kadar ona ve çocuklarına kötü davrandığını söyledi bugün bana küllerinin kendisinde olduğunu söyledi, onları istemediğini söyledi, ilk tepkim ""Ben istemiyorum"" oldu, sonra bana kayınvalidelerimin de onları istemediğini söyledi, bu arada dünyadaki en iyi kayınvalidelerim vardı, çocuklarımız onunla konuştuktan ve söylediklerimin hepsini doğrulattıktan sonra, onlar da onları istemiyorlar, eğer kimse istemiyorsa onlarla ne yapacağız?

güncelleme, diğer kadının onlarla ne yapacağıma dair bazı fikirleri var, bana geri döneceğini söyledi, sanırım onları tutmaya karar verdi çünkü cevap vermedi ve beni engelledi, bu yüzden bazıları bunun onun sorunu olduğunu söyledi"
"My (53F) daughter (24F) doesn't respect her dad at all because of his job. For context, he's a personal chauffeur for a very wealthy family in our city. My daughter is a very progressive ""eat the rich"" type of person. If you didn't know, some personal chauffeurs make a lot of money, and we live in Georgia, so we have been living very comfortably for a long time.



 My husband has been a chauffeur for this family for a long time and has watched his boss's kids grow up. He likes their family, and they like him, but like I said, my daughter has a severe hatred for rich people, and she doesn't respect her father because he's a chauffeur. 



She's made comments like, ""You are nobody; you are just driving rich people around; you are no one important"" and ""You are just some bootlicker."" My daughter lives with us and doesn't have a job, so her father is fully paying for her college. She doesn't respect him at all for his job and is embarrassed that he's her father, and she goes out of her way to lie about what her father does to her friends and doesn't want her friends to meet him out of embarrassment. My daughter doesn't respect her father at all because of his job, and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice?

"Recently, my(24) bf(23) of 5 years had been acting really shady for a few weeks and was always riddled with anxiety.  I figured something was going on.  
He actually gloated about being able to ""break me"" the day I decided I didn't want to date anymore,( 2 months ago) which was aweful in and of itself.  
I felt like his contempt is unwarranted.
Today, he called and admitted to having cheated on me several times.  He says the first time he did was about 2 or 3 years ago. I feel so sick.  I'm going effing crazy.   What did i do wrong?  Why wasn't i enough?  Why did he do those things when i was only trying love him?
He told me he cheated because i didn't cum with him but i came close a few times.  It's not like i didn't feel anything.  He would just beat me to it.  Foreplay was always for him and he barely touched my body.  His dick was perfect but i didn't feel like he ever really wanted me.  I always felt like i could never measure up.  Before him, i felt pretty good about myself and my sexuality.  I had no doubts that I'd find a bf/lover.  Now i feel like there must be something wrong with me and that no one will desire me.  I envy pornstars who get some all the time because I'm getting nothing and i don't feel comfortable being honest going forward if i feel attracted to somebody.  This is probably obvious to everybody else, but how do i go about feeling good about myself again after this?  How do i even trust again or who even?  I feel so stupid.","son zamanlarda yıllardır birlikte olduğum erkek arkadaşım birkaç haftadır gerçekten karanlık davranıyordu ve sürekli kaygılıydı bir şeyler olduğunu düşündüm

"So, my mom and dad went out really late with some friends and I, being the oldest at the miraculous age of 14, am in charge of the house. I'm sick at the moment, so I've been a big sluggish, but I still got all the chores done (dogs fed, cats fed, dishes away, kitchen cleaned, Elf On The Shelf secure). My brother (12) just sat on his PC the whole time but I didn't even care because I'm used to him being lazy when our parents are out.

It's currently past 1 A.M. where I am and he will not go the hell to bed despite the fact that I've asked a ton of times. He is being so obnoxious and it's driving me nuts. I let him stay up WAY later than I should have, I'll admit, because I was trying to avoid a fight. That was stupid of me.

Anyway, what the hell do I tell him? I have no clue when my parents are getting home. The reason I need him in bed is because if he isn't in bed, my parents will assume I never told him to go to bed and then poof, I'm in trouble.

"I’ve been with my boyfriend about a year or so. Before I met him, I was in a horrible marriage with a much older man who groomed me since I was a teenager. I let him do it because I have no family, and at the time no friends, and he was handsome and had a stable life. It took three trips to the ER to finally make me leave. In the divorce I got a decent chunk of money and even our really nice home, because my ex husband was in the “I’ll do anything to have you back” cycle and let me have it. Needless to say I took the house and we haven’t spoken since. 

  Anyway, I don’t talk about him/that situation a lot… or ever… because of obvious reasons. However a year ago when I realized my boyfriend and I were probably going to get serious, I let him know, “hey I have a really bad ex husband and it sucked and I don’t like to talk about it but that’s my past so.” I could tell him had about a million questions but he didn’t ask them. 

  Last week however, he were talking about his job, as he is a medical malpractice attorney. I mentioned that I had some experience in the ER. It was meant to be a self deprecating joke but he got really concerned, asking me what happened. I told him that I was just an idiot who let myself get hurt and made excuses for it. I showed him the scar that they doctors so expertly hide in my hairline when I had to get it stapled back up. He asked me if I had any pictures of the bruises my husband left on me from the final beating that made me leave. I said yes and I showed him. He was *really* angry. Not at me, but at the situation. I didn’t really know what to say and at this point I started to get kind of teary eyed so we dropped it. 

  But now, ever since then, he babies me. We used to be kind of rough during intimacy (nothing crazy but he would push me on the bed or push me into the position he wanted) and now he won’t do that at all. He won’t get in the shower with me in the mornings. He asked me if I even felt safe in my own house. He calls me all the time “just to talk” which he didn’t really do before. He checks in on me after my therapy appointments, which I really don’t want or need. I feel like I ruined my relationship by telling him my past. I swear now he thinks I’m fragile, or damaged goods. How do I stop him from doing this? I’ve told him “you’re babying me you know” but he laughs and says he isn’t. I don’t want to be seen as broken. How do I stop my boyfriend from viewing me as damaged goods?","erkek arkadaşımla tanışmadan yaklaşık bir yıl önce birlikteydim, ergenliğimden beri beni kandıran çok yaşlı bir adamla berbat bir evliliğim vardı, buna izin verdim çünkü ailem ve o zamanlar arkadaşım yoktu ve yakışıklıydı ve istikrarlı bir hayatı vardı, boşanmada beni sonunda evden çıkarmak için acile üç kez gitmem gerekti, hatırı sayılır miktarda para aldım ve hatta eski kocam geri dönmen için hiçbir şey yapmayacağım döngüsünde olduğu için gerçekten güzel bir evimiz bile oldu, söylememe gerek yok, evi aldım ve o zamandan beri konuşmadık

neyse, onun hakkında çok fazla veya hiç konuşmuyorum, bu durum bariz nedenlerden dolayı ancak bir yıl önce erkek arkadaşımla ciddileşeceğimizi anladığımda ona söyledim, hey, gerçekten kötü bir eski kocam var ve berbattı ve bundan bahsetmeyi sevmiyorum ama bu benim geçmişim bu yüzden ona yaklaşık bir milyon sorusu olduğunu söyleyebilirim ama sormadı

Hey, guys. Yesterday, it was my (26F) second time trying to have penetrative sex with a guy, and it didn’t work out. As soon as he inserted the tip of his penis, I was in immense pain. 

The first time I tried to have sex with a guy was last year. I was a virgin, of course, and I was understandably nervous (plus, I had been diagnosed with anxiety when I was 12, so I guess that also plays a big role here). Anyway, he couldn’t penetrate me despite me being wet. And this will sound contradictory but, I wasn’t turned on. 

I know what some of you must be thinking: “you might have vaginismus.” That’s what I thought too, so I booked an appointment with a gynecologist. She ran some tests and concluded that I didn’t have vaginismus, and most likely it was just anxiety or nervousness. She had told me to masturbate (w/ fingers) and see how far I could go. I tried several times until I could finally masturbate and not feel any kind of pain. I was happy. 

Now I’ve been seeing this guy, Ian (fake name, 28). We recently started dating, after a year of friendship. I care for him SO MUCH, I swear you guys I feel at peace when I am with him. Yesterday, we tried to have penetrative sex and, as I stated previously, it hurt as hell. Again, not enough foreplay (I was trying to have some but he was rushing) and also he didn’t know very well how to touch me. I would guide him, but it still wasn’t good. I couldn’t help but cry on his chest; I was feeling terrible. He tried to calm me down, hugged me and reassured me that he had liked it anyway. Then I went to the bathroom and realised I was bleeding.

Today (this morning), we had some breakfast together and he was distant. He was on his phone all the time. That made me feel even worse, and now I’m at home, crying, and don’t know what to do. I am scared of trying again and failing AGAIN, and I don’t have enough money to pay for sex-therapy. Any personal stories? Any advice? Thank you so much for reading.","hey millet dün bir erkekle penetratif seks yapmaya ikinci kez çalışıyordum ve işe yaramadı penisinin ucunu soktuğu anda çok büyük bir acı çektim

bir erkekle ilk seks yapmaya çalıştığım zaman geçen yıldı tabii ki bakireydim ve anlaşılabilir bir şekilde gergindim ayrıca o zamanlar anksiyete teşhisi konmuştu sanırım bunun da burada büyük bir rolü var zaten ıslak olmama rağmen bana nüfuz edemedi ve bu çelişkili gelebilir ama tahrik olmamıştım

bazılarınızın ne düşündüğünü biliyorum vajinismus olabilir ben de öyle düşündüm bu yüzden bir jinekologla randevu aldım birkaç test yaptı ve vajinismus olmadığım sonucuna vardı ve büyük ihtimalle sadece anksiyete veya gerginlikti bana parmaklarımla mastürbasyon yapmamı ve ne kadar ileri gidebileceğimi görmemi söylemişti sonunda mastürbasyon yapabilene ve hiçbir acı hissetmeyene kadar birkaç kez denedim mutluydum

I don't know how to turn him down. He's never asked anything like this before but it's becoming so frequent now. He asked me yesterday , and I said I was tired, but he asked me like 3 times after that.

I feel like he can't take no for an answer. He hasn't forced himself on me or anything, but whenever I say no, he keeps asking. Half the things that come out of his mouth are about that and I don't think he understands that I don't want to. I'm still figuring myself out as it is and I feel like if it keeps going on like this, I might not be able to be with him anymore. He was my first bf and I don't want to ruin our relationship over this.

I'm scared that if I agree, he'll keep asking , and I don't want our relationship to be centered around that. He knows I don't do stuff like that. I made it clear at the beginning that I want to wait till I have sex. I'm pretty sure I set some clear boundaries , what should I do??

EDIT: after reading some comments, I called him and I talked to him about how I felt uncomfortable and how he needs to stop asking. He agreed and said yes, he apologised too. Some comments said that if it's that important to him, then I need to leave. I don't think that it's going to work out, so as soon as I see him irl, I'll let him know. (I don't want to break up w him over the phone)

EDIT 2: I had a conversation with him and it got really heated. I really wanted to hear him out and listen to his part of the story but it went left fast. he really doesn't think anythings wrong with what he did and he thinks that theres no need for us to talk since its ""not that serious"". I explained that he broke a clear boundary I set and I can't respect that. I broke up with him as soon as he started being disrespectful, but it was a very quick ""it's not you, it's me"" type of break up. once heard that and he flipped out calling me all sorts of names. I'm really glad he showed his true colors sooner other wise i'd have been in some deep shit. ","erkek arkadaşım ve ben bir yıldır çıkıyoruz, çok tatlı ve düşünceli ama son zamanlarda bana oral seks yapmamı istediğini fark ettim, onu nasıl reddedeceğimi bilmiyorum, daha önce hiç böyle bir şey sormamıştı ama şimdi çok sık olmaya başladı, dün bana sordu ve ben yorgun olduğumu söyledim ama ondan sonra defalarca sordu

sanki hayır cevabını kabul edemiyormuş gibi hissediyorum, bana kendini zorlamadı ya da başka bir şey yapmadı ama ne zaman hayır desem ağzından çıkan şeylerin yarısı bununla ilgili ve sanırım bunu anlamıyor, ben hala kendimi anlamaya çalışıyorum ve böyle devam ederse artık onunla birlikte olamayacağımı hissediyorum, o benim ilk erkek arkadaşımdı ve ilişkimizi bunun yüzünden mahvetmek istemiyorum

eğer kabul edersem sormaya devam edeceğinden korkuyorum ve ilişkimizin benim böyle şeyler yapmadığımı bilmesi etrafında dönmesini istemiyorum, en başta seks yapana kadar beklemek istediğimi açıkça belirttim, eminim ki net sınırlar koydum, ne yapmalıyım

düzenle bazı yorumları okuduktan sonra onu aradım ve ona kendimi rahatsız hissettiğim ve sormayı bırakması gerektiği hakkında konuştum, kabul etti ve evet dedi, özür de diledi. Bazı yorumlarda eğer onun için bu kadar önemliyse gitmem gerektiğini söylediler, bunun işe yarayacağını sanmıyorum, bu yüzden onu gerçek hayatta gördüğüm anda ona telefonla ayrılmak istemediğimi söyleyeceğim

düzenle onunla bir konuşma yaptım ve gerçekten hararetlendi, onu gerçekten dinlemek ve hikayenin kendi bölümünü dinlemek istedim ama işler hızla kötüye gitti, yaptığı şeyde gerçekten yanlış bir şey olduğunu düşünmüyor ve ciddi olmadığı için konuşmamıza gerek olmadığını düşünüyor, koyduğum net bir sınırı ihlal ettiğini ve buna saygı duyamayacağımı açıkladım, saygısız olmaya başladığı anda onunla ayrıldım ama çok hızlı bir ayrılıktı, sen değilsin, ben türü bir ayrılıktı, bunu duyduğumda çıldırdı ve bana her türlü ismi taktı, gerçek yüzünü daha erken gösterdiği için gerçekten mutluyum, aksi takdirde derin bir boka bulaşmış olurdum"
"For context, my cousin (fake name: Ben) is overly religious and thinks we are as well, he is a controlling bastard and doesn’t realise that he crosses lines despite the fact we tell him. Ben ruins almost every important event in our family’s lives, he made a huge scene at my brothers wedding because he was gay and he is apparently a ‘disgrace to God’ and that he would go to hell. Back to the story, Ben was actually being tolerable at my sister’s gender reveal party because apparently there was ‘nothing wrong’, we left him alone because we didn’t want to set him off. My sister popped the balloon at the time she planned and the confetti was pink, she was having a girl! We were congratulating her when Ben loudly announced ‘when are we gonna sell her off to a rich man like tradition?’. Everyone stopped and stared at him. My sister, bless her, reacted calmly and asked why on earth he thought they were doing that, to which he stated ‘she is a girl, girls are their father’s property to be sold off to their future husband’. I won’t go into detail but my uncle went off on him and took him home.
I haven’t contacted him but I got told by my sister that he got kicked out and everyone cut contact

"Hi all, sorry if this is long and choppy its my first time writing on Reddit. So my 20F sister 16F is with a 20 year old man. My sister is mature for her age, I will give her that, but I feel so weird knowing that my baby sister is dating someone who is at a completely different stage in life. I'm 99% sure he is using her--he refuses to officially ask her out, he refuses to meet our family, the only thing they do is go out to state parks for ""dates"" where they just hook up. My sister lost her virginity to this guy and if he leaves her she is going to be crushed, I don't want to see her hurt. If i'm in the wrong please tell me--I tend to be overprotective as we don't have a stable parental figure. How should I handle this situation?

"My fiance had friends come into town this weekend. They went to the pet store to buy some dog stuff to go to the beach. His friend took took my Mina out while my fiance was paying… he admitted that he didn’t grip the leash because he thought our dog was good off leash. (He’s never met our dog, this is the first time he was in town.) She is nervous around people she doesn’t know and I’m assuming that she tried to get away from him to find my fiance. Naturally, he tried to run after her but she kept running because she’s fearful around people not in our immediate family. She ended up trying to cross a busy road in the process and getting hit by a car going 45+ mph. My fiance came out of the store but it was too late - he attempted to take her to the hospital but sadly she passed on the way there. I’m currently out of the country and I feel terrible. I can’t help but feel so much anger towards his friend. My heart hurts so much and I haven’t been able to stop crying. All I think about is my dog. She was everything to us. His friend apologized but I still feel so much anger towards him. How do you handle this? I don’t even want to speak to him anymore. He gets to return back to his home to his dog and I’m flying home to some ashes. This feels surreal.

This went on for a while and they were eventually pushed out.

We are now two CEOs later and that is long past, like 2012.

I told my boss that while looking for what she asked me to look for I found an old digital camera and I am going to keep it.

So I recently started an OF account to try and make some extra money and it hasn't really helped much at all yet.

They type the same and they sent me a dickpic (they paid me to see it) and I swear in the background its the same blanket that he has in our home.. I'm almost positive its him. What should I do? Do I just block him and ignore it? Or do I just stop answering the messages from the account.

"Ever since I was a child, I have only been allowed to shower or wash my hair a maximum of twice a week. 

Just to be clear, it is by no means a financial problem for my parents, so it isn’t about not being able to afford or struggling to pay the water bill. Also, I come from an Italian background, &amp; my parents would never allow me to pay rent or bills even if I was willing to, as that is not part of our culture for children to pay to live in their family home like tenants, it is a very foreign concept &amp; they would be offended by me even offering to (particularly for daughters). Also, I am a full-time Law student &amp; do most of the housework, like cooking almost everyday, cleaning, laundry etc. Not to mention I have practically played the role of a second mother for my younger sister ever since she was born, as I am the eldest child. 

I am 21 now, &amp; a woman, so when I am on my period, I truly find it just that much more difficult to go without showering for several days at a time. I have tried explaining this to them &amp; asking them for reasons as to why a quick daily shower is so taboo &amp; like a crime in this house- I feel guilty taking one &amp; feel like I need to let them know in advanced (when I was younger, my mum used to regularly turn the shower switch off whilst I was showering if I went “too frequently” or at a time during the day she did not approve of). My dad’s explanation is that it is a waste of energy, electricity, water &amp; money. He thinks it only makes sense for people such as athletes or heavy duty workers to shower often. I tell him it is basic personal hygiene, but he doesn’t want to understand &amp; is just stingy about it. 

Where I live, it isn’t too hot, but it is rather humid &amp; during the summer, it does become unbearable. I also have relatively long, fine hair that becomes visibly greasy overnight (despite double shampooing, blow-drying &amp; following all the tips/tricks for my hair type). I am sure people with thin, naturally oily scalps can understand the pain. 

Any advice on what to do or anybody who is/has been in this situation, please let me know, thank you!

"Me f(18) and her f(19) have been best friends for 4 years now. Recently for the last few months she has been constantly getting mad at the fact that I won’t have sex with her (she refers to herself as Bisexual). I have told her many times that I don’t feel that way towards her since I’m Straight and it has nothing to do with her personally and as well as I just got out of a relationship where I was cheated on for months before finding out. So this has made me extremely uncomfortable, especially since she has told me many times that she was willing to cheat on her boyfriend with me. 

Recently they broke up and now she thinks that them not being together is an excuse for her to consistently bother me about not having sex with her.

"My girlfriend (17FM) is living at home with her single father. Her father has manic depression, and has kicked out my girlfriend 5 or 6 times since she was 15. Most recently was just over march break, where he pushed her to the floor and smashed her entire bedroom apart.

 She moved back after one weekend, where he apologized and promised to fix all the things he broke. It's been good since she came back, up until Monday. I was at her house, and her dad was disciplining her dog in a very wrong way for breaking a vase (throwing him into a cage, and smashing the side of it with his hand to scare the dog) while he was on the phone with his girlfriend. My girlfriend said that what he did was wrong, in which he hung up on his girlfriend and lost it on her while I was at her house. He has this huge thing where any type of questioning what he's doing, or having a different opinion than him is disrespect. And then he kicked me out of the house at 10pm when I didn't say anything and was just listening to them argue silently, waiting until he would stop.

 The next morning, he sent her 7 or 8 paragraphs talking about how she constantly disrespects him (untrue, he is just impossible to talk to, so he takes everything as disrespect) and how on her birthday, she will be ""evicted"" from his house. He also said she needs to find something to do with her 1 year old puppy when she is kicked out. He said that he would take the door off of the hinges of her bedroom if she closes it, and that if he sees her naked while she's changing, its ""her fault"". He has also been making her pay 100$ to live there since she was 15, and she does every chore in the house.

 Her grandparents told her that she deserved it, and she isn't allowed to live there once she gets kicked out in June. She has nobody that she can live with, and she doesn't have any money saved up (besides 500$ from a tax return) because she has to give her dad half of her paycheck every week and she also pays for everything to do with the dog.

She is supposed to go to college in september, and she was relying on her dad and grandparents to help her with buying a car, so she can get there and back from school. So now, she has to apply for residency at her college which is an hour away from where I live, and also give her dog away. 

She could technically come to my house, but it is an absolute last resort because my house is overcrowded, and my parents have already helped someone by letting them live here before (which didn't end well) and also my family is toxic. 

I honestly have no idea what she can do, and I need ALOT of advice 😭 please give me any opinions you have, I don't want her to miss going college or to end up on the street. I'm incredibly stressed out, as I'm genuinely very scared for her.

Edit 1: I messed up how much she pays. It's 100$ a week. Not a month. So she pays 400$ a month for her bedroom (and she has been since she was 15) and also pays for all of her dogs necessities. As a part time worker, she only makes 180 to 200$ a week at the place she works. So she actually ends up in debt to her dad alot. I don't even know why she's paying rent, it's apart of being a parent to give their child a safe place to live without having to pay for it. Especially when he gets child tax benefit for her already.

Edit 2: sorry guys, when first making these posts sometimes I forget certain key details. The large issue I'm facing is that I've absolutely wanted to call the police, contact CAS, and do all of the things to get her father in trouble that you guys are suggesting. The issue is that back when my girlfriends parents split, she had to deal with CAS from her mom. She said it was a very bad experience, and the CAS workers sucked. So she is doesn't see a point in contacting them because she thinks it's just gonna end up with her being put into a woman's shelter.","kız arkadaşım fm bekar babasıyla birlikte evde yaşıyor babası manik depresif ve kız arkadaşımı evden kovdu en son mart tatilinden yeni çıkmıştı babası onu yere itip tüm yatak odasını darmadağın etmişti

bir hafta sonundan sonra geri taşındı özür diledi ve kırdığı her şeyi tamir edeceğine söz verdi pazartesi gününe kadar geri döndükten sonra her şey yolundaydı ta ki pazartesi gününe kadar ben onun evindeydim ve babası köpeğini vazo kırdığı için çok yanlış bir şekilde terbiye ediyordu onu bir kafese atıp kız arkadaşıyla telefonda konuşurken köpeği korkutmak için eliyle kafesin yan tarafını kırıyordu kız arkadaşım yaptığının yanlış olduğunu söyledi ve kız arkadaşının yüzüne telefonu kapattı ve ben onun evindeyken ona çıldırdı bu çok büyük bir şeydi yaptığı şeyi sorgulamak veya ondan farklı bir fikre sahip olmak saygısızlıktı ve sonra akşam üzeri hiçbir şey söylemediğimde beni evden kovdu ve sessizce tartışmalarını dinliyordum o durana kadar bekledim

ertesi sabah ona nasıl olduğunu anlatan paragraflar gönderdi sürekli ona saygısızlık ediyor, doğru değil, onunla konuşmak imkansız, bu yüzden her şeyi saygısızlık olarak algılıyor ve doğum gününde evinden atılacağını söylüyor, ayrıca evden atıldığında bir yaşındaki köpeğiyle ilgilenecek bir şey bulması gerektiğini söyledi, kapıyı kapatırsa yatak odasının menteşelerinden kapıyı çıkaracağını ve eğer onu giyinirken çıplak görürse bunun onun hatası olduğunu söyledi, ayrıca o zamandan beri orada yaşaması için ona para ödetiyor ve evdeki her işi yapıyor

büyükanne ve büyükbabası ona bunu hak ettiğini ve haziranda evden atıldığında orada yaşamasına izin verilmediğini söyledi, birlikte yaşayabileceği kimsesi yok ve vergi iadesi dışında biriktirdiği parası yok çünkü her hafta maaşının yarısını babasına vermek zorunda ve ayrıca köpekle ilgili her şeyi ödüyor

eylülde üniversiteye gitmesi gerekiyordu ve araba satın almak için babasına ve büyükanne ve büyükbabasına güveniyordu, böylece okula gidip gelebiliyordu, bu yüzden şimdi başvuruda bulunması gerekiyor ikametgahı yaşadığım yerden bir saat uzaklıkta olan üniversitesinde ve ayrıca köpeğini de vermek

teknik olarak evime gelebilir ama bu kesinlikle son çare çünkü evim aşırı kalabalık ve ailem daha önce burada yaşamalarına izin vererek birine yardım etti ve bu iyi sonuçlanmadı ve ayrıca ailem toksik

dürüst olmak gerekirse ne yapabileceği hakkında hiçbir fikrim yok ve çok fazla tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var lütfen bana herhangi bir fikriniz varsa söyleyin üniversiteye gitmesini veya sokakta kalmasını istemiyorum inanılmaz derecede stresliyim çünkü gerçekten onun için çok korkuyorum

düzenle ne kadar ödediğini karıştırdım bir ay değil bir hafta bu yüzden yatak odası için bir ay ödüyor ve o zamandan beri böyle ve ayrıca yarı zamanlı bir çalışan olarak köpeğinin tüm ihtiyaçlarını da ödüyor çalıştığı yerde sadece bir hafta kazanıyor bu yüzden aslında babasına çok borçlu oluyor neden kira ödediğini bile bilmiyorum bu bir ebeveyn olmanın bir parçası çocuğuna güvenli bir yaşam alanı sağlamak için ödeme yapmak zorunda kalmadan özellikle de zaten çocuk vergi yardımı aldığında

düzenle üzgünüm çocuklar ilk başta Bu paylaşımlarda bazen bazı önemli detayları unutuyorum. Karşılaştığım en büyük sorun şu ki kesinlikle polisi aramak, Cas ile iletişime geçmek ve sizin öne sürdüğünüz babasını başını belaya sokacak her şeyi yapmak istiyordum. Sorun şu ki kız arkadaşımın anne ve babası ayrıldığında, annesinin Cas ile uğraşması gerekti. Bunun çok kötü bir deneyim olduğunu ve Cas çalışanlarının berbat olduğunu söyledi. Bu yüzden onlarla iletişime geçmenin bir anlamı olmadığını düşünüyor çünkü bunun onu bir kadın sığınma evine yerleştirmekle sonuçlanacağını düşünüyor."
"My (24F) father (61M) has severe alzheimer's. He has had it for 6 years, since he was 55 years old. Now, he can't walk, stand, talk, eat, drink, barely move anymore... in a few hours we will allow him to be sedated so that he can fall asleep and die without pain.

"I wish I was lying but it happened

I immediately knew that I was suddenly invited to a GC that has people that I had trouble with almost 3 years ago but I tried to just chat along despite that I hated them. They were spamming porn and gore as well as self harm videos like what I remembered. I don’t understand why the hell haven’t I left sooner but I am a dumbass. 

I made a face reveal as a photo bomb but some weirdo screenshotted and set it as a pfp. I didn’t know if some guy who spams slurs and porn having my face on his pfp would be funny or disturbing. Though I was infuriated and kept fighting with him about it ordering him to remove my face from his pfp. He refused telling me “then what are you gonna do about it?” And told me that he won’t remove it until I show him my tits. 

I left the GC due to how flooded with porn was it as well as my past with some of the members. A few hours later, he asked me whyI left and I did the grave mistake of reacting and cussing him and the rest of the people in that GC and showing off my scorn for them. Then he sent me my picture that I sent but edited to look like I am in a bikini. I told him to remove that and he deleted it and came back hours later with an edited fully naked picture. However the other one was badly edited from what it looks like.

I told him that he can get into legal trouble and he said that he’s a minor so I’d look like the one who sent him nudes and that no one would believe me. 

I just don’t want them to be sent around. Even with bad editing that I think people believe nearly anything. I’d end my life if my parents see them even if they believed me. 

I blocked him after realizing that my reactions were causing him to do more and more but I fear that he’d take it a step further. Please how can I deal with this? I’m terrorized","keşke yalan söylüyor olsaydım ama oldu

birdenbire yıllar önce sorun yaşadığım insanların olduğu bir gc'ye davet edildiğimi anladım ama onlardan nefret etmeme rağmen sohbet etmeye çalıştım, porno ve kanlı videolar ve hatırladığım kadarıyla kendime zarar verme videoları spam'liyorlardı, neden daha önce ayrılmadığımı anlamıyorum ama aptalın tekiyim

fotoğraf bombası olarak bir yüz ifşası yaptım ama bir ucube ekran görüntüsü aldı ve pfp olarak ayarladı, küfür ve porno spam'leyen bir adamın pfp'sinde yüzümün olmasının komik mi yoksa rahatsız edici mi olacağını bilmiyordum ama öfkelenmiştim ve onunla bu konuda kavga etmeye devam ettim, yüzümü pfp'sinden kaldırmasını emrettim, bana o zaman ne yapacaksın diye söylemeyi reddetti ve bana göğüslerimi gösterene kadar kaldırmayacağını söyledi

gc'den ayrıldım çünkü çok fazla porno vardı ve üyelerden bazılarıyla geçmişim vardı, birkaç saat sonra bana neden ayrıldığımı sordu ve tepki verme gibi büyük bir hata yaptım ve ona ve o gc'deki diğer insanlara küfür edip onlara olan küçümsememi gösterdim sonra bana gönderdiğim ama bikiniliymişim gibi görünmesi için düzenlediğim resmimi gönderdi, onu kaldırmasını söyledim ve sildi ve saatler sonra tamamen çıplak bir resimle geri geldi ancak diğerinin göründüğünden kötü bir şekilde düzenlenmiş olduğunu söyledi

ona yasal sorun yaşayabileceğini söyledim ve reşit olmadığını ve bu yüzden ona çıplak fotoğraf gönderen kişi gibi görüneceğimi ve kimsenin bana inanmayacağını söyledi

sadece kötü düzenlemeyle bile etrafa gönderilmelerini istemiyorum, insanların neredeyse her şeye inandığını düşünüyorum, ailem onları görürse hayatıma son veririm, bana inansalar bile

"I’ve (23m) been seeing this girl as a casual hookup every week or so for a while. After this Super Bowl, we started consistently hanging out, FaceTiming, etc numerous times a week.

This Saturday I met all of her friends and she said that they all liked me. 

She wanted to leave the bar early to go back to my house, and after hooking up she said “are you like my boyfriend?” I said that we should talk about it in the morning when we’re both sober.

The next morning I asked if she still felt the same way and she said she did. We had breakfast and hung out the whole day together.

I drop over off Monday morning, kiss her goodbye and all that, and everything’s good.

Out of the blue, she sends me a text saying that it was moving too fast and she doesn’t feel like she can be the girlfriend I deserve because she’s so busy.

What are the reasons you think she did this? What should I do? I need serious advice I really like this girl. For her to ask me to be her

"Hey guys. So I (19F) have a friend (21M) who has been really struggling in the romantic department.

Thing is, I know why he's not getting any dates. For starters; he needs to take better care of himself. He's overweight, and dresses poorly.

Secondly, he comes on too strong too fast. Hopeless romantic type deal, he catches feelings fast and sees things with rose coloured glasses.

The last reason would probably be he's too horny and needs to chill out. Like he needs to get a grip, he concentrates too much on a lack of sex when it comes to lonliness and not literally anything else.

Thing is though, i have no idea how to tell him this without breaking his self esteem. He already has low self esteem and not amazing mental health, I'm worried about what this could do for him.

He also just doesn't seem to understand how weight loss works. Like, he goes to the gym, which is good, buts its really more about being in a caloric deficit, which he doesn't seem to be doing from my knowledge. Instead he'l have a food cleanse or some other buzz feed weightloss topic then wonder why he hasnt gotten immediate results.

Any advice?

Edit: thanks for all the comments guys! I'm going through them all slowly. I'm gonna find a way to tell him but I'm gonna try to bring it up more naturally.

Have a great day/night y'all :)","hey millet, romantik bölümde gerçekten mücadele eden bir arkadaşım var

ikincisi, çok hızlı ve çok güçlü geliyor, umutsuz romantik tip, duyguları hemen yakalıyor ve her şeye pembe gözlüklerle bakıyor

son sebep muhtemelen çok azgın olması ve sakinleşmesi gerektiği, sanki kendine hakim olması gerekiyormuş gibi, yalnızlık söz konusu olduğunda seks eksikliğine çok fazla odaklanıyor ve kelimenin tam anlamıyla başka hiçbir şeye değil

mesele şu ki, ona bunu özgüvenini kırmadan nasıl söyleyeceğimi bilmiyorum, zaten düşük özgüveni var ve harika bir ruh sağlığı yok, bunun ona ne yapabileceği konusunda endişeliyim

ayrıca kilo vermenin nasıl işlediğini anlamıyor gibi görünüyor, spor salonuna gidiyor, bu iyi ama aslında daha çok kalori açığıyla ilgili, ki bildiğim kadarıyla bunu yapmıyor gibi görünüyor, bunun yerine bir gıda temizliği veya başka bir buzz feed kilo verme konusu var ve neden hemen bir şey alamadığını merak ediyor sonuçlar

"My 19-year-old daughter has this habit of talking to herself that seems to be getting more intense. She’s always talked to herself a bit since she was young, but recently, in the last few months, it's escalated. Her room is at the end of the hall, and I often hear her having what sounds like animated conversations with herself, almost like she’s chatting with someone else.

She’s a bit of an introvert and spends most of her time drawing or reading about fantasy worlds. Growing up, she had a few friends but preferred to keep to herself. She has struggled with social anxiety and has mentioned feeling out of place, and I wonder if there’s something deeper going on. Her father and I separated when she was little, and she just lost her favorite aunt last year, which has been hard on her.

I’m wondering if I should encourage her to see someone about it, maybe get some grief counseling, or if this is just her way of processing everything. Has anyone else experienced this with their teen?

"My 24 years old daughter came foward to me saying her now 36 years old brother abused her all her childhood. I'm a single father, my wife passed away when my daughter was three and i wasn't always at home as i balanced two jobs to make ends and provide a life for my children. I couldn't afford a babysitter so i asked my son to watch over his sister when i wasn't home. 

She sit me down and then accused him of horrendous things, such as : helding her head under wtaer when she was younger and needed help to bath, burning her with his lighter, tying her up when he wanted ""peace"", beating her, biting her. She also talked about molestation and ""anal violention"". 

Now, the thing is, she has scars on her body that could be because of it, but she is also not mentally well and has self harm before, attemptend to end her life and spend days in a psych ward against her will.

Also, while i wasn't there 24hours a day, i also doubt i could have missed such injuries for 15 years. For exemple, when she broke her wrist at eight she cleary said it was from falling from the tree, when she busted her eyebrow, clearly said it was from falling in the bathroom.

I don't know what to do. She told me those things then just left saying we'll talk about it later. My son has a familly and a job. He can't lose it because his sister COULD BE lying. BUT, even if it's true what am i suppose to do with it ? I can't just ask him that.","yaşındaki kızım bana gelip, şimdiki yaşındaki erkek kardeşinin çocukluğu boyunca ona kötü davrandığını söyledi. Ben bekar bir babayım. Eşim kızım üç yaşındayken vefat etti ve ben her zaman evde değildim çünkü geçinmek ve çocuklarıma bir hayat sağlamak için iki işte birden çalışıyordum. Bir bebek bakıcısı tutacak param yoktu, bu yüzden oğlumdan evde olmadığımda kız kardeşine bakmasını istedim.

Beni oturttu ve sonra onu korkunç şeylerle suçladı, örneğin daha küçükken ve banyo yapmak için yardıma ihtiyacı olduğunda başını suyun altında tutmak, barışmak istediğinde onu çakmağıyla yakmak, onu dövmek, ısırmak gibi. Ayrıca taciz ve anal şiddetten bahsetti.

Şimdi mesele şu ki vücudunda bunun yüzünden olabilecek yara izleri var ama aynı zamanda akıl sağlığı yerinde değil ve hayatına son vermeden önce kendine zarar veriyor ve isteği dışında bir psikiyatri koğuşunda günler geçiriyor.

Ayrıca ben orada olmadığım saatler boyunca bu tür yaralanmaları yıllarca fark etmemiş olabileceğimden de şüpheliyim, örneğin sekiz yaşındayken bileğini kırdığında, ağaçtan düştüğünde açıkça bunun olduğunu söyledi. kaşını patlattı, bunun banyoda düşmekten kaynaklandığını açıkça söyledi

ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, bana bunları söyledi ve sonra sadece ""sonra konuşuruz"" diyerek gitti, oğlumun bir ailesi ve işi var, onu kaybedemez çünkü kız kardeşi yalan söylüyor olabilir ama doğru olsa bile bununla ne yapmam gerekiyor, ona bunu soramam"
"So my (22f) boyfriend (29m) was supposed to be going on a road trip this weekend. The plan was that he was going to leave with his dad today (friday) and come back on sunday night. I couldn’t go, because someone needed to stay back and watch his dads elderly dog. The purpose of the trip is family related, but it’s in a big city with a lot of other things to do. We live 4 hours away and rarely go. I was sad that I had to stay back but i’d accepted it.

Yesterday I got a call from my brother, that him, my mom, and two sisters were gonna be in that same city on Saturday and invited me to come hang out with them. I haven’t seen my sisters in over a year and obviously I really wanted to go. HOWEVER, I said I wouldn’t go &amp; would still stay and watch the dog. I cried about it, but i cry easily and was sad that i was missing an opportunity to see my family.

Yesterday we went to his dads place so he could tell me the dogs routine and everything. I guess he noticed I looked like i’d been crying and he asked my bf when they were alone if we were fighting. My bf told him the situation and it’s all fucked from there. 

All of the sudden the plans changed and they were gonna take the dog, and i could come too to see my family. Taking the dog does make it harder for everyone and my bf seemed pissed at this turn of events. We were supposed to leave today but this morning we just didn’t. I told him i’d still stay to watch the dog, but then his dad said that no, the dog is staying with him. 

My bf went back to sleep and he woke up pissed as hell, ignoring me and slamming stuff around. I asked why he was pissed and he ignored me. I asked if he was ignoring me now and he said he has nothing to say to me. That i fucked up his trip and all i had to do was watch the dog. 

Him and his dad are leaving tomorrow morning now, with the dog, and i’m staying here. I have no idea how everything got so fucked up, at no point did i say i wouldn’t watch the dog. i was merely sad at the missed opportunity and had the audacity to show my emotions. He’s still pissed and left the apartment.

I wasn’t involved in any planning, i barely knew what the hell was going on. I don’t know what to do now. I feel like it’s unfair that he’s putting all the blame on me. I have nobody to talk to and i’m just sitting here alone and i feel so isolated and sad. Maybe this is just a rant, sorry it’s so long ","erkek arkadaşım m bu hafta sonu bir yolculuğa çıkacaktı plan bugün cuma günü babasıyla birlikte yola çıkıp pazar gecesi geri dönecekti ben gidemedim çünkü birinin geride kalıp babasının yaşlı köpeğine bakması gerekiyordu yolculuğun amacı ailevi ama yapılacak çok şey olan büyük bir şehirde saatlerce uzakta yaşıyoruz ve nadiren gidiyoruz geride kalmak zorunda olduğum için üzgündüm ama kabul ettim

dün kardeşimden bir telefon aldım cumartesi günü annem ve iki kız kardeşimin aynı şehirde olacağını ve beni onlarla takılmaya davet ettiğini söyledi kız kardeşlerimi bir yıldan uzun süredir görmedim ve açıkçası gitmek istiyordum ama gitmeyeceğimi ve yine de kalıp köpeği izleyeceğimi söyledim bunun için ağladım ama kolay ağlarım ve ailemi görme fırsatını kaçırdığım için üzgündüm

dün babasının evine gittik böylece bana köpeklerin rutinini ve her şeyi anlatabilirdi sanırım fark etti ağlıyormuşum gibi görünüyordum ve erkek arkadaşıma yalnızken kavga edip etmediğimizi sordu erkek arkadaşım söyledi ona durumu anlattım ve her şey oradan itibaren berbat oldu

birdenbire planlar değişti ve köpeği alacaklardı ve ben de ailemi görmeye gelebilirdim köpeği almak herkes için daha zor hale getiriyor ve erkek arkadaşım bu olaylardan dolayı sinirli görünüyordu bugün ayrılmamız gerekiyordu ama bu sabah ayrılmadık ona köpeği izlemek için kalacağımı söyledim ama sonra babası hayır köpeğin onunla kalacağını söyledi

erkek arkadaşım tekrar uykuya daldı ve cehennem gibi sinirli bir şekilde uyandı beni görmezden geldi ve etrafa eşyalar fırlattı neden sinirli olduğunu sordum ve beni görmezden geldi şimdi beni görmezden mi geliyor diye sordum ve bana söyleyecek hiçbir şeyi olmadığını söyledi gezisini mahvettim ve yapmam gereken tek şey köpeği izlemekti

o ve babası yarın sabah köpekle birlikte gidiyorlar ve ben burada kalıyorum her şeyin nasıl bu kadar berbat hale geldiği hakkında hiçbir fikrim yok hiçbir noktada köpeğe bakmayacağımı söylemedim sadece kaçırdığım fırsat için üzgündüm ve duygularımı gösterme cüretini gösterdim hala sinirli ve gitti daire

hiçbir planlamaya dahil olmadım, neler olup bittiğini zar zor biliyordum, şimdi ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, tüm suçu bana yüklemesinin adil olmadığını hissediyorum, konuşacak kimsem yok ve burada tek başıma oturuyorum ve kendimi çok yalnız ve üzgün hissediyorum, belki bu sadece bir söylenme, üzgünüm, çok uzun"
"I’m 20 (F). I met a guy in college who’s 30. We got along pretty well. We did have a complicated relationship. It had its ups and downs. But I deeply care for him. Or I did. Until last night. I found out he’s a sex offender, and that he sexually assaulted a 15 year old girl about 10 years ago. He told me in the beginning when we met that he was a felon and that he served time for 5 years. I tried asking him why he was convicted but he always avoided by telling me he didn’t wanna talk about it or he would tell me later. I’m not gonna lie I did have feelings for him. But now I don’t know what to do. Should I talk to him about this or completely cut off ties with him. I’m very hurt and I feel very stupid for feeling this way. I thought he was a good man because he sometimes treated me well. I don’t know.
I can’t avoid him even though the semester has ended. We go to the same campus and run into each from time to time at cafes. I’m not in a relationship with this guy. I never was. When I look back at the times when I hung out alone with him, I feel terrified. I am now scared of him. I was reading our texts, he was flirtatious all the time. That used to make me feel good about myself. But now that I read these texts again, all I can feel is fear and creeped out. I promise this isn’t a troll post.

Fridays after work I (f29) meet with a group of my friends for dinner. I showed my mom a group photo we took this past weekend and she asked if I realized I was a lot larger than the others. I told her I did and she asked why I continue going out to eat every Friday knowing I’m so unhealthy. She made comments about how I didn’t seem to belong with the group and stuck out like a sore thumb. I stopped responding to her after this and was going to let it go. Today I mentioned the convo to a friend and she seemed to agree with my mom and implied I’m only invited out as a pity invite. I feel really ashamed and embarrassed over this whole situation and now I feel like I don’t have any real friends. Should I stop going out on Fridays with them? Should I ask another friend if the group feels the same?,Cuma günleri işten sonra bir grup arkadaşımla akşam yemeği için buluşurum. Anneme geçen hafta sonu çekilmiş bir grup fotoğrafını gösteririm ve diğerlerinden çok daha iri olduğumu fark edip etmediğimi sorar. Fark ettiğimi söylerim. O da neden her cuma dışarı yemeğe çıkmaya devam ettiğimi sorar. Bu kadar sağlıksız olmama rağmen gruba ait olmadığım ve bir başparmak gibi sırıttığım hakkında yorumlar yapar. Bundan sonra ona cevap vermeyi bıraktım ve bugün konuyu kapatacaktım. Konuşmayı bir arkadaşıma anlattım ve annemle aynı fikirde gibi göründü ve sadece acınacak bir davet olarak davet edildiğimi ima etti. Bu durumdan dolayı gerçekten utanıyorum ve mahcup hissediyorum. Şimdi hiç gerçek arkadaşım yokmuş gibi hissediyorum. Cuma günleri dışarı çıkmayı bırakmalı mıyım? Başka bir arkadaşıma sormalı mıyım? Grup da aynı şeyi hissediyor mu?

"I live next to a guy who’s really friendly, but he has this habit of “borrowing” tools and not giving them back unless I ask. At first, I didn’t mind, but now it’s getting annoying. He’s borrowed everything from my drill to my ladder, and each time I end up having to ask for it back days or even weeks later. Recently, I was looking for a wrench set I’d lent him, and he casually told me he’d “loaned it to his brother” without even asking if that was okay.

I’m considering setting a hard boundary here. I even had a bit of extra money come in from a recent win on Stake, and I’ve been thinking of getting a small lockbox for my garage tools so I don’t have to keep chasing down my own stuff. But I don’t want to damage our neighborly relationship, since we live close and see each other all the time.

What’s a polite but firm way to let him know that I’m not comfortable with this “borrowing” anymore? Has anyone else had to put their foot down with a friendly but overreaching neighbor?","gerçekten arkadaş canlısı bir adamın yanında yaşıyorum ama aletleri ödünç alıp ben istemediğim sürece geri vermeme alışkanlığı var ilk başta aldırış etmedim ama artık can sıkıcı olmaya başladı matkabımdan merdivenime kadar her şeyi ödünç aldı ve her seferinde günler hatta haftalar sonra geri istemek zorunda kalıyorum yakın zamanda ona ödünç verdiğim bir anahtar takımı arıyordum ve bana sormadan kardeşine ödünç verdiğini söyledi, sorun olur mu?

"
I (22F) have been with my bf (31M) for 3.5 years, and we are supposed to get married in about 4 weeks, but I think that I need to break up with him. And he messaged me last night that he thought we should hold off on getting married because he’s mad at me. 

For context, he was mad that I wouldn’t get him a skin for his game because I wouldn’t have money for gas to get to work. We have lived together for almost the entire length of our relationship and it has never been a very smooth relationship. My bf has only had a job once in the years we’ve been together, and it was only for about a week. He is a diabetic and does have issues from it that have gotten worse over the past year, but even before that he refused to get a job and it was always because he either ‘didn’t feel good enough’ or he just didn’t want to. 

I became financially responsible for him shortly after we got into our relationship. Everything he needed or wanted, I got for him even if that meant that I couldn’t get something for myself, and it has remained that way. We lived with a family member of his for about 1.5-2 years until a I got a little further away and we finally moved. Well I ended up always buying stuff for him that it was making it hard for me to afford our rent. But he didn’t care and anytime I would refuse to buy him something, he would just get made and have an attitude or through what was basically a tantrum until I finally caved. That ended up making me fall behind and having to leave that apartment before we got evicted. 

Somehow all of has become my fault. My fault for not having any money, my fault for having to right back to his family members house, my fault for being sad and angry. Literally every time I get paid I spend 95% of my money on him and am left with nothing. Every time he says he’s going to stop asking for things, but he never does. I’m left with nothing savings, literally nothing.  He’s also very mean to me. 

He is constantly saying things like I’m stupid and dumb, and that I couldn’t stand to loose some weight. Whenever I get upset about it, he just says that I can’t take a joke and that I’m boring/no fun. If I joke back with him like that, then he gets mad at me and says I’m a bad person. He refuses to show any form of physical affection like hand holding, kissing, or hugging. I’ve tried talking to him about my mental health but he doesn’t care at all. 

All of this and for some reason, I still feel like I should love him. I feel so stuck in this relationship. I’ve never lived alone before and can’t currently afford a place. I have thought about moving into a room someone is renting out closer to where I work. I have literally started fantasizing about being single and finally being in control of my life and being happy. 

What’s the best way to leave? Should I just stay since we’ve already been together for 3.5 years?","erkek arkadaşımla yıllardır birlikteyiz ve yaklaşık birkaç hafta içinde evlenmemiz gerekiyor ama sanırım onunla ayrılmam gerekiyor ve dün gece bana evlenmeyi ertelememiz gerektiğini çünkü bana kızgın olduğunu söyledi

ilişkimize başladıktan kısa bir süre sonra onun için maddi olarak sorumlu oldum ihtiyacı olan veya istediği her şeyi onun için aldım bu kendim için bir şey alamayacağım anlamına gelse bile ve bu şekilde devam etti yaklaşık yıllarca bir aile üyesiyle yaşadık ta ki biraz daha uzaklaşana ve biz sonunda iyi taşındım sonunda ona sürekli bir şeyler almaya başladım bu da kiramızı ödememi zorlaştırıyordu ama umursamadı ve ona bir şey almayı reddettiğimde sadece sinirleniyordu ve bir tavır takınıyordu ya da sonunda pes edene kadar temelde bir öfke nöbeti geçiriyordu bu da beni geride bıraktı ve evden çıkarılmadan önce o daireden ayrılmak zorunda kaldım

tüm bunlar ve nedense hala onu sevmem gerektiğini hissediyorum bu ilişkide sıkışmış hissediyorum daha önce hiç yalnız yaşamadım ve şu anda bir yer alamıyorum birinin kiraladığı bir odaya taşınmayı düşündüm çalıştığım yere daha yakın bir yerde bekar olmayı ve sonunda hayatımı kontrol etmeyi ve mutlu olmayı hayal etmeye başladım

"**UPDATE:** I was finally able to get in contact with my niece. Apparently, my sister hadn't paid her phone bill, so my niece's phone was turned off until a day ago. I made sure she was in a separate room and asked her about the situation. She confirmed she got the abortion done, with the boyfriend accompanying her and my sister. Once I confirmed with her, I spoke to my sister in person the next day and explained what our mother had told me and what it made me think was going on. My sister told me she understood how everything looked from my perspective with what I'd been told. I apologized for doubting and assuming the worst of her. We both then tore our mom a new asshole for causing this whole thing because she got mixed up over which weekend my niece had stayed over (Even after I previously asked mom several times whether she was absolutely sure about when my niece was at her house.)

Regardless of the outcome, I still had concerns about my niece not having food for 2 weeks and other stuff. My sister and I are going to work together to make sure there's food at home and to make her living space more enjoyable. My niece thanked me for worrying about her and said she considers me her second mom - which made me feel all warm and fuzzy. 

Thank you everyone for your advice even though it was, thankfully, not actually needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a 33 yr old female. Nearly a month ago, my sister (41F) told me that her daughter (14F) recently found out she was pregnant. After an ultrasound screening, I was told by my sister that the pregnancy is at least 10 weeks along. In our state, the cut off for an abortion is 6 weeks. My sister told me my niece didn't want to keep the pregnancy. I looked online for states that allow abortion procedures for her gestational age and gave them to my sister. She told me she was taking my niece out-of-state to a clinic in Virginia on the 20th, where they would be getting the procedure done on the 21st and be back by the 22nd.

I attempted to call my sister at various points throughout the weekend to check in on them or see if they needed money for a hotel or anything. My sister never picks up. She texts on Sunday the 22nd that they just go back and that everything was okay.

On Tuesday, I'm able to speak to my sister face-to-face where she directly confirmed that they had the procedure done and that my niece regrets it. I understand her feelings, but found the way my sister was talking about the situation very concerning. For example, she spoke of how someone who wanted a baby could've adopted it. When I pointed out that at 14, my niece's body was way too thin and underdeveloped to safely carry a pregnancy or give birth without any lasting complications, my sister abruptly said she didn't want to talk about it. I let the subject dropped to not start an argument.

That same day, I visited our parents as we all live in the same town. During the visit, my mother mentioned seeing my niece's boyfriend (the father of the pregnancy) which confused me as he had moved to Texas somewhat recently. My mother said, ""No, he was with her when she stayed over this weekend.""

I couldn't process what she was saying at first and went, ""There's no way she was here this weekend."" I thought I was going crazy, but no. My mother and father confirmed that: A.) They knew about the pregnancy the whole time even though my sister made me promise not to tell them about it, and B.) My sister and niece never left the state.

Apparently, my sister took my niece with her for an ultrasound where they said the fetus was a boy. At this point, my niece suddenly changed her mind and wants to keep the pregnancy. Mind you, this is information they're getting from my sister. First of all, I'm angry that my sister thought I was so stupid that I wouldn't notice such an obvious lie once the pregnancy got further along. That's when I realized that, throughout this entire situation, I haven't seen or heard from my niece. My mother had been regularly texting with her and said my niece was considering asking for me to take her to an out-of-state clinic, because she thought her mother was purposefully sabotaging as a way to force her to keep the pregnancy. That was before the weekend ultrasound. Nothing else since then. Radio silence.

Something to know about my sister is that she's not very mentally stable. She has BPD plus ADHD / Bipolar Disorder. Throughout my niece's life, my sister has treated her more as an extension of herself than as a real person. According to my mother, my niece stayed with them for 2 weeks because there wasn't food at their house. She's not a good parent in any sense of the word and that has sadly effected my niece and her behavior as she's become a teenager. My niece has previously had problems with drugs and alcohol, and generally has a somewhat tense relationship with her mother. With this in mind, I wouldn't put it past my sister to try and force her daughter to keep this pregnancy solely to have access to a ""do-over"" child.

I know this sounds conspiratorial and crazy. I just wish I could actually see and speak to my niece to confirm these are her wishes and that she doesn't need my help. I've tried texting and calling her - even messaged her on Tik Tok and haven't received any indication she's even seen them. I'm terrified that I've failed her when she needed me most. I know I can't get CPS involved (Hello, CPS, I need help because an abortion isn't happening), and I know my legal options are limited in the state we're in.

I feel lost on what to do. I'll take advice or even being told that I'm overthinking things or being crazy.","update i was finally able to get in contact with my niece apparently my sister hadnt paid her phone bill so my nieces phone was turned off until a day ago i made sure she was in a separate room and asked her about the situation she confirmed she got the abortion done with the boyfriend accompanying her and my sister once i confirmed with her i spoke to my sister in person the next day and explained what our mother had told me and what it made me think was going on my sister told me she understood how everything looked from my perspective with what id been told i apologized for doubting and assuming the worst of her we both then tore our mom a new asshole for causing this whole thing because she got mixed up over which weekend my niece had stayed over even after i previously asked mom several times whether she was absolutely sure about when my niece was at her house

"I (F) have been with my partner (M) for seven years. We have two young kids so sex is...challenging and we've discovered some issues in our sex life that didn't matter before when we had time and spontaneity! 
He's my first sexual partner so never given a blow job to anyone else. He says he doesn't care about technique but struggles with ""being in his head"" too much while I'm doing it and worries I'm bored/ tired/not enjoying it. The thing is, I do sometimes find that's true. I haven't found a position that's comfortable to maintain for enough time for him to orgasm so I do get tired.

"I(20m) recently started reading Agatha Christie’s ‘The Body in the Library’. At first it was an enjoyable read but now I’m struggling to follow the plot. When my gf(19) saw me putting the book down in frustration she laughed before saying I ‘must be retarded’ if I ‘can’t keep up’ with that book at our age.  


When I told her that that’s not nice, she shrugged. She said that ‘she only spoke the truth’ and that I ‘shouldn’t be so triggered by it.’ What do I tell her now? What do I say to her?","yakın zamanda agatha christie'nin kütüphanedeki ceset kitabını okumaya başladım ilk başta keyifli bir okumaydı ama şimdi olay örgüsünü takip etmekte zorlanıyorum kız arkadaşım beni hayal kırıklığı içinde kitabı bırakırken görünce güldü ve yaşımızda bu kitabı okuyamıyorsam gerizekalı olmalıyım dedi

I don't know why he turned out to be like that, I really don't but here we are. 
I don't want to make this post long because even thinking about him rn piss me off. 

This boy is fucking crazy and a menace. 
He's disrespectful to our parents and to my sister and I. He misbehaves every day and doesn't learn from his mistakes as if all he did was nothing. 

Basically he throws insults every day/every hour, he touches our private parts (for the women, not my dad obviously), threatens to rape either my sister or me, talks in a really vulgar, sexual manner (he says things a kid shouldn't be saying), doesn't want to do his homeworks and my mom has to beg for him to ever look at his lesson. He flashes his private parts to us and walks naked with no shame. He's lazy, he's annoying, he's a dumbass. 

I don't know what to do. I advised my parents to go see a psychologist to see if something isn't wrong with him but they don't want to because they fear that it will follow him everywhere in his life.","Ailemde ondan derinden rahatsız olan tek kişi ben değilim aslında hepimizi üzüyor

"I came from a very traditional Asian (40F) family, where staying a virgin before getting married is a must.

I didn't really have any problem with the rules until October of 2019 (5 years ago - then 35) when I was rush to the ER for a heart issue which lead to other medical discovery. 

While was in the ER they did all different medical tests (and based from my previous medical history they did all necessary medical test) and one of the test was the CT scans, which they found a mass in my midsection area. That lead to a request of a biopsy from my ovary.

As you already know I was a virgin, being check with medical personnel in a very ""traumatic way - spreading your legs to strangers"" for me was so degrading and embarrassing but more than that I was scared of what they are not telling me.

When the biopsy results came, I was informed I had a Stage 2 Ovarian cancer that has now metastasized. I was given two choices either to undergo chemotherapy or surgery. I choose surgery. 

I had to undergo the radical hysterectomy. By Google's definition ""Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, part of the vagina, and a wide area of ligaments and tissues around these organs. The ovaries, fallopian tubes, and nearby lymph nodes may also be removed. A radical hysterectomy is usually done through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen.""

After this life changing events I really regret avoiding to date (that time i was hoping I could do it later in life and prioritize my career first).

I've always wanted a family but after my surgery all hopes has been shattered. I tried to be positive but to be honest even my faith has sadly affected. It's been 5 years and I can't still move on completely. One day I'm okay then one day I'm back to questioning ""Why me?"" phase.

I regret staying a virgin. I regret not experiencing making love with someone. I regret not taking my health a priority and I regret delaying my love life. I regret that I will never be able to experience the feeling of losing your virginity. I have so many regrets. 

My family and friends have been understanding but I can't seem to move on. Everyday I always pray for strength especially in my faith and mental health. 

I'm 40 now, and has accepted the fact I will be single for the rest of my life. I feel like men will never be able to accept me fully because of my physical disability. Since I'm now incapable of conceiving a baby. Let alone start a family. I mean at one point I am considering of just adopting and be a single parent. Maybe my dream of having a family will suffice this longing. But I never really done anything but just mentally note taking the consequences of my actions. I don't want to raise a child and end up psychologically hurting the child because of my regrets.

I tried seeking medical help for my mental state but seems not really working.

By the way, I am now Cancer from after my surgery. I still go to my gynecologist every four months for regular check up.

So, am I being so negative in life? Don't get me wrong. I am blessed to have been given a second chance in life. But this gnawing feeling of not being the same is just eating me. Of being incapable and not good enough for someone to love.

I know there are far more helpless people whose problems are worse than mine but I don't know where to vent or to tell people in my circles or psychologist or councilor anymore. I feel I become a broken CD that no one seems to understand. 

Has anyone experience what I've been through? How do you move on in life? How do you keep your faith strong? How do you keep your self from constantly crying? How do you start living life?","çok geleneksel bir asya ailesinden geliyorum, evlenmeden önce bakire kalmak şart

yıllar önce ekim ayına kadar kurallarla ilgili gerçekten bir sorunum yoktu, sonra kalp rahatsızlığım için acile kaldırıldım ve bu da başka tıbbi bulgulara yol açtı

acildeyken tüm farklı tıbbi testleri yaptılar ve önceki tıbbi geçmişime dayanarak tüm gerekli tıbbi testleri yaptılar ve testlerden biri de karın bölgemde bir kitle buldukları bilgisayarlı tomografi taramalarıydı ve bu da yumurtalığımdan biyopsi istenmesine yol açtı

zaten bildiğiniz gibi bakireydim, çok travmatik bir şekilde tıbbi personel tarafından kontrol edilmek, bacaklarınızı yabancılara açmak benim için çok aşağılayıcı ve utanç vericiydi ama bundan daha da önemlisi bana söylemedikleri şeylerden korkuyordum

biyopsi sonuçları geldiğinde bana metastaz yapmış bir evre yumurtalık kanseri olduğum söylendi, kemoterapi veya ameliyat olmak üzere iki seçeneğim vardı, ameliyatı seçtim

google'ın tanımına göre rahim ağzının bir kısmını çıkarmak için radikal histerektomi ameliyatı olmak zorunda kaldım vajina ve bu organların etrafındaki geniş bir bağ ve doku alanı yumurtalıklar fallop tüpleri ve yakındaki lenf düğümleri de çıkarılabilir radikal histerektomi genellikle karında büyük bir kesi yapılarak yapılır

bu hayat değiştiren olaylardan sonra o zamana kadar kaçındığım için gerçekten pişmanım bunu daha sonraki hayatımda yapabileceğimi ve kariyerime öncelik verebileceğimi umuyordum

her zaman bir aile istedim ama ameliyatımdan sonra tüm umutlarım paramparça oldu pozitif olmaya çalıştım ama dürüst olmak gerekirse inancım bile üzücü bir şekilde etkilendi yıllar geçti ve hala tamamen devam edemiyorum bir gün iyiyim sonra bir gün neden ben evresini sorgulamaya geri dönüyorum

bakire kalmaktan pişmanım biriyle sevişme deneyimi yaşamadığım için pişmanım sağlığımı önceliklendirmediğim için pişmanım ve aşk hayatımı ertelediğim için pişmanım asla bekaretimi kaybetme hissini yaşayamayacağım için pişmanım çok pişmanım

ailem ve arkadaşlarım anlayışlı davrandılar ama her gün devam edemiyorum her zaman özellikle inancım ve ruh sağlığım için güç için dua ediyorum

şimdi ve hayatımın geri kalanında bekar kalacağım gerçeğini kabullendim hayat fiziksel engelliğim yüzünden erkeklerin beni asla tam olarak kabul edemeyeceğini hissediyorum çünkü artık bir bebek sahibi olamıyorum, bırakın bir aile kurmayı, yani bir noktada sadece evlat edinmeyi ve bekar bir ebeveyn olmayı düşünüyorum belki bir aile kurma hayalim bu özlemi giderir ama aslında hiçbir şey yapmadım sadece zihinsel olarak eylemlerimin sonuçlarını kabul ediyorum pişmanlıklarım yüzünden bir çocuk yetiştirmek ve çocuğu psikolojik olarak incitmek istemiyorum

zihinsel durumum için tıbbi yardım almaya çalıştım ama pek işe yaramıyor gibi görünüyor

bu arada ameliyattan sonra kanser oldum hala düzenli kontrol için her dört ayda bir jinekoloğuma gidiyorum

hayatta çok mu negatifim yanlış anlamayın hayatta bana ikinci bir şans verildiği için şanslıyım ama aynı olmamanın bu kemiren hissi beni sadece aciz olmaktan ve sevilecek biri için yeterince iyi olmamaktan yiyor

biliyorum ki sorunları benden daha kötü olan çok daha çaresiz insanlar var ama artık nerede dert yanacağımı veya çevremdeki insanlara, psikologlara veya danışmanlara anlatacağımı bilmiyorum kimsenin anlayamadığı bozuk bir cd ol

So me 20m and my partner 20f were very intimate at the beginning of our relationship and we got together because we both liked each other in school and never knew it fast forward we both got out of toxic relationships and were happy for the time being and we were intimate at least 3x a week but then she got sent to the er due to complications and found out she was allergic to condoms and was told at least 6 months to recover and we discussed agreed to get on bc and later she changed her mind about that aswell and made a joke saying “we just won’t do it anymore” and she saw that it visibly bothered me and then told me she was joking but I’m pretty sure she’s not and it’s been way past the recovery period but I don’t know what to do or how to bring it up are my feelings or frustration valid??,Yani ben ve partnerim f ilişkimizin başında çok yakındık ve bir araya geldik çünkü ikimiz de okulda birbirimizden hoşlanıyorduk ve bunu hiç bilmiyorduk. Hızlı ilerleyince ikimiz de toksik ilişkilerden çıktık ve o an için mutluyduk ve haftada en az x kez yakınlaşıyorduk ama sonra komplikasyonlar nedeniyle acile gönderildi ve prezervatiflere alerjisi olduğunu öğrendi ve iyileşmesi için en az aylar gerektiği söylendi ve bc kullanmaya karar verdik ve daha sonra bu konuda da fikrini değiştirdi ve bir daha yapmayacağımızı söyleyen bir şaka yaptı ve bunun beni açıkça rahatsız ettiğini gördü ve sonra bana şaka yaptığını söyledi ama şaka yapmadığından oldukça eminim ve iyileşme sürecini çok geçti ama ne yapacağımı veya bunu nasıl gündeme getireceğimi bilmiyorum.

"Throwaway account.

My uncle is old, body shutting down, he has cancer, one kidney, losing weight rapidly, he can no longer take care of himself. We can't keep taking care of him either. I work full time, my grandma is up there in years too, if he falls while I'm not there, who knows what could happen. I mean, even me and my mother can't pick him up, he's lost weight but he's still a big dude, not to mention he wears diapers due to uncontrollable bowel movements. His room smells awful, when he can use the bathroom, he opts for a toilet stored in his bedroom 99% of the time.

Today, he drove himself to his chemo appointment in San Francisco, and got into a wreck. He made it back home, I suppose the van wasn't TOO damaged but upon inspecting the interior, the whole front fender stored in the back of the van, there are fecal stains on the seat, the wheel, its wretched.

Upon making it home, he didn't hop in the shower, he didn't go change his diaper, he went to the kitchen and made some coffee. He sat in his bedroom, door wide open, and called the insurance company, with his unwashed body on display to anyone unfortunate enough to enter the holiday. 

The man is mentally not well, he lives day to day soaking in his own feces and urine, but believes everything is fine. My grandma knows he needs to be in a nursing home where people are trained to deal with this, where there's enough people there round the clock to help, but she simply tells me that she ""can't do that"" 

Is there anything I can do here? Is there any way we can get him put into a home? This is all getting to be too much for me or my grandma to deal with.

Edit: It's not that my grandmother doesn't want him in a home, long ago he made her promise him that she'd never stick him in one. Ultimately he's still mentally there just enough to convince nurses that he's fine. He has nurses that come in weekly for like, 3 - 5 minutes at a time. They're aware of his inability to use the restroom normally. ","atılabilir hesap

"So my (m27) SIL (f28) has never. Ever. Once known me as a woman. Ever. I've been introduced as a man, my fiance calls me his boyfriend and future HUSBAND. 

I am on T but don't ""pass"" as much as I wish. I also like cute things but typically dress very androgynous. I do have a large chest I try to bind but it hurts a LOT so often I go without around people I'm comfortable with.

My SIL is a lesbian and has been quite vocal that she finds me attractive. Often talking about how jealous she is to my fiance (her brother) how jealous she is. Her wife is in the room too I might add...

So I wonder if its because she views me as a woman because she's attracted to me....??

I'm not sure how to confront her on this. My fiance has brought it up many times to her and calls her out. I even talked to him about how weird it is.

I honestly wouldn't be as offended if she had known me pre-transition and was getting use to the new pronouns. But she never has. I've only ever been introduced as a man.

How on earth can I talk to her or do anything about this situation? Any advice welcome.

"Sorry in advance for my babbling on-

My daughters and i live in a small street next to the forest and there's lots of other children around the same age as my twin girls (just turned 6 last week). I usually sit outside of my house to keep an eye on them,  but pop back to make dinner and then call them in. Today when i popped back indoors a 9 year old boy that lives around the corner took my daughters off into the forest (he was not out when i was sat there watching them play) and kissed one of them on the lips. Her sister ran back to tell me what happened and i RAN to get her. 

May be worth adding that we've had some issues with this boy hitting, spitting, name calling and lying about my daughter and ive had to speak with his parents more than once - he can do no wrong in his mothers eyes it seems - speaking with his mother has never gone well as she gets very angry and just calls everyone else liars.  other parents have told me about their own concerns about him and their kids and said chats with her have gone much the same way.

i have had a conversation with my girls about right/wrong and safety when it comes to this boy and told them to stay away from him but evidently i cant turn my back now in fear of them running off into some sort of situation with him anyway. 

Would anyone else be really concerned about this? How should i handle it? Please send help 😅

Thank you! 


UPDATE:
Thank you for all your comments ive been humbled and also validated and come up with a plan and a few changes with your suggestions 😊

First went to speak to his parents (seems dad does exist but stared at me the whole time and didnt say a word), i wanted to be calm and respectful to try and open a decent conversation but as predicted the mother got angry and told me to ""F*** off"". So i told her if she wasnt going to set clear rules and bounadaries with him then id take it further to protect my children and off i f****d as requested. 

I sat and had a really good chat with my kids about everything, set rules, talked feelings, right/wrong etc and kept them home today for breaking the rules i had already set.

I called CPS who it seems are taking it very seriously and i have a plan to speak to the girls school safeguarding lead  ASAP. 

As i said im glad i was humbled by some of you as it'll up my game and i will not be leaving my kids out of my sight for a moment. Theyll be out when im out or in when im in. In a perfect world i could leave them on the driveway for a moment with their friends... but this is evidently not a perfect world.

eklemeye değer olabilir ki bu oğlanla ilgili bazı sorunlar yaşadık, tükürdü, isim taktı ve kızım hakkında yalan söyledi ve ailesiyle birden fazla kez konuşmak zorunda kaldım annesinin gözünde hiçbir yanlış yapamaz annesiyle konuşması hiç iyi gitmemiş gibi görünüyor çünkü çok sinirleniyor ve herkese yalancı diyor diğer ebeveynler bana onun ve çocuklarıyla ilgili kendi endişelerini anlattılar ve onunla yaptıkları sohbetlerin de aynı şekilde gittiğini söylediler

kızlarımla doğru yanlış ve güvenlik hakkında bir konuşma yaptım bu çocuğa geldi ve onlara ondan uzak durmalarını söyledi ama belli ki artık sırtımı dönemem çünkü onların onunla bir tür duruma kaçıp gitmelerinden korkuyorum

başka biri de bu konuda gerçekten endişeli mi? lütfen yardım gönderin

teşekkür ederim

güncelleme
tüm yorumlarınız için teşekkür ederim, alçakgönüllü oldum ve onaylandım ve önerilerinizle bir plan ve birkaç değişiklik yaptım

önce ailesiyle konuşmaya gittim, babası varmış gibi görünüyor ama bana sürekli baktı ve tek kelime etmedi, sakin ve saygılı olmak istedim, düzgün bir konuşma açmaya çalıştım ama tahmin ettiğim gibi anne sinirlendi ve bana siktirip gitmemi söyledi, ben de ona eğer onunla net kurallar ve sınırlar koymayacaksa çocuklarımı korumak için daha ileri gideceğimi söyledim ve istendiği gibi siktirip gittim

oturdum ve çocuklarımla her şey hakkında gerçekten iyi bir sohbet ettim, kurallar koydum, duygularımı konuştum, doğru, yanlış vb. ve bugün zaten koyduğum kuralları çiğnedikleri için onları evde tuttum

çocuk koruma görevlilerini aradım, çok ciddiye alıyorlar gibi görünüyor ve kız okulunun güvenlik sorumlusuyla en kısa sürede görüşmeyi planlıyorum

dediğim gibi, bazılarınız tarafından alçakgönüllü kılındığım için mutluyum çünkü bu benim oyunumu geliştirecek ve çocuklarımı bir an bile gözümün önünden ayırmayacağım, ben dışarıdayken onlar da dışarıda olacaklar ya da ben içerideyken onlar da içeride olacaklar, mükemmel bir dünyada onları bir anlığına arkadaşlarıyla birlikte garaj yolunda bırakabilirdim ama bu açıkça mükemmel bir dünya değil

"Okay so I (18F now) have a dude (21M now) I sent photos to in 2020 that still texts me saying he loves me and thinks about me daily- how do I end it?

  Okay so back in 2020, weird year, weird choices, I started a slight thing (nothing meaningful) with this guy from thousands of miles away after we had some good talks. Soon after he started pushing things a bit further, and at the time I was young and didn’t know how to let people down, so I ended up pretty much leading him on. Then it came to a point where he was asking for pictures, and in my head there was no reason not to, so I sent them. 

  Over time I slowed responses with him but still would be overly nice to him since I was scared of making him feel like crap because he didn’t have many friends and he clearly REALLY liked me, but in the end that just made him rely on me more.

  Now every couple months he’ll say something like “hey I miss you, I still think about you every day” and I typically ignore it until the chat expires but sometimes I ask how his life’s been to be there and all despite not having feelings for him nor wanting to talk to him. I just feel bad.

He just texted again today after 6 months saying “hey (my name) I miss you lots and and still think of you daily hope you’re doing good”

How do I stop this without hurting him too much?","tamam şimdi eğer şimdi hala bana mesaj atıp beni sevdiğini ve her gün beni düşündüğünü söyleyen bir adam varsa nasıl bitirebilirim

zamanla ona karşı tepkilerimi yavaşlattım ama yine de ona karşı aşırı nazik oldum çünkü çok fazla arkadaşı olmadığı ve beni gerçekten sevdiği için onu berbat hissettirmekten korkuyordum ama sonunda bu sadece bana daha fazla güvenmesini sağladı

şimdi her birkaç ayda bir hey seni özlüyorum hala her gün seni düşünüyorum gibi bir şeyler söylüyor ve ben genellikle sohbet sona erene kadar görmezden geliyorum ama bazen hayatının nasıl geçtiğini soruyorum orada olmak ve hepsi ona karşı hislerim olmamasına ve onunla konuşmak istemememe rağmen sadece kötü hissediyorum

aylar sonra bugün tekrar mesaj attı, merhaba adım, seni çok özledim ve hala her gün seni düşünüyorum, umarım iyisindir

onu çok fazla incitmeden bunu nasıl durdurabilirim"
"Trigger warning! Sexual assault Throw away account for obvious reasons

I don’t remember what age it started but my sister is only 3 and a half years older than me, I remember she used to lay me on the bed and grind on me and kiss me and I didn’t know what it was or what she was doing. This happened to years from what I remember until I was around 8 and I told her to stop or I’ll tell someone. There were a few times I asked her to stop when she’d do it and she said it was okay and it’s meant to feel good.

The earliest memory is when I was about 4/5 so she would’ve only been 7/8. I am now 24 and I don’t know why but it keeps creeping into my brain. I’ve never talked to her about it or ever told anyone, I’ve been to therapists for other reasons but I never told them because it’s so embarrassing. I feel so gross just thinking about it. I don’t even know if she remembers but I feel like she’d be the same very embarrassed. We don’t talk much as it is since we live in different states but we have a family vacation planned in 6 months and I just don’t want to face her. I don’t know if she knew what she was doing but I was just a kid and it’s messed me up heaps when it comes to sex.

I feel so disgusting and I feel like there’s something wrong with me to not say anything to anyone.

I don’t know if I should talk to her about it please advice

  
edit: I am female, I was born female and I dentify female

thank you to everyone for your kind words, our childhood was awful and filled with physical abuse from our parents 

i dont think I will talk to her I think I will just talk to my therapist. It is hard for me to speak it, when I get nervous it’s like I can’t physically talk, so I will take the suggestion and write it down for my therapist thank you","tetik uyarısı cinsel saldırı hesabı açık sebeplerden dolayı at

"hi everyone, i (19f) have serious concerns for my boyfriends (20m). for context, we used to live together and our bathroom was fairly close to our room. i
would hear him flush and the sink would never turn on. i’m not a creep but it came to a point i started noticing because when he would touch my face, the stench would get there before his hands would. i never said anything i would usually just offer a hand massage since he’s a guitar player and he likes them because his hands cramp up. but before the massages i’d clean them vigorously with hand sanitizer. i even tested out my theory once i moved out of his house. i drew on his hand with eyeliner a bunch of small cute drawings, when we went on a date three days later they had only faded a smidge. ??? i promise im not being judgmental and before anyone says he could be depressed, trust me, im his safe space and i know that he’s not plus it’s been like this for a few years now. another note, i used to wash our clothes when we lived together and (not that i purposely checked) but his boxers always had skid marks all the way up the back waistline. i ended up buying him dudewipes to help but still. always found stains. again i never said anything but i am a huge hygiene freak like its a little bad. anyways. i’m looking for advice on how to tell him this nicely, he’s a little sensitive and YES i’ve tried the whole nice passive or indirect ways of letting him know. i’m not gonna sit here and pretend like i don’t shower sometimes but it can get pretty bad. he will stay in the same socks for a few days and i started noticing fungus on his toes. i am a nail/ toe tech and have tried indirectly saying how to take care of it but he doesn’t catch on. i am concerned for his health as well. how do i help? men? i’m not trying to make anyone insecure i simply want a clean boy with good health and hygiene. also skip (nsfw) he often has a lot of cleanliness problem even down there. even after he showers. there’s dead skin under his foreskin, old semen, or sometimes toilet paper. and when he hints that he wants a bj i swallow my pride. can someone give me hygiene tips to pass along. i’m sorry im sure this paragraph is all over the place but im spewing whatever i can think of. i know a lot of guys also do the scratch n sniff with their balls but he does it so often that im concerned. like i mean a couple times an hour if we’re just chilling in his bed. again i love my boyfriend a lot but i want him to be set up for success. i appreciate any advice. i’ll also be open to answering questions for clarification 

UPDATE: hi reddit. i just wanted to clear some things up. i call myself a hygiene freak because it was only recently that i started really getting into extra clean hygiene. i’ve been with my boyfriend for five years. i started noticing his uncleanliness when i moved in with him a year ago. i moved out for many reasons but one was the fact that he was uncleanly. so yes i took steps for myself. he was not always this uncleanly. it just got worse recently and that’s why im asking for help. some how many commenters flipped this on me saying im the disgusting one. i get it. i can’t be a “hygiene freak” and love a dirty person right. i do love my boyfriend very much but i didn’t know if i wanted to leave him over his hygiene i felt like that was harsh. while half of you have threw up in the comments, i have received some insightfully understanding responses. which i appreciate. and for the few comments saying im embarrassing him and threatening to find out who i am and send him this post, you’re probably offended that you also get skid marks in your boxers. i’ll be posting an update tonight when i have a conversation with my boyfriend and let you know what happens.

"I'm one of only a handful people of my race at my job and I'm the only vegetarian. Most of the people are from a culture where from what I understand vegetarianism isn't really a thing.

About twice a month the production supervisor and temp service liaison plan a lunch party in the break room. It's twice as long as a regular lunch and there isn't really anyplace to eat besides the break room. So far there has never been any food a vegetarian can eat, so I always eat my own lunch those days. Every time the two people I mentioned ask me why I don't want anything and I say I'm a vegetarian so I can't eat any of this. I've asked them both numerous times if they can let me know ahead of time next time they are planning something so that I can bring an item I'm able to eat to share ot pay for a plain cheese pizza or whatever but they never do.

I do legitimately believe they don't understand what a vegetarian is. The one supervisor once asked me if I don't like the taste of shrimp, and I said I don't know what shrimp tastes like because I've never tried it bc I'm a vegetarian and I can never eat any animals. She seemed so confused, I think they really don't consider and aren't aware of that fact that people like me exist.

So now it's a situation where I get upset because they keep offering me stuff I can have no matter how many times I say I can't have it, and they seem moderately offended that I'm asking to bring my own food or order something special. I get a lot of questions and awkward looks when I'm in there during the party eating cold noodles or whatever. What's the best way to handle this?

gerçekten vejetaryenin ne olduğunu anlamadıklarına inanıyorum bir keresinde bir süpervizör bana karidesin tadını sevip sevmediğimi sordu ve ben de karidesin tadını bilmediğimi çünkü hiç denemediğimi söyledim çünkü vejetaryenim ve hiçbir hayvanı yiyemem çok kafası karışmış gibiydi bence onlar gerçekten benim gibi insanların var olduğu gerçeğini düşünmüyorlar ve farkında değiller

"So my girlfriend (F19) and I (M21) have been together for 6 months now. And today she just said that there’s something I should know. Back when she was with her ex (now M21), she had told him of a traumatic experience of some creep grabbing her ass.

"update on this post, (read this one first), https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/0ftEsxJOVT

After discussing with my girlfriend last night, I decided that it was better to just apologize, because 1) I felt bad for John and 2) I wanted to make this situation easy for Angela. Even though Steve is a huge piece of shit, Angela wanted to keep him and I didn't wanna make that decision for her. We both decided that tomorrow morning (today), we will call Angela over and talk this out.

Everything was going as planned. We called Angela, She came over, I apologized to her for ruining the dinner and said I will apologize to John about the snarky comment. She basically said that she appreciated me doing that.

To arrange this meeting, Angela called Steve but as we kinda expected he didn't answer and was continuing the silent treatment. Since he didn't reply, we called his mom, she did pick up but hung up as soon as she heard Angela's voice. (tbh, internally I was thinking, wtf is this family).

Our last option was to call the dad (we didn't have John's contacts) and so we did. He greeted us quite nicely and then we went to explain how we would like to meet up again and apologize to John.

basically this how it went, ""Hey, this is (name) from last night and I would like to apologise to your son, John."" ""Apologise? you? why? He should say sorry for leaving the room over some rice."" ""I understand that, sir but I shouldn't have made the rude comment, especially to your autistic son."" and I kid you not, there was a long pause before he said, ""I have an autistic son????""

TURNS OUT, THERE IS NO FUCKING PERSON IN THAT FAMILY WHO IS AUTISTIC.

we all went ???? because that's what Steve said to Angela? Right? Neither us nor the dad has any idea about why Steve lied to us.

Frankly, we are pretty scared to confront those guys. Me, my gf and my friend, all of us are in a foreign country, with no families (especially my friend) all we got is each other. We are barely in our 20s and these guys are way older then us. Steve was quite aggressive, screaming and yelling on the last call. He knows where we live and we are losing our shit.","bu gönderi hakkında güncelleme önce bunu okuyun httpswwwredditcomramitheassholesftesxjovt

her şey planlandığı gibi gidiyordu angela'yı aradık o geldi akşam yemeğini mahvettiğim için özür diledim ve john'dan da alaycı yorumum için özür dileyeceğimi söyledim temelde bunu yapmamı takdir ettiğini söyledi

bu toplantıyı ayarlamak için angela steve'i aradı ama beklediğimiz gibi cevap vermedi ve cevap vermediği için sessiz kalmaya devam etti annesini aradık açtı ama angela'nın sesini duyar duymaz kapattı içten içe bu aile ne diye düşündüm

son seçeneğimiz babayı aramaktı john'un iletişim bilgileri yoktu ve biz de aradık bizi oldukça güzel karşıladı ve sonra tekrar buluşmak istediğimizi ve John'dan özür dilemek istediğimizi açıklamaya gittik

temel olarak şöyle oldu hey bu dün geceden bir isim ve oğlunuzdan özür dilemek istiyorum John özür dilerim neden pirinç için odadan ayrıldığı için özür dilemesi gerekiyor anlıyorum efendim ama özellikle otistik oğlunuza bu kaba yorumu yapmamalıydım ve şaka yapmıyorum otistik bir oğlum olduğunu söylemeden önce uzun bir duraklama oldu

o ailede otistik olan hiç kimse olmadığı ortaya çıktı

"Several months ago I was going to do a TikTok trend where you compare the pics you've taken with the ones your husband takes. He was out of the house with his newly upgraded phone, leaving his old phone behind. I went to his photos and found n@ked pics of his ex from before we were even together, meaning he's kept them for over 15 years. Not only that, but because they were originally in a fake calculator app, he had to manually transfer them to every single new phone he's had (about 5 or 6 phones, I think) by removing them from the locked fake calc app, putting them in Google photos, linking his Google account to his new phone, saving the pics to his phone, then moving them to the fake calculator app, and deleting them from Google photos. 

After all these years it means he had the pictures in his phone when I was giving birth, our wedding day, during his vows to me at alter, while he was proposing (which was an embarrassing proposal with no thought put into it), on our 10 year wedding anniversary trip...this whole time those pics of her were in his pocket. 

I confronted him and he said she means nothing to him and that the pics were just p0rn for him. He kept her pics and ones I've sent to him over the years in the same locked folder, saying he uses them when he's away on work trips. 

Of course, I deleted them off of Google photos, from the trash, the fake calculator app, and from every single old phone of his (he kept them all). 

I've always thought she was really pretty, and over the years I've had two kids and one big health problem, so of course I've gained weight over the years. So the next day I spiraled. I did a fake tan, did my nails, got my hair done, and took new pics of myself. I wanted him to find me attractive and not to want (or miss) her pics anymore. It's been about four months and I still fall back into this horrible mindset all over again and refresh my look again. 

I dug through every single thing on his phone and laptop and didn't find anything else incriminating. So, as far as I know, he's only had these specific pics. 

She was his first. Is it normal for guys to keep pics of their first? Should I believe him that he just used the pics as ""p0rn"" since I didn't find anything else bad? 
","birkaç ay önce kocanızın çektiği fotoğraflarla sizin çektiğiniz fotoğrafları karşılaştırdığınız bir tiktok akımı yapacaktım, yeni yükseltilmiş telefonuyla evden çıkmıştı eski telefonunu geride bırakmıştı fotoğraflarına gittim ve daha birlikte olmadan önceki eski sevgilisinin çıplak fotoğraflarını buldum bu da onları yıllardır sakladığı anlamına geliyor sadece bu değil ayrıca başlangıçta sahte bir hesap makinesi uygulamasında oldukları için onları sahip olduğu her yeni telefona manuel olarak aktarmak zorundaydı sanırım onları kilitli sahte hesap makinesi uygulamasından kaldırarak google fotoğraflara koyarak google hesabını yeni telefonuna bağlayarak fotoğrafları telefonuna kaydedip sonra sahte hesap makinesi uygulamasına taşıyarak google fotoğraflardan silerek 

bunca yıldan sonra bu demek oluyor ki doğum yaptığımda, düğün günümüzde bana yemin ederken, bana evlenme teklifi ederken fotoğrafları telefonunda tutuyordu, bu utanç verici bir teklifti ve hiç düşünülmeden yapılmıştı evlilik yıldönümümüzde bunca zaman boyunca onun fotoğrafları cebindeydi 

onunla yüzleştim ve onun kendisi için hiçbir şey ifade etmediğini ve resimler sadece onun için prn'lenmişti, onun resimlerini ve yıllar boyunca ona gönderdiklerimi aynı kilitli klasörde sakladı ve iş gezilerinde olduğunda kullandığını söyledi

elbette onları çöp kutusundan google fotoğraflarından sildim, sahte hesap makinesi uygulamasından ve her eski telefonundan hepsini sakladı

her zaman onun gerçekten güzel olduğunu düşünürdüm ve yıllar içinde iki çocuğum ve büyük bir sağlık sorunum oldu, bu yüzden elbette yıllar içinde kilo aldım, bu yüzden ertesi gün spirale girdim, sahte bronzlaştım, tırnaklarımı yaptırdım, saçımı yaptırdım ve kendimin yeni resimlerini çektim, beni çekici bulmasını ve artık onun resimlerini istememesini veya özlememesini istedim, yaklaşık dört ay oldu ve hala bu korkunç zihniyete tekrar geri dönüyorum ve görünümümü tekrar tazeliyorum

telefonundaki ve dizüstü bilgisayarındaki her şeyi tek tek araştırdım ve suçlayıcı başka bir şey bulamadım, bildiğim kadarıyla sadece bu belirli resimleri vardı

o onun ilkiydi, erkeklerin ilklerinin resimlerini saklaması normal mi, ona inanmalı mıyım, sadece resimleri prn olarak kullandığına, çünkü ben başka kötü bir şey bulamadım"
"My 16yo, for the last couple of years, had a bit of skater kid stereotype going. He had long hair, distressed jeans, kind of the fashion look where he pretends like he doesn't care how he looks (but actually does;)

A few weeks ago he switched from contacts to glasses, which surprised me because he has always hated wearing glasses. I asked why, and he just said he wanted to push himself to get use to them. He then chopped his hair, going from long hair skater, to clean cut back and sides. He then started wearing his smartwatch religiously, again something he's had for years but has never worn.

He also clearly started dressing different, more neater (dare I say frat-ier with polos/khakis). My husband and I think it's because he's found a girl...","son birkaç yıldır yo'm kaykaycı çocuk klişesine sahipti, uzun saçları ve yırtık kot pantolonları vardı, nasıl göründüğünü umursamıyormuş gibi davrandığı ama aslında umursadığı bir moda görünümü

"I’d never really thought about it this way before but would love to know what others think. 

My husband has somewhat of a short fuse. It doesn’t always end up in an angry outburst, but a lot of the time it does. Some of these times are related to playing video games.

Well this morning he got angry at a game and I guess crunched his keyboard to death? So much so that his hand was bleeding. Anyways shortly after this he announced he was heading down to the ‘store’. We both knew what that meant but I asked where and he confirmed. 

I don’t feel like getting into it with him this morning because all he’ll do is sulk and be pissy if I said how I feel, but I am frustrated because this is far from the first time this has happened.
Not that I think this is the main factor but we’re not flush with cash or anything, we’re very much regular people who struggle to save money so I don’t love having to replace items he decided it was okay to break. 
Not to mention we have a baby that I don’t want to grow up not knowing the value of anything. 

But today I’ve thought to myself - imagine if I ripped apart my eyeshadow palette in a fit of rage because my makeup wasn’t cooperating with me.. that’s so ridiculous that I’d be too embarrassed to go replace it. I’m not owed extra purchases due to my lack of emotional skills. That’s like rewarding bad behavior. At least that’s how I see it. 

I don’t think I’m the only one experiencing this so I’d love to know what you think. Is it just, that he gets to infinitely spend whatever due to his poor temper? Even if we were millionaires and money wasn’t an issue - I still don’t think this is right. ","Daha önce hiç bu şekilde düşünmemiştim ama başkalarının ne düşündüğünü bilmek isterim

bu sabah bir oyuna sinirlendi ve sanırım klavyesini öyle bir kırdı ki eli kanıyordu zaten bundan kısa bir süre sonra mağazaya gideceğini söyledi ikimiz de bunun ne anlama geldiğini biliyorduk ama nereye diye sordum ve doğruladı

"Hey I need advice. My friend (18f) is getting married in a week to a man (26m) from our church that she has only been dating for 8 months and I don’t feel right about the situation. 

First, he had a crush on her when she was 15. In fact, he liked every girl in our youth group at church including myself and my sister. A week before he even asked my friend out, he told my brother that he liked me a lot, even though he knew I had a boyfriend. 

Second, he has a weird “goal” that he has always talked about which includes getting engaged at least 6 months into the relationship. (Which is exactly what happened)

I’m just not sure about the situation, it seems very sketchy to me. Plus, they never have any fights ever and claim it’s because they’re just more compatible than anyone else. My friend won’t listen to my concerns.

Update on my instructer who inappropriately touches me
(This is an update on my previous post) 

Update: I told my parents... So today about an hour before going to practice I told my parents all about my instructor and ofc they didn't believe me and thought I was being delusional, I even suggested a new place for me to train but they said it's a big hastle to switch to a new place and bla bla bla... I even suggested stopping all together but they refused cause ""they paid a lot of money already"" . I tried arguing but it was worthless. When I got there (the place I train at) my coach called me in to his office and told me that my parents called him to tell him about what I was saying about him. He assured me that he didn't mean to make it seem like that and that he's just trying to do his job then he smirked and walked out. During the training session he continued doing the same stuff but more aggressively but more descritly but I could feel his hands squeezing my but/thighs and pressing my hips on his. What am i supposed to do now? I don't wanna ever go back there I don't want to practice anymore i just wanna disappear. This update turned out pretty long but I wanna say thank you all so much for all the support and love u guys really helped and made me feel appreciated I can't express how much all of this meant to me.

"So I'll try to get to the point here. I was with my ex for 4 years and was truly in love. I thought I would marry her and start a family. Long story short, she had an affair with someone behind my back and it absolutely destroyed me. I am still very heartbroken, angry, disgusted, and hurt. Every part of my being despises her. The man she was with sent me photos and screenshots of them committing these acts, which is how I found out she was cheating.

I instantly broke up with her and haven't looked back. I have absolutely no desire to be with her any longer, and I feel a deep sense of hatred.

However, despite how upset I am over the situation...I've been feeling an urge or ""itch"" to fantasize and even masturbate to the thought of her cheating on me and the images I saw. It is honestly driving me crazy and making me even more upset. I don't understand why I have these urges, but it's honestly making me feel violated. It's almost like I feel forced to rub one out to the thought of something that hurts me. In a way, I feel very violated and I want these feelings to go away so I can move on with my life.

I brought this up to my therapist, and he had absolutely no clue what I was talking about. I know cuckholding is a thing, but that's not me. I'm way too territorial and jealous of a person to act on that. I could really use your input or advice. Thanks for reading. I just hope I can find peace and not be violated by these thoughts anymore. It's honestly making me really depressed.


UPDATE: I never expected this post to get so much attention. I just wanted to thank everyone for their input on my situation. And I'll continue to monitor the comments for people that want to put their 2 cents in. Thank you for all the love and support.","bu yüzden konuya gelmeye çalışacağım, eski sevgilimle yıllarca birlikteydim ve ona gerçekten aşıktım, onunla evlenip bir aile kurmayı düşünüyordum, uzun lafın kısası, arkamdan biriyle ilişkisi oldu ve bu beni tamamen mahvetti, hala çok kalbim kırık, öfkeli, tiksinti duyuyorum ve varlığımın her yerini incitiyorum, ondan nefret ediyor, birlikte olduğu adam bana bu eylemleri gerçekleştirirken fotoğraflarını ve ekran görüntülerini gönderdi, böylece aldattığını öğrendim

"my step-daughter (21f, we'll call her Mary) and my son (20m, we'll call him Louis) have been secretly dating for the past 2 years (or so they say). Mary and Louis have known each other since they were 4 and 3, respectively. Mary's mother (43f, call her Amy) and i (46m) met in a support group for widowers, and we bonded over the fact both of our first spouses were taken from us in workplace accidents. it was a strange thing to bond over, i guess, but, after about 2 years of dating we got married and to this day are very in love. now, as to our step-children, we both have amazing relationships with them. i always refer to Mary as my daughter, and i only clarify she's not related to me here for... well, hopefully obvious reasons, and my wife refers to my bio-son as hers as well. we both legally adopted each and they call us mom and dad instead of step-dad or whatever. Amy and i also have a son together, call him Robby, who's 11.

when they sat us down and told us about their secret relationship, i have to admit i was shocked and disgusted. a lot of things clicked into place, like the fact that neither of them dated in high school despite not being unattractive or socially awkward, or that they had started treating their little brother a bit awkwardly about 5 or 6 years ago (it didn't last long and i chalked it up to teenage hormones at the time), etc. they said it's only been two years, but i didn't believe them when they told us and i don't believe them now. i admit, both i and my wife said things we shouldn't have when they initially told us. i don't want to repeat it but it was bad and we apologized profusely.

we sat down again a few weeks later to talk more about it. they confessed that watching Robby grow and realizing that he'll have kids one day made them feel insecure and upset that their kids won't be related to both of us like Robby's will be. when i asked if that was the only reason they were together, they adamantly insisted that they do actually love each other, but it was ""a consideration"", they admitted. they said that they intend to get married sometime in the next few years and asked for our blessing, which we said we'd have to think about.

i can't shake the feeling that this is wrong. but is it actually wrong or am i blinded by the love i have for Mary as her father? she's not related to Louis, so their kids wouldn't run the risk of being born with 11 fingers or something. and it does seem like they really love each other. but im worried that this is all just spurred on by their desire to have kids related to both of us and that they'll regret this later. or maybe that's just me worrying that i'll regret it somehow. i don't know. i talked to Amy about this and we both ended up having to admit that we like the idea of our grandkids being related to both of us, which, honestly, made my skin crawl to say out loud considering the context. but i don't know why it disgusts me so much. they're not related. it just seems so creepy considering they've referred to each other as brother and sister their whole lives.

am i making too much of a deal out of this? am i still just in shock? they're not related, so why does this bother me so much? is it really wrong or am i being unreasonable?

UPDATE: my wife and i talked with our kids (man this is fucking weird to say) and told them that if in another 3 years they still feel the same way we'll give them our blessing and help with the wedding and such. the comment suggesting a long engagement sounded like a solid idea, and our kids agreed not to get married (good lord help me) til then if it'll make us feel better. i still feel really weird about this though. and yes there will be therapy. a lot of therapy. thanks everyone","üvey kızım f ona mary diyecek ve oğlum m ona louis diyecek son birkaç yıldır gizlice çıkıyorlar mary ve louis'in birbirlerini 1980'lerden beri tanıdıklarını ve sırasıyla mary'nin annesi f ona amy diyor ve ben dullar için bir destek grubunda tanıştık ve ilk eşlerimizin ikisinin de iş kazasında bizden alınması gerçeğiyle bağ kurduk sanırım bağ kurulması garip bir şeydi ama yaklaşık yıllarca çıktıktan sonra evlendik ve bu güne kadar çok aşığız üvey çocuklarımızla ikimizin de harika ilişkileri var mary'den her zaman kızım olarak bahsediyorum ve sadece burada umarım açık sebeplerden dolayı benimle akraba olmadığını açıklığa kavuşturuyorum ve karım da benim biyolojik oğlumdan kendisininki olarak bahsediyor ikimiz de yasal olarak birbirimizi evlat edindik ve bize üvey baba veya başka bir şey yerine anne ve baba diyorlar amy ve benim bir oğlumuz da var ona robby diyorlar kim

birkaç hafta sonra tekrar oturup daha fazla konuştuk, Robby'nin büyümesini izleyip bir gün çocuk sahibi olacağını fark etmenin onları güvensiz hissettirdiğini ve çocuklarının Robby'ninki gibi ikimizle akraba olmayacağı için üzüldüklerini itiraf ettiler, bunun birlikte olmalarının tek nedeni olup olmadığını sorduğumda, birbirlerini gerçekten sevdiklerinde ısrar ettiler ama bunun bir düşünce olduğunu kabul ettiler, önümüzdeki birkaç yıl içinde evlenmeyi düşündüklerini söylediler ve bizim onayımızı istediler, bunun üzerinde düşünmemiz gerektiğini söyledik

bunun yanlış olduğu hissinden kurtulamıyorum ama gerçekten mi yanlış mı yoksa mary'ye olan sevgim yüzünden kör mü oldum, babası louis ile akraba değil, bu yüzden çocukları parmaklı doğma riskiyle karşı karşıya kalmayacaklar ya da bir şey ve gerçekten birbirlerini seviyorlar gibi görünüyor ama endişeleniyorum ki tüm bunlar sadece ikimizle akraba çocuk sahibi olma arzularından kaynaklanıyor ve daha sonra pişman olacaklar ya da belki de bu sadece benim bir şekilde pişman olacağımdan endişeleniyorum bilmiyorum bu konuyu amy ile konuştum ve ikimiz de torunlarımızın ikimizle akraba olması fikrini sevdiğimizi kabul etmek zorunda kaldık ki dürüst olmak gerekirse bağlamı göz önünde bulundurarak yüksek sesle söylemek tüylerimi diken diken etti ama neden bu kadar iğrendiğimi bilmiyorum akraba değiller sadece birbirlerine hayatları boyunca kardeş olarak hitap ettiklerini düşünürsek çok ürkütücü görünüyor

bundan çok mu fazla anlam çıkarıyorum hala şokta mıyım akraba olmadıkları için peki bu beni neden bu kadar rahatsız ediyor bu gerçekten yanlış mı yoksa mantıksız mı davranıyorum

karımla görüştüm ve çocuklarımızla konuştum dostum bunu söylemek çok garip ve onlara başka bir Yıllardır hala aynı şekilde hissediyorlar, onlara onayımızı verelim ve düğün ve benzeri konularda yardım edelim. Uzun bir nişanlılık dönemi öneren yorumlar sağlam bir fikir gibi geldi ve çocuklarımız evlenmemeye karar verdiler, aman Tanrım o zamana kadar bize yardım et, eğer bu bizi daha iyi hissettirecekse. Yine de bu konuda kendimi çok garip hissediyorum ve evet, terapi olacak, çok fazla terapi, herkese teşekkürler."

I know my friend for 10 years and his dad started to touch me when I turned 17, he never done this before. For example, I was outside alone and he brought me a blanket and wraped alround me, then he started to rub my arms. I thought it was weird and after a week he touched my shoulders and he stroked my head. An other time he caressed my back. I feel uncomfortable with him, he never done these things before, but maybe I'm just overreacting it, I don't know what should I do.

"My fiancé has a long term female coworker friend. She texts and calls him every few days about differing topics. I don’t think anything is going on , but long story short I suspect she could have feeling for him. He said he needs their relationship for work connections.

My fiancé said he wants her to come to our wedding but I’ve never met her.

I’ve asked my fiancé several times to arrange a meet up between us. Each time he forgets. I asked him again today. He said he feels awkward to ask her because he never meets her outside work. I really don’t know if he’ll ask her.

I feel really pretty uncomfortable about this situation. He isn’t inviting many people to the wedding (less than 10 as his family aren’t near), so she must be a good friend so why can’t he be open enough to ask her to meet? I was intending on being polite and friendly to her.

Any advice on how to navigate this situation would be appreciated","nişanlımın uzun süredir birlikte olduğu bir kadın iş arkadaşı var, her birkaç günde bir ona farklı konularda mesaj atıyor ve arıyor, bir şey olduğunu sanmıyorum ama uzun lafın kısası, nişanlısının ona karşı bir şeyler hissettiğinden şüpheleniyorum, iş bağlantıları için ilişkilerine ihtiyacı olduğunu söyledi

I (22F) recently had sex with my friend (22M) . I’m not particularly experienced so I want to know if all these points in going to list are acceptable or if I fucked up somewhere

1. He gave me head, I enjoyed it and told him

2. Then I gave him head, he definitely enjoyed it, he told me

"My older sister (23F) had a baby boy in December of 2022. He’s currently 21 months old. From the day she had her son, she handed him over to our mother and wants nothing to do with him. My nephews father is out of the pictures and is not legally allowed to be alone with him because of mental health issues. Just clearing that up for anyone that might ask questions about the father. (My sister has full custody)

My sister wants nothing to do with her son. She says herself she doesn’t care about her son at all. Our mum looks after him 24/7 since he was born. Nearly two years straight and her psychical health is declining because of it. She is absolutely exhausted looking after him. She barely sleeps. Barely has time to eat. She no longer has a life because she’s stuck with a baby. It’s not fair at all and I’m so worried about my mother’s physical and mental health, because she is getting elderly, already in her 60’s. 

We can’t even leave my nephew with my sister for a hour to go grocery shopping because she doesn’t look after him. She will let her own son cry, won’t bother feeding him or changing him and he needs extra supervision because he has a heart condition. She refuses to even go near him, she wants absolutely nothing to do with him. 

I’m only 18 and I try my best to help my mother out with my nephew whenever I can but it’s hard because of my work schedule. We all love him to death. He’s such a beautiful baby. He’s so sweet and cute. I don’t know how my sister can be so heartless to him. She locks herself in her room all day with her new boyfriend and doesn’t come out for days at a time. We all live in the same house yet sometimes I don’t see her for weeks on end because she just locks herself away to escape responsibilities and if you try to talk to her she tries to start a fight. She does nothing with her life. Not working. Doesn’t even own a car. 

I used to be super close with my sister despite the 5 year age gap between us, but ever since she got pregnant and gave birth to her son she has completely changed as a person. And now she’s dating some dirtbag (whom my family dislike very much including myself) and she wants nothing to do with her own family and her son anymore. 

She was diagnosed with Postpartum Depression after giving birth but has not seeked help nor does she want to. She’s living off a single mother’s pension yet none of that money is going towards her son. She did everything she could to gain full custody of him, yet she doesn’t even want anything to do with him. My family have no idea what to do because my mother can’t keep going on like this much longer. She’s so sick and tired, absolutely exhausted looking after a child this young. I feel so sorry for her. 

Please if anyone has any advice on this subject it would be greatly appreciated. We’re in desperate need of assistance. :(

"So basically I attended American elementary school until i was 10 years old, then I was removed to be homeschooled but, due to lack of preparation/education + adhd, my mother struggled to teach me alongside my other siblings, so she gave up entirely.

"I (20F) live in a joint family where my sister in law and her sons are present too. We have common bathroom where everyone keeps their necessary toiletries too.  My nephew (14M) have always been prying in my stuffs and ruins them for enjoyment. Lipsticks, Lipgloss, face creams, moisturisers, snail mucin, serums, you name it. I used to get angry and yell at him later to just give it away accepting the fact that he is a child. 

Now he is 14. And few months ago he filled my face wash with water. I complained about this to his mom to which she asked me to not keep my face wash in the bathroom. I got pissed but later thought that it’s gonna be my only resort since I was the one losing my stuff. So I kept my face wash away. Yesterday, I found half of my body wash gone. Half of the entire bottle empty. Mind you, I only used it twice. I stepped in the bathroom and I could breathe it’s strong scent and found a large heap of foam rising in the komote. I figured that this guy has used it as a hand wash and just played with it emptying half of the bottle. I complained about this to his mom again. She didn’t utter a single word. I had to let it go again. 

Today, he filled water in my cleansing milk bottle. And it is completely watery. I got pissed again and brought it to the notice of his mother. She just expressed her disappointment and that was it. I am fed up of these shits. He is a fucking grown ass now and needs to be held accountable for his actions. He shouldn’t be this entitled. I pay for my own stuffs and he shouldn’t do this. 

I wanna teach him a very good lesson. Can you suggest me some ideas to put him in his place? 

Thank you. 

Update: just today I saw my nephew getting his ass whooped by my SIL quite badly because she was done with his antics. She was also threatening him that she won’t take him with her to Bahrain (where my brother lives). Upon enquiring I got to know that they’ll be leaving for Bahrain in a week. So that’s about it. I think this issue will be off atleast for few months until he comes back. By the time I think I will move out. If not, and this brat continues the same, no mercy will be shown henceforth. Nair to his conditioner straight along with the complain to his dad and compensation for all the destroyed stuffs. 

Also. Thank you everyone for your support and ideas. I felt so validated and supported. Thanks a bunch for all the support.

"I’m a 30F A couple of days a go when I was walking my dog this guys face lit up when he saw me and he was going to say hi like he knew me but stopped mid-word. That day and the next he was kind of following me. I was walking a very crowded trail and he cut to the top of this hill where I was bound to walk by. He just kept appearing. I live on the second floor and I wear nightgowns that are sort of lingerie but my windows aren’t giant windows so you can’t really see from below but if you’re a neighbor with a second floor or higher you can see. But I close my blinds before the sun goes down. This morning I realized there was a man on a roof outside my back window but I don’t wear contacts in my house so couldn’t see where he was looking. An hour later as I was working I gazed out the window thinking and saw a man facing my window on a balcony I quickly looked down grabbed my phone started recording and hurried up and zoomed in on him. He was video tapping me. He laughed when he saw I caught him. My friends think that I should take this much more serious but idk. The way I look at it is he has a crush and crossed the line. I went over there to yell up to his balcony to tell him to stop filming me but he didn’t come out. I just don’t like conflict and really rather not deal with this. I definitely don’t want to get the police involved. I’m a woman of color and just not sure I feel comfortable dealing with them. Am I not taking this seriously enough? 

ADDED: just to be clear the crowded trail is one block away from our street so it’s not that he followed me to a faraway trail. 
Also, he’s recording with his phone and not some specialized camera. If that helps","Birkaç gün önce köpeğimi gezdirirken bu adamın yüzü aydınlandı ve beni tanıyormuş gibi merhaba diyecekti ama o gün kelimenin tam anlamıyla durdu ve ertesi gün beni takip etmeye başladı.

İkinci katta yaşıyorum ve iç çamaşırı gibi gecelikler giyiyorum ama pencerelerim çok büyük değil bu yüzden aşağıdan pek göremiyorsunuz ama ikinci katta veya daha yüksek bir katta oturan bir komşuysanız görebilirsiniz ama bu sabah güneş batmadan önce panjurlarımı kapattım. Arka penceremin dışında çatıda bir adam olduğunu fark ettim ama evimde kontakt lens takmıyorum bu yüzden nereye baktığını göremedim. Bir saat sonra çalışırken pencereden dışarı baktım ve düşündüm ve balkonda pencereme bakan bir adam gördüm. Hemen aşağı baktım, telefonumu aldım, kayda başladı ve aceleyle yaklaşıp onu yakınlaştırdım. Beni videoya çekiyordu, onu yakaladığımı görünce güldü. Arkadaşlarım bunu çok daha ciddiye almam gerektiğini düşünüyor ama bilmiyorum. benim bakış açıma göre aşık olmuş ve çizgiyi aşmış oraya gidip balkonuna bağırıp beni filme almayı bırakmasını söyledim ama dışarı çıkmadı sadece çatışmayı sevmiyorum ve bununla uğraşmak istemiyorum kesinlikle polisi dahil etmek istemiyorum ben siyahi bir kadınım ve onlarla uğraşırken kendimi rahat hissetmiyorum bunu yeterince ciddiye almıyor muyum

"UPDATE: I want to address a few things first. 

A time limit for how long this would go on was never addressed. Daughter even offered to pay for her own phone from her savings, and no one is ok with that because we want her to save it. Adding her to our plan is a financial issue. Not huge, but one we haven't budgeted for yet. The battery issue isn't the only issue, so while I power back would help, it won't fix everything.

That being said, yesterday, Daughter and I were out. We talked about the phone issue. She even offered to give up her allowance to pay for the phone and said she preferred to be on our plan. We were near our local phone store so we stored by. We found out how much it would cost to add her to the plan. After leaving, she looked defeated, then said she could stay babysitting and use all that money to pay for it. I told her I would talk to her dad when we got home. 

She ended up talking to her dad as soon as she could, he told her he'd think about it. Apparently, he had talked to her the day before about it, and she expressed her feelings towards the matter. So between the two conversations he's agreed to put her on our plan with a new phone. If she gets babysitting jobs, she can pay towards it with some of what she earns, but she's not losing her allowance. She doesn't know, but we'll put whatever she gives us in her savings. I was already looking at getting a second job. I work for a school district, I don't make much, and was looking at something on the side to start saving more or maybe not have to work much over the summer.  Hubby can't get a second job because of his disabilities.  

Anyway, the issue is resolved. Daughter will have new phone by end of day. 





TLDR: Daughter's aunts put her on phone plan against our wishes and are now refusing to upgrade her dying phone. Husband refuses to add her to our plan. 

Background: Hubby (53) and I (42) have a daughter (13).  He also has a son (24) from a previous marriage and three older sisters. I'll call them S1, S2, and S3. 

S2 passed away in 2021. She had been living with my MIL, and S1 and S3 lived together as well. After S2's passing, it was decided that MIL, S1, and S3 would get a new house and move in together. One day, my daughter was out at MIL's old house when they were packing up and they gave her S2's cell phone, which was still working. This caused a major issue because Hubby and I felt she didn't need a phone. We lived in a small town where she could walk to school and her friend's houses. If it wasn't close by, she was under the supervision of an adult we knew really well.  They said her brother had had a phone at that age so she should have one too. Her brother had a basic kids phone that only had a few buttons, not even numbers. It was because at the time his mother had not been responsible for her phone bills so Hubby wanted a reliable way to get in contact with her. 

S1 and S3 decided to end the argument by buying my daughter a phone and putting her on their contract. Hubby made it clear that he was not ok with it, he felt she didn't need it, but if they did that, it was all on them, he wasn't going to pay for it. They told daughter she could choose from 2 specific phones because they were free. Hubby did help her do the research, and she decided which phone she wanted. I went with them when they went to get her phone. I bought her a new case and popsocket. My daughter has babied that phone. She's got a carry strap on it and checks her case regularly to make sure her phone is protected. 

Fast forward to now. We've moved to a more rural area. She can walk to a few friend's houses, but for the most part uses her phone to talk to everyone since they're so far away, including her old friends. She's also involved in more activities, and is sometimes with people we don't know at all because we need help sometimes getting her to and from activities. I feel at this point, she needs a phone, hubby does not agree. 

The issue at hand is with the two sisters. The phone is dying. She turns it off at school, and the battery will drop at least 50%.  Many times she's not with us, and her battery will be less than 5%. She doesn't always get texts and has more issues with wifi/mobile data then the rest of us. The first time this was brought up to hubby's sisters, they said that they weren't replacing it because supposedly daughter and I had gone off and picked a whole new phone and it had cost them $100.  Yeah, that didn't happen. We did go look around, but the only change she made was the color of the phone because the sales person asked her, in front of SIL3. I was asked about if we wanted a special plan on the phone because she was a kid, but I said no because I didn't want them to have that much control on her phone. I would have had to ask them to put new numbers on, etc. They were called out on the lie, they tried to say that we needed to put her on our plan, which even MIL said wasn't a good argument because we said no to begin with. Now the argument is that they never said they were going to maintain it. 

Hubby says he feels like it's a trap to force him to pay for a phone. He still feels like she doesn't need it, I feel like she does. The one person in the middle is my daughter, with neither side budging. Daughter is sad, she knows that the way things are going she won't have a phone long. She already has anxiety and mild depression, and I think this is making things worse. If I buy the phone and and add it to our plan, it will cause a huge issue in the marriage. 

I feel like my only recourse is to just add her to our plan. I have to consider her mental health as well in this. Maybe I'm missing something. So I'm here to ask some outsiders what they suggest.","update i want to address a few things first

"My boyfriend (M31) and I (F28) have been on and off for about 5 years, mostly long-distance until recently. I was excited to finally be closer and reconnect when I moved back to the city but since my return, his behavior has changed drastically.

In the past few months, he’s started calling me “stupid” when I’m having a hard time understanding something, like when I was exhausted from a 12-hour drive. He even said he couldn’t be with a ""stupid girl."" He lied about meeting his ex (F26) one night, though he said his friend (M28) invited her and others along but he did provide proof of this but I still found out. Another time, he fought with me in public and stormed off while I was introducing him to my girlfriends, after he misheard something I said, leaving me embarrassed and my friends confused.

He also hates when I hang out with my friends, saying he doesn’t trust them, and accuses me of cheating every time we argue. Things came to a head this past weekend. I was running late to see him because I was helping my mom with a few things before leaving, and he completely blew up, accusing me of having “messed-up priorities” and even cheating. He hung up on me, but I still drove down, feeling like I “owed” him that effort, and now I wish I hadn’t.

My family doesn’t support him, they actually hate him, and won’t even let him into our home. Although that’s really hard I wanted him to be on good terms with my family before proposing and I wanted him to ask my family for permission. I told him early on that I wanted him to ask them for permission before proposing, since we are very close. But instead, he sprung the proposal on me without any heads-up and says it’s now my responsibility to tell them. He’s made it clear that if they’re not on board, he’ll just go forward without their support.

What’s worse, we’d just had another huge fight right before he proposed, so it felt more like a burden than something joyful. I ended up saying yes, mostly because I felt backed into a corner and worried about how he’d react if I didn’t. Now, I feel sick about it. I’m not excited or proud—I’m filled with anxiety, and I don’t even want to tell my family. It feels wrong that he disregarded my wishes about involving my mom, and I don’t feel any joy from this proposal.

I’m realizing I don’t want this future with him, but I’m not sure how to tell him. How do I approach this conversation, and is it even possible to make him understand that this just isn’t what I want? Any advice would be so helpful.
","erkek arkadaşım m ve ben yaklaşık yıllardır çoğunlukla uzun mesafeli olarak görüşüyoruz, ta ki yakın zamana kadar, şehre geri taşındığımda sonunda daha yakın olmak ve yeniden bağ kurmak için heyecanlıydım ama döndüğümden beri davranışları kökten değişti

geçtiğimiz birkaç ayda, bir şeyi anlamakta zorluk çektiğimde bana aptal demeye başladı, örneğin bir saatlik yolculuktan yorgun düştüğümde, aptal bir kızla birlikte olamayacağını bile söyledi, bir gece eski sevgilisiyle buluştuğunu söyledi, arkadaşı m'nin onu ve diğerlerini davet ettiğini söyledi ama bunun kanıtını verdi ama yine de başka bir zaman öğrendim, benimle halk içinde kavga etti ve kız arkadaşlarımla tanıştırırken bir şeyi yanlış duyunca öfkeyle uzaklaştı, beni utandırdı ve arkadaşlarımı şaşırttı

ayrıca arkadaşlarımla takıldığımda onlara güvenmediğini ve her tartıştığımızda beni aldatmakla suçladığını söylüyor, işler çığırından çıktı, geçen hafta sonu onu görmeye geç kaldım çünkü ayrılmadan önce anneme birkaç konuda yardım ediyordum ve tamamen patladı, önceliklerimi karıştırdığımı ve hatta aldatma telefonu yüzüme kapattı ama ben yine de ona bu çabayı borçluymuşum gibi hissederek arabayı sürdüm ve şimdi keşke yapmasaydım

ailem onu ​​desteklemiyor, aslında ondan nefret ediyorlar ve hatta evimize bile almıyorlar, gerçi bu gerçekten zor olsa da teklif etmeden önce ailemle iyi geçinmesini istedim ve ailemden izin almasını istedim, ona çok yakın olduğumuz için teklif etmeden önce onlardan izin almasını istediğimi baştan söyledim ama bunun yerine bana hiçbir uyarıda bulunmadan teklifi yaptı ve onlara söylemenin artık benim sorumluluğum olduğunu söyledi, eğer onlar kabul etmezlerse cehennemin onların desteği olmadan devam edeceğini açıkça belirtti

daha kötüsü, teklif etmeden hemen önce yine büyük bir kavga ettik, bu yüzden neşeli bir şeyden çok bir yük gibi hissettim, sonunda evet dedim çünkü köşeye sıkışmış hissettim ve eğer yapmazsam nasıl tepki vereceği konusunda endişelendim, şimdi bunun için kendimi hasta hissediyorum, heyecanlı ya da gururlu değilim, kaygıyla doluyum ve aileme bile söylemek istemiyorum, annemle ilgili isteklerimi göz ardı etmesi yanlış geliyor ve bu tekliften hiçbir sevinç duymuyorum

anlıyorum Onunla böyle bir gelecek istemiyorum ama ona bu konuşmaya nasıl yaklaşmam gerektiğini nasıl söyleyeceğimden emin değilim ve ona bunun istediğim şey olmadığını anlatmam mümkün mü? Herhangi bir tavsiye çok yardımcı olurdu."

TLDR;
gf wanted me to cut porn cause it made her insecure but her phone is full of porn. 

soo im gonna get straight in to it. 
I used to watch a lot of porn. Girlfriend didn’t feel comfortable with that so i stopped watching it for her. I switched to erotica. she felt uncomfortable with that as well. So then i solely relied on her. 

our sex life hasn’t been so good, lately i feel like we’ve been doing her fantasies or we have sex when she wants it and hardly ever when i want it. 

this morning i was on her phone and i went on google and all i seen was porn in her search history… my heart started racing because she is so against me watching it and felt insecure but according to her watch history she watched it when i was at work.. she told me she doesn’t watch it at all or have any interest in it (before i found it in her phone)
I have no idea how i want to confront her. I don’t know how i feel in the moment.. I feel like when i did it she in a way weaponized her feelings and made it about her insecurities, but snuck and did something she knew would be unfair behind my back.. She makes it so hard to trust her cause this kinda isn’t the first time i’ve caught her doing something she’s against… 
any tips 😕

not sure if i’m in the right community if not i will remove. 

Edit: thanks for all replies. ","tldr
kız arkadaşım pornoyu kesmemi istedi çünkü bu onu güvensiz kılıyordu ama telefonu pornoyla dolu

bu yüzden hemen konuya gireceğim
eskiden çok fazla porno izlerdim kız arkadaşım bundan rahatsız oldu bu yüzden onun için izlemeyi bıraktım erotikalara geçtim o da bundan rahatsız oldu bu yüzden tamamen ona güvendim

seks hayatımız son zamanlarda pek iyi değil sanki onun fantezilerini yapıyormuşuz gibi hissediyorum ya da o istediğinde seks yapıyoruz ve ben istediğimde neredeyse hiç yapmıyoruz

bu sabah telefonundaydım ve google'a girdim ve gördüğüm tek şey arama geçmişinde pornoydu kalbim hızla çarpmaya başladı çünkü izlememe karşıydı ve güvensiz hissediyordu ama izleme geçmişine göre ben işteyken izlemiş ve telefonunda bulmadan önce hiç izlemediğini ya da ilgilenmediğini söyledi
onunla nasıl yüzleşmek istediğimi bilmiyorum o an nasıl hissettiğimi bilmiyorum sanki yaptığımda bir şekilde duygularını silah olarak kullanmış ve bunu kendisiyle ilgili hale getirmiş güvensizlikler ama gizlice ve arkamdan haksız olacağını bildiği bir şey yaptı, ona güvenmeyi çok zorlaştırıyor çünkü bu onu karşı olduğu bir şeyi yaparken yakaladığım ilk sefer değil

"When he was 13 he got interested into trading for a little while but then he lost interest in that. Some years passed since then, during those years he was addicted to videogames and eventually reached a low point. He decided to drop them and focus on what he wants to do in his life.


He got back into trading and has became hyperfocused on trading so much to the point that he doesn't care about anything else in his life. He looks at charts all day and is constantly studying. This has been going on for about 6 months now.


I support his commitment and dedication towards trading however I do worry sometimes. He barely goes out of the house and he doesn't have a social life. He doesn't seem to care about his family much as there has been many occasions where they have come over and he'll just stay in his room looking at the charts.


He is very ambitious and has said to me numerous times that he wants to be successful and rich. I'm not sure if there's anything I can do to help him, should I do anything or let him continue how he has been?

Edit: Thanks everyone ","o zamanlar bir süreliğine ticarete ilgi duydu ama sonra ilgisini kaybetti, o zamandan beri birkaç yıl geçti, o yıllarda video oyunlarına bağımlıydı ve sonunda dibe vurdu, onları bırakmaya ve hayatında yapmak istediklerine odaklanmaya karar verdi

"im at a loss, i can't even comprehend like how i feel about this whole thing i just feel uneasy and need a place to rant. i apologise if this isn't the best place to do so but i'm just at a loss on what to do now.

a little background info:
- we've been together for almost a year 
- we've slept together many times before dating
- we are each other's first time
- we are both 18 now (he was 17 i was 18 in the earliest video i found) 
he's honestly the most sweetest bf ever, he says and shows that he loves me, reassures me every day, never laid hands or hurt me in anyway and just generally makes me feel so safe. i just never expected him to do this which is why im so confused and in a way i feel betrayed.

i trust him enough to not feel the need check his phone, but our 1 year anniversary is coming up and the gift i had in mind involved finding some pictures from a specific date that he might've had on his phone. he consented in giving me his phone while he was at work, and i feel so bad about 'invading' his privacy but i was curious on his hidden photos album considering i never really went on his phone (he tells me that he keeps my nudes on there that i shared willingly, and i was just curious on whether that was the case). and so i clicked on it and all i found were multiple videos of him secretly recording us having sexual intercourse. videos of him literally setting up his phone in a hidden spot in the room when i wasn't aware in order to record us. these videos dated back to the early stages of our relationship which was about a year ago with the most recent one being from this monday and i'm only just finding out about it now. i'm just so upset because he has never once told me and i don't think he plans to either. he tells me that he only wants me all the time, but also in that folder were pics/videos of specific onlyfans girls. now this wouldnt be such a huge deal if it were just that, but i do remember explicitly saying i wasn't comfortable with him masturbating to other women let alone to multiple saved videos of them. and his response to that was that he only finds me attractive and wouldn't do such a thing. but if i were to have specific guys in my albums that i find 'hot', he wouldnt approve and tell me to 'find someone better', or leave him for someone who's 'better looking.' i understand he might suffer from low self esteem and have jealousy issues, but he has this tendency where if i were to watch, for example, a tiktok video of a relatively attractive guy, he would insist that i leave him for this other guy thats 'more attractive'. it just feels like such a double standard that i didn't expect to feel. but thats not the major problem here, its the fact that he intentionally set up his phone to record us having sex, on many occasions. it just hurts so bad because i never expected this from him. and right now i feel like im overreacting because we've been in a relatively healthy relationship for the past year. i dont know what to do, i feel like i havent fully processed my emotions. i want to scream and confront him but the same time i feel like i cant. i feel so trapped

early on in the relationship i told him about this 'fear' that i have (being that i constantly feel like im being recorded when alone) and i dont know if that contributed to him doing this or not? im at a loss beacuse he seems like such a sweet and genuine person, he always reassures me and tells me that he would never do anything that i wouldnt want but then proceeds to secretly film me in such a vulnerable state on many occasions. its just causing so many doubts and questions i never thought i would have about our relationship. im starting to question like, is he over-reassuring me to the point that i feel at complete ease so he could take advantage of that and do this sort of thing? all this anxiety about this situation is just eating me alive and i dont even want to imagine having to confront him about this. im scared that something might change between us and i dont want our relationship to fall apart. i know what he did is wrong and the best thing to do is talk about it but i feel so betrayed and what if im just a toy to him, i can't bear the truth if he really is just using me. id rather just swallow this up and never mention it. im so scared i don't know what else he's capable of. i never once thought that he would do something like this, he's always fond on the 'no secrets' rule we have and i trust him with all my heart, but after this i just feel so uneasy.

i am so sorry if this didnt make much sense or if i didnt add enough background info. please feel free to ask. i would really appreciate any kind of advice on what to do, or just any words that may help ease this tension i feel. thank you for reading","şaşkınım bu konuda ne hissettiğimi bile anlayamıyorum sadece huzursuz hissediyorum ve sızlanmak için bir yere ihtiyacım var eğer burası bunun için en iyi yer değilse özür dilerim ama şimdi ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum

biraz geçmiş bilgisi
neredeyse bir yıldır birlikteyiz
çıkmadan önce birçok kez birlikte yattık
birbirimizin ilk seferiyiz
ikimiz de şimdiyiz o bendim bulduğum ilk videodaydım
dürüst olmak gerekirse o şimdiye kadarki en tatlı erkek arkadaş, beni sevdiğini söylüyor ve gösteriyor her gün bana güven veriyor asla el kaldırmadı veya beni hiçbir şekilde incitmedi ve genel olarak beni güvende hissettiriyor sadece bunu yapmasını beklemiyordum bu yüzden kafam çok karışık ve bir bakıma ihanete uğramış hissediyorum

telefonunu kontrol etme ihtiyacı hissetmeyecek kadar ona güveniyorum ama yıl dönümümüz yaklaşıyor ve aklımdaki hediye telefonunda olabilecek belirli bir tarihten bazı fotoğraflar bulmaktı işteyken telefonunu bana vermeyi kabul etti ve mahremiyetini ihlal ettiğim için çok kötü hissediyorum ama onun hakkında merak ediyordum gizli fotoğraf albümü, telefonunu hiç kullanmadığımı düşünürsek, bana orada gönüllü olarak paylaştığım çıplak fotoğraflarımı sakladığını söyledi ve bunun böyle olup olmadığını merak ettim ve bu yüzden tıkladım ve bulduğum tek şey, gizlice bizi cinsel ilişkiye girerken kaydettiği birden fazla videoydu, bizi kaydetmek için odadaki gizli bir noktaya telefonunu kurduğunun videoları, bu videolar ilişkimizin ilk aşamalarına, yani yaklaşık bir yıl öncesine dayanıyor, en sonuncusu bu pazartesiden ve ben bunu yeni öğrendim, çok üzgünüm çünkü bana hiçbir zaman söylemedi ve söylemeyi de planladığını sanmıyorum, bana sadece beni her zaman istediğini söylüyor ama ayrıca o klasörde belirli onlyfans kızlarının fotoğrafları ve videoları vardı, şimdi sadece bu olsaydı bu çok büyük bir sorun olmazdı ama açıkça başka kadınlara mastürbasyon yapmasından rahatsız olduğumu söylediğimi hatırlıyorum, onların birden fazla kaydedilmiş videolarından bahsetmiyorum bile ve buna cevabı, beni sadece çekici bulduğunu ve böyle bir şey yapmayacağını söylemesiydi ama eğer albümlerimde bulduğum belirli erkekler olsaydı sıcak onaylamaz ve benden daha iyisini bulmamı veya daha güzel birini bulmamı söylerdi, düşük öz saygıdan muzdarip olabileceğini ve kıskançlık sorunları yaşayabileceğini anlıyorum ama şöyle bir eğilimi var, örneğin nispeten çekici bir adamın tiktok videosunu izlersem benden daha çekici olan başka bir adam için onu terk etmem konusunda ısrar ederdi, bu beklemediğim bir çifte standart gibi hissettiriyor ama buradaki asıl sorun bu değil, telefonunu bilerek birçok kez seks yaparken bizi kaydedecek şekilde ayarlamış olması çok acıtıyor çünkü ondan bunu hiç beklemiyordum ve şu anda aşırı tepki veriyormuşum gibi hissediyorum çünkü son bir yıldır nispeten sağlıklı bir ilişkimiz var ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, duygularımı tam olarak işlemediğimi hissediyorum, bağırıp onunla yüzleşmek istiyorum ama aynı zamanda yapamayacağımı hissediyorum, kendimi çok sıkışmış hissediyorum

ilişkinin başlarında ona sahip olduğum bu korkudan bahsettim, yalnızken sürekli kaydedildiğimi hissediyorum ve bunun onun bunu yapmasına katkıda bulunup bulunmadığını bilmiyorum, çok tatlı ve gerçek bir insan, bana her zaman güvence verir ve asla istemediğim bir şeyi yapmayacağını söyler ama sonra beni birçok kez bu kadar savunmasız bir halde gizlice filme alır, bu da ilişkimiz hakkında hiç düşünmediğim kadar çok şüphe ve soruya neden olur, beni tamamen rahat hissetmem için aşırı mı rahatlatıyor diye sorgulamaya başlıyorum, böylece bundan faydalanıp böyle şeyler yapabilir, bu durum hakkındaki tüm bu kaygı beni yiyip bitiriyor ve onunla bu konuda yüzleşmek zorunda kalmayı bile hayal etmek istemiyorum, aramızda bir şeylerin değişebileceğinden korkuyorum ve ilişkimizin dağılmasını istemiyorum, yaptığı şeyin yanlış olduğunu biliyorum ve yapılacak en iyi şey bunun hakkında konuşmak ama kendimi çok ihanete uğramış hissediyorum ve ya onun için sadece bir oyuncaksam? beni gerçekten kullanıyorsa gerçeği kaldıramıyorum, bunu yutup hiç bahsetmemeyi tercih ederim, çok korkuyorum, başka ne yapabileceğini bilmiyorum, böyle bir şey yapacağını hiç düşünmemiştim, her zaman sahip olduğumuz sır saklamama kuralına düşkündür ve ona tüm kalbimle güvenirim ama bundan sonra kendimi çok huzursuz hissediyorum

ben eğer bu pek mantıklı gelmediyse veya yeterli arka plan bilgisi eklemediysem özür dilerim lütfen sormaktan çekinmeyin, ne yapmam gerektiği konusunda herhangi bir tavsiyeniz veya bu gerginliği hafifletmeye yardımcı olabilecek herhangi bir kelimeniz varsa çok sevinirim, okuduğunuz için teşekkür ederim"
"I’m so fucking unbelievable angry. she won’t tell me who, when or where it happened. I don’t blame her at all, I’m just PISSED OUT OF MY FUCKING MIND that it happened. I’m not angry at her at all, don’t get me wrong. 

how do I support her without making her feel worse? when she sees that I’m angry she gets even more upset about what happened. please please please give me advice

edit: 

yes, this was recent. she told me that it happened within the last week. I live 2 hrs from her, so I see her every other week. she won’t tell me who it was, but she said it was in a car. this is what I told her before going to sleep last night:

“I also want you to know that I believe you. I feel you so deeply with this. I’m here whenever you want to talk about it. but unless you bring it up, I won’t bring it up again. I don’t want to remind you about this. but it is also important for you to seriously process this and work through it, instead of shoving it down and pretending it didn’t happen. I don’t want you to live with this forever because you didn’t want to talk about it. of course, you don’t have to do that right now. I know how overwhelming this is. take your time baby. I’m here and I’ll be here no matter what. and des, even if you are pregnant, I’ll hold your hand through it all, okay? I love you so much baby “

her main concern is being pregnant. she says that she took plan B after. she also says that there was no penetration. I have near to no information on exactly when, who and where is happened

we are lesbians 

edit 2:

she also was talking to me 3 days ago about how she “wanted to touch a penis”. she said that because she didn’t get to see one during her hoe phase, it’s been something she thinks about frequently. she has stressed that she only wanted to touch it, not anything else. I found that whole idea odd but I love her so of course, I just listened., I offered to go with her whenever she wants to touch one. I AM AWARE of how strange this is, but I just wanted her to know that I supported her

literally that same day she told me that she wanted to try penetration. she has always been very clear that she does not find penetration appealing whatsoever. I told her that I would be willing to help her explore this, and she was grateful for my offer but seemed like she really wanted it from a man

I don’t know how I feel about this whole situation. I’m still torn. I love her so much

edit 3:

she has been VERY transparent in telling me that she had cheated on her past girlfriends

I’m scared. my mind is in so many places. last night, she made me promise not to talk about it anymore. I’m so incredibly confused. I decided to get a gym membership to cope (I don’t have money for therapy)","inanılmaz derecede sinirliyim bana kim olduğunu, ne zaman olduğunu veya nerede olduğunu söylemiyor onu hiç suçlamıyorum sadece olanlardan dolayı aklımı kaçırmış durumdayım ona hiç kızgın değilim beni yanlış anlamayın

ayrıca birkaç gün önce bana bir penise dokunmak istediğinden bahsediyordu orospu evresinde bir penisi göremediği için bunun sık sık düşündüğü bir şey olduğunu ve sadece ona dokunmak istediğini vurguladığını söyledi başka bir şey değil tüm bu fikri garip buldum ama onu seviyorum bu yüzden tabii ki sadece dinledim ona dokunmak istediğinde onunla gitmeyi teklif ettim bunun ne kadar garip olduğunun farkındayım ama sadece onu desteklediğimi bilmesini istedim

tam olarak aynı gün bana penetrasyonu denemek istediğini söyledi penetrasyonun ne olursa olsun çekici gelmediğini her zaman çok net bir şekilde söyledi ona yardım etmeye istekli olduğumu söyledim bunu keşfetti ve teklifim için minnettardı ama bunu gerçekten bir erkekten istiyormuş gibi görünüyordu

"He got a ride with her to his job and she kept talking negative about me claiming I was cheating and everytime he mentions me she says ew. She has also before ran in and jumped on top of him while he was in his boxers in bed? Why does she keep doing this ? I know know he isn't doing anything with her it's her that's causing the issues. 
Update he has cut her off by reading the comments. I had thoughts it was cause she wanted him I allowed him to be friends with her because one I didn't want to be controlling and two they been friends longer than we have been together. I was always told not to worry about her. I always felt crazy. So thank you everything for your advice and thanks for bringing it to light for my boyfriend.😊","onunla işe gitti ve o benim hakkımda olumsuz konuşmaya devam etti, aldattığımı iddia etti ve her seferinde benden bahsettiğinde ""iyy"" diyor, daha önce de koşarak gelip yatakta boxer'ıylayken üstüne atlamıştı, neden bunu yapmaya devam ediyor, biliyorum, onunla hiçbir şey yapmıyor, sorunlara o sebep oluyor
güncelleme, yorumları okuyarak onu hayatından çıkardı, bunun sebebinin onu istemesi olduğunu düşündüm, onunla arkadaş olmasına izin verdim çünkü birincisi, kontrolcü olmak istemiyordum ve ikincisi, birlikte olduğumuzdan daha uzun süredir arkadaştılar, her zaman onun için endişelenmemem gerektiği söylendi, her zaman kendimi çılgın hissettim, bu yüzden tavsiyelerin için ve erkek arkadaşım için bunu gün yüzüne çıkardığın için çok teşekkür ederim"

EDIT thank you for all the comments, I’m going to tell him tomorrow :)

UPDATE he called me a dumb ugly slut. Quite hurtful but oh well. I’m very sad but I’ll be okay. I’m glad it happened now instead of later if the relationship got more serious.

"My (F30) brother (M23) tried it on with my boyfriend (M29.)
Me and my boyfriend have been together for 7 years and we have a 4 year old together. 
I was in bed, and our daughter was out for the night. 
My boyfriend was up late watching UFC, my brother messaged him saying “oh *F30* was last active on Facebook 15 minutes ago, has she gone to bed” and my partner replied to explain yeah and he was up watching tv and drinking and smoking a little weed. My brother then proceeded to say “I wish I was there with you, I’ve felt like this way for a long time.” My partner felt incredibly uncomfortable, told him to shut up, and said he was absolutely shocking to try it on with his sisters boyfriend. 
My brother asked him to act like it hasn’t happened, my partner told me as soon as I woke up the next day. My brother was really, really drunk when he sent those messages. Like stupid next level drunk, I don’t believe he would have sent a message like this sober. 
Me and my brother have always been REALLY close, like best friends so this has absolutely knocked me for six. My dad and stepmum are mortified by what he’s done, and have confronted him. 
I messaged him on Monday night saying I’m absolutely heartbroken and feel sick that he would do this, not only to me but to his niece to try and like ruin our family like this? Not that my boyfriend would have EVER, he’s straight. 
My issue is my brother has not replied to my message, he hasn’t messaged me to say sorry, he hasn’t begged for forgiveness instead he is tweeting about eastenders and just completely ignoring me despite knowing how upset I am. 

I need advice on what to do now, I am really at a loss. Do I rip into him? Do I block him and just lose that relationship? I am really struggling. ","f kardeşim m erkek arkadaşımla denedi m

kardeşim ondan hiç olmamış gibi davranmasını istedi partnerim bana ertesi gün uyandığımda kardeşimin o mesajları gönderdiğinde gerçekten çok sarhoş olduğunu söyledi aptalca bir üst seviye sarhoşluktu böyle bir mesaj atacağına inanmıyorum ayıkken
kardeşimle ben her zaman çok yakın arkadaş gibi olduk bu yüzden bu beni kesinlikle alt üst etti babam ve üvey annem yaptıklarından dolayı mahcup oldular ve onunla yüzleştiler

"I (15F) was just minding my own business while on my phone in the living room with my mom and suddenly she blurts out that she had installed mini cameras in my room and that my dad also helped too. She said that she’ll check the footage in a month and that I better make sure that I’m on my best behavior. 

I didn’t believe her at first so I decided to ask my dad when he comes back from work, thankfully he came home and I quickly asked him if that was true. And he said it was. I’m actually so terrified right now, not because I did anything bad, because that’s creepy as hell. They probably will see me changing and stuff and they know how uncomfortable I am when people (yes ESPECIALLY family) watches me change. 

I wasn’t sure if they were joking because I can’t understand social cues. They even told my brother that they also put cameras in my room.

But my mom was laughing, a whole lot. Like I geninuely wanted to punch her in the face because of that laugh. It sounded like she was mocking me.

I hate that laugh.

Even if they were joking, that’s not something to joke about. They know how uncomfortable I get over stuff related to this. 

My parents and I have a rocky relationship and they always wondered why I always lock my self in my room away from them but it’s because of these types of shits they pull to either be funny or controlling. Now they took away my only safe private space.

I wanted to call the cops, but I genuinely don’t know if they were joking and I don’t think the police will take me seriously.

Sometimes I just want to curl up into a ball and wish I didn’t existed, or better yet I wish I wasn’t born into a family like mine.

I don’t know what to do and I’m terrified, I already tore up my room to find the cameras and now I have to go back and clean it up.

What should I do?

Edit 1: I forgot to mention that my mom told me that they will be checking the “footage” at the end of the month. I don’t want to ask them again if they’re lying because they’re going to assume that I have something to hide from them. I’ll keep you guys updated it anything happens.

Edit 2: I’m getting a lot of dms from older men on here asking me to send the footage of me undressing if I end up finding the cameras so I might delete this post soon, I knew it was a bad idea to come for advice here but I really don’t have anyone else to ask and my friends are fed up with me asking for help.

Update: So it ended up being all a joke. I had to find out the hard way, I couldn’t sleep at all last night and I ended up trashing up my whole room to find the cameras and then having a panic attack in the middle of the night. 

My parents rushed into the room and had to comfort me. My mom told me that she was just trying to scare me so I can stay out of my room because I always stay locked up in there and either sleep for the rest of the day or just lay on my bed on my phone. 

Honestly, she knew better than to say a joke like that. Again, she was laughing about the whole situation. It seems like my mom loves seeing me in misery or just hates me, probably both at this point. 

My dad didn’t say anything but he scoffed at me and went back to bed. I don’t think my dad likes me either because all he ever does is laugh at me.

Anywho thank you all so much for helping me I am very grateful.","Annemle oturma odasında telefonda konuşurken kendi işime bakıyordum ve aniden odama mini kameralar yerleştirdiğini ve babamın da yardım ettiğini söyledi, bir ay içinde görüntüleri kontrol edeceğini ve en iyi davranışlarımı sergilemem gerektiğini söyledi

İlk başta ona inanmadım, bu yüzden babam işten döndüğünde ona sormaya karar verdim, şükürler olsun ki eve geldi ve hemen bunun doğru olup olmadığını sordum ve doğru olduğunu söyledi, aslında şu anda çok korkuyorum, kötü bir şey yaptığım için değil, çünkü bu cehennem kadar ürkütücü, muhtemelen beni değişirken ve benzeri şeylerde görecekler ve insanlar evet özellikle ailem beni değişirken izlediğinde ne kadar rahatsız olduğumu biliyorlar

Şaka yapıp yapmadıklarından emin değildim çünkü sosyal ipuçlarını anlayamıyorum, hatta kardeşime odama kamera yerleştirdiklerini bile söylediler

Ama annem çok gülüyordu, sanki o gülüşünden dolayı yüzüne yumruk atmak istiyordum, sanki benimle dalga geçiyormuş gibi geliyordu

Bu gülüşten nefret ediyorum

Şaka yapıyor olsalar bile bunun şaka yapılacak bir şey olmadığını biliyorlar rahatsızım bununla ilgili şeyleri atlatıyorum

ebeveynlerimle inişli çıkışlı bir ilişkimiz var ve neden kendimi her zaman onlardan uzakta odama kilitlediğimi hep merak ettiler ama bunun sebebi komik olmak ya da kontrolcü olmak için yaptıkları bu tür saçmalıklar şimdi tek güvenli özel alanımı elimden aldılar

polisi aramak istedim ama şaka yapıp yapmadıklarını gerçekten bilmiyorum ve polisin beni ciddiye alacağını sanmıyorum

bazen sadece kıvrılıp bir top gibi olmak ve keşke var olmasaydım ya da daha iyisi benimki gibi bir ailede doğmamış olmayı diliyorum

ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum ve çok korkuyorum kameraları bulmak için odamı dağıttım ve şimdi geri dönüp temizlemem gerekiyor

ne yapmalıyım

düzenleme annemin bana ay sonunda görüntüleri kontrol edeceklerini söylediğini söylemeyi unuttum onlara yalan söyleyip söylemediklerini tekrar sormak istemiyorum çünkü onlardan saklayacak bir şeyim olduğunu varsayacaklardır bir şey olursa sizi bilgilendireceğim

düzenleme burada benden mesaj göndermemi isteyen yaşlı erkeklerden çok sayıda DM alıyorum soyunurken çekilmiş görüntülerim kameraları bulursam bu gönderiyi yakında silebilirim buraya gelip tavsiye almamın kötü bir fikir olduğunu biliyordum ama gerçekten sorabileceğim başka kimse yok ve arkadaşlarım yardım istememden bıktı

güncelleme bu yüzden sonunda hepsi bir şakaymış zor yoldan öğrenmek zorunda kaldım dün gece hiç uyuyamadım ve kameraları bulmak için tüm odamı dağıttım ve sonra gecenin bir yarısı panik atak geçirdim

annem ve babam odaya koştu ve beni rahatlatmak zorunda kaldı annem bana sadece beni korkutmaya çalıştığını söyledi böylece odamdan uzak durabilirim çünkü her zaman orada kilitli kalıyorum ve günün geri kalanında ya uyuyorum ya da sadece yatağımda telefonumla yatıyorum

dürüst olmak gerekirse bir daha böyle bir şaka yapmaması gerektiğini biliyordu tüm durum hakkında gülüyordu annem beni sefil halde görmeyi seviyor gibi görünüyor ya da benden nefret ediyor muhtemelen bu noktada ikisi de

babam hiçbir şey söylemedi ama bana alaycı bir şekilde baktı ve yatağa geri döndü sanırım babam da beni sevmiyor çünkü her şey o her zaman bana güler

neyse, bana yardım ettiğiniz için hepinize çok teşekkür ederim, çok minnettarım"

"I've been with my wife for about 5 years now. We have a 4 year old daughter together. Up until this point she's given no indication of racism.

However - recently during a discussion when talking about my uncle I mentioned how I think he's racist as he had an issue when his daughter started dating a black guy a few years prior.

During this convo, my wife said ""I'm not racist but I would have a little bit of a problem with that too.""

I was taken aback. My wife could see how shocked I was and she tried to walk it back. I asked her to explain what she meant and she refused, continually wanting to just move on.

It's been two days and I just can't look at her the same. She says she didn't mean it, but I think she just saw how upset I was. I don't think she's completely racist, but I also don't think you can have even a little problem with your daughter dating a black person and not be at least a little racist. 

Honestly, I don't know if I can ever move on.

Should I let it go? Should I leave her because this could just be the tip of the iceberg? Should I try and force a conversation even though she so far seems unwilling?

Thanks for any advice!","Yaklaşık yıllardır eşimle birlikteyiz, şu ana kadar bir yaşında bir kızımız var, ırkçılık belirtisi göstermedi

Ancak yakın zamanda amcam hakkında konuşurken, birkaç yıl önce kızının siyah bir adamla çıkmaya başlamasıyla ilgili bir sorun yaşadığı için onun ırkçı olduğunu düşündüğümü söyledim

Bu konuşma sırasında eşim ırkçı olmadığımı ama bununla ilgili de biraz sorunum olacağını söyledi

Şaşkınlığa uğradım, eşim ne kadar şok olduğumu görebiliyordu ve geri adım atmaya çalıştı, ne demek istediğini açıklamasını istedim ve sürekli olarak devam etmek istedi

İki gün oldu ve ona aynı şekilde bakamıyorum, bunu kastetmediğini söylüyor ama sanırım sadece ne kadar üzgün olduğumu gördü, tamamen ırkçı olduğunu düşünmüyorum ama ayrıca kızınızın siyah biriyle çıkmasıyla ilgili en ufak bir sorununuz varsa bile en azından biraz ırkçı olabileceğinizi düşünmüyorum

Dürüst olmak gerekirse devam edebileceğimden emin değilim

Bırakmalı mıyım, onu terk etmeli miyim çünkü bu sadece bir ipucu olabilir buzdağının dışında, şimdiye kadar isteksiz görünse bile bir konuşmayı zorlamaya çalışmalı mıyım

"So I just turned 22. For as long as I can remember my breasts have always felt lumpy/ bumpy inside. I wouldn’t say I feel like a marble but I feel bumps that almost feel like they have limes on them (I’m guessing tissue) and I feel other random lumps and bumps in there and most of them move I believe. I just find my boobs r very soft and squishy and I can feel so much inside there it’s hard to tell if I should be worried about something or not. I have health anxiety and I was crying today about it because I can’t tell if I should be concerned about a lump or not:( My mom and both grandmas have not had breast cancer however apparently my great grandmother did.

"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for about a year now.  Her ex-boyfriend passed 3 years ago.  She hasn't really brought him up beside a few mentions of how he passed and how she loved him when they were together.

Yesterday she posted a picture on IG, from her memories, where she is at his gravesite.  She has a note written in Spanish in the picture which translates to ""Maybe not, for now, but go and tell the next life that it is ours.""

For some reason it made my stomach turn.  I was supposed to see her yesterday after she came back from from a vacation trip, but that post made me come up with an excuse not to see her last night.  The use of those words gave me feelings of jealousy.  I feel like I'm overreacting by having these emotions towards someone she'll never see again, but it definitely affected me.  Should I tell her how it made me feel and am I justified for feeling this way?","kız arkadaşımla yaklaşık bir yıldır çıkıyoruz eski sevgilisi yıllar önce öldü, birkaç kez nasıl öldüğünden ve birlikteyken onu ne kadar sevdiğinden bahsetmesinin dışında pek bahsetmedi

I have all but decided that I will terminate the pregnancy but I feel immense guilt. I have always wanted children, and I still do, but I know this would not be a good situation to bring one into.

"I recently found out that H (29F) has been cheating on her bf J (36) for the past year with multiple people. They have been together for 6 years

She has been having sex with one friend B regularly for the past year. She also had a threesome recently while he was stoned at home cleaning the flat/apartment.

I've found out about this over the course of the last 3 months. Everyone but him knows now. she's complaining every week now, about how she isn't sure if she should break up with J and she isn't sure if she'd want to date B. It apparently started because 2 years ago H discovered Js online chat with some girl across the Atlantic. He'd been telling online girl that he loved her.

Edit : I've just found out that he once said he wouldn't handle it well if she ever cheated. I don't know if this means crying or violence.

TLDR: She's been cheating for a while and keeps complaining she doesn't know if she should break up with her BF. It's getting annoying and I want to know, should we tell him? HOW do I tell him if I do?

Edit: I AM ABOUT TO TELL HIM. I'll update reddit on how it goes.


Update : I have told her she has till 8pm 21th February to break up with him or tell him or I'll tell him. 
Then I'll check on him to make sure it was done right. 
To the people suggesting I date either of them, I'm not interested. 

Also I showed her the Reddit post.
I'll update after the deadline passes. ","yakın zamanda h f'nin erkek arkadaşı j'yi birkaç kişiyle aldattığını öğrendim, yıllardır birlikteler

"title, my (M24) gf (f25) keeps accidentally hurting me and I cant narrow down how I am supposed to feel on situations like this. 

For our most recent problem, I was trying to look at a menu for a restaurant we were going to on her phone. I opened her web browser and I was greeted with the front page of tinder. Her explanation to me was she accidentally clicks on tik tok ads sometimes and she showed me another tab of another ad she accidentally clicked on.

Other things like 9 months into the relationship and my laptop dies and I go onto her laptop and she's randomly logged into an old instagram account ive never heard of where she's being very promiscuous and hasnt been used in 3 years. ""oh I accidentally logged into this account for \[reason\], I was going to delete it"". 

I could recite multiple scenarios of stuff like this happening but the situation itself is not the point, the point is the dynamic. 

I find something odd/makes me uncomfortable -&gt; I start overthinking -&gt; ""oh I know this looks bad but its actually not bad"" -&gt; explanation for something is sound -&gt; I realize I was stupid -&gt; im supposed to just feel fine","başlık kız arkadaşım bana sürekli yanlışlıkla zarar veriyor ve bu gibi durumlarda nasıl hissetmem gerektiğini daraltamıyorum

ilişkinin aylarca sürmesi ve dizüstü bilgisayarım kapanması ve onun dizüstü bilgisayarına girdiğimde rastgele eski bir instagram hesabına giriş yapmış olması, hiç duymadığım çok ahlaksız olduğu ve yıllardır kullanılmadığı bir hesap, oh yanlışlıkla bu hesaba giriş yaptım, onu silmek istiyordum

bu gibi şeylerin yaşandığına dair birden fazla senaryo sıralayabilirim ama asıl mesele durumun kendisi değil, mesele dinamik

"After 4 years of heavy drinking I finally gave in and went to rehab to medically detox. It was the best decision I ever made and I do not regret it. The main thing that held me back from going to rehab in the first place was my job. I am an assistant for a realtor so I am her only employee. We work at a brokerage with 150+ other agents that I’m pretty good acquaintances with. I knew that my sudden absence would definitely raise questions, however another assistant in our office went to rehab last year for 6 weeks and her boss had everyone convinced she had a family emergency. I didn’t even know she went to rehab until she told me months later. 

Today my husband went to my office to bring my boss my company credit card because she needed it. At the front desk the girl goes “we’re all rooting for your wife and hope she’s doing well.” Basically the entire office knows I’m at rehab. While it shouldn’t be something to be ashamed of, it’s something I wanted to keep private and I’m livid. (I should also note I live in the south with a lot of very judgmental people)

I thought heavily about quitting my job before I went to rehab but always felt guilty about quitting since I’m her only employee and I would need to train the new employee on a LOT. What do I even do now? Do I quit? I can’t even imagine stepping foot back into that office. All of this has caused so much added stress that I cannot handle right now. Please any advice.

"My boy friend and I have been together for over a year. Our relationship was perfect, he treated me great, we barely fought, he never gave me reason to not trust him. He doesn’t text any girls, he barely uses Snapchat and he has never once flirted with a girl or done anything suspicious. The other day I was on his laptop and I saw in his recently deleted photos he had a bunch of screenshots of different girls instagram posts. Some of them were his ex crushes from the past, some were girls in his class, and 2 of them are my roommates/best friends. There was also a bunch of these same pictures ai photoshopped to be naked. My first instinct was that he was doing this as a joke with his friends because I know they all have chat gpt 4 or whatever and they were just messing around. When I confronted him about it, his face dropped and immediately started to apologize. He eventually admitted that he had jerked off to these pictures but felt horrible after and deleted them all. I’m not really sure what to do. This feels like it is basically cheating. Not to mention how disturbing it is that he was ai photoshopping my roomates to be naked. And the other girls were girls he had liked in the past before our relationship. He has profusely apologized, admitted how ashamed he is, and swears it only happened once. He now is saying he is going to see a therapist and he’s willing to do anything to make it right. I’m not sure what to do. He genuinely seems very remorseful and I know that this is not who he is as a person. He fucked up pretty bad and it’s pretty disgusting what he did, but do I throw away my whole relationship over this? Do I have any self respect if I go back to him and give him another chance? 

Also for context, we are both 20 and in college. He came clean about everything when I caught him. He said it happened one time and he was so disgusted with himself that he deleted it all, but I found it in his recently deleted. He made the decision to go to therapy completely on his own, and is repeating over and over how disgusted and remorseful he feels. I feel like I caught him in a moment of weakness and this isn’t a reflection of who he is. ","erkek arkadaşımla bir yıldan fazla bir süredir birlikteyiz, ilişkimiz mükemmeldi. bana harika davrandı, neredeyse hiç kavga etmedim, ona güvenmemem için bana hiçbir sebep vermedi, hiçbir kıza mesaj atmıyor, snapchat'i neredeyse hiç kullanmıyor ve hiçbir zaman bir kızla flört etmedi veya şüpheli bir şey yapmadı. geçen gün dizüstü bilgisayarındaydım ve yakın zamanda sildiği fotoğraflarda farklı kızların instagram paylaşımlarının bir sürü ekran görüntüsü olduğunu gördüm. bazıları geçmişteki eski hoşlandığı kızlar, bazıları sınıfındaki kızlar ve onlar da oda arkadaşımın en yakın arkadaşlarıydı. ayrıca bunların bir sürü çıplak olmak için fotoşoplanmış fotoğrafları vardı. ilk içgüdüm bunun arkadaşlarıyla şaka amaçlı yaptığını düşünmemdi çünkü hepsinin chat gpt'si veya benzeri bir şeyleri olduğunu biliyordum ve sadece dalga geçiyorlardı. onunla yüzleştiğimde yüzü düştü ve hemen özür dilemeye başladı. sonunda bu fotoğraflara bakarak mastürbasyon yaptığını itiraf etti ama sonra kendini çok kötü hissetti ve hepsini sildi. ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, bu temelde aldatma gibi geliyor, oda arkadaşlarımı çıplak olmak için fotoşoplaması ve diğer kızların da kendisi gibi kız olması ne kadar rahatsız edici olduğundan bahsetmiyorum bile. ilişkimizden önce geçmişte çok özür dilemişti, ne kadar utandığını itiraf etmişti ve bunun sadece bir kez olduğunu söylemişti, şimdi bir terapiste gideceğini ve bunu düzeltmek için her şeyi yapmaya hazır olduğunu söylüyor, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, gerçekten çok pişman görünüyor ve bunun bir insan olarak kendisi olmadığını biliyorum, oldukça kötü bir şekilde berbat etti ve yaptığı oldukça iğrenç ama bunun için tüm ilişkimizi çöpe mi atsam, ona geri dönüp ona bir şans daha verirsem kendime saygım kalır mı?

ayrıca bağlam için ikimiz de ve üniversitede her şey hakkında dürüst davrandı, onu yakaladığımda bir kez olduğunu ve kendinden o kadar tiksindiğini söyledi ki her şeyi sildi ama yakın zamanda sildiğimde buldum, terapiye tamamen kendi başına gitme kararı aldı ve ne kadar tiksindiğini ve pişman olduğunu tekrar tekrar söylüyor, sanki onu bir zayıflık anında yakalamışım gibi hissediyorum ve bu onun kim olduğunu yansıtmıyor"

"I’m just thinking about buying it myself. Partner and I have been together for 3 years, living together for 2. Usually, if it breaks we’ll buy a plan B, and everything is fine. Even still, I have bad anxiety and will worry, but it logically settles me to know at least I took extra precaution. 

Last night when it happened my bf was chill. I felt like he took a couple seconds to pull out but he says it wasn’t even in. Thins morning he told me I’m overthinking, that he wouldn’t have had sex with me if he knew it would cost $50, that I’m being a baby, etc. I’m not working, but have savings. He works part time but pays our rent and is looking for a second job. Money can be tight sometimes. 

In my opinion, all the more reason to sacrifice getting a plan B now, because we can’t afford a kid. He told me I’m not ovulating (just had my cycle) and there’s no way I’m pregnant. I just feel alone in this, and my intuition is telling me it’s better to be safe than sorry but my partner is trying to convince me I’m just overreacting.","sadece kendim satın almayı düşünüyorum, partnerim ve ben yıllardır birlikteyiz, genellikle bozulursa bir plan b satın alırız ve her şey yolunda gider, yine de kötü bir kaygım var ve endişeleniyorum ama mantıksal olarak en azından ekstra önlem aldığımı bilmek beni rahatlatıyor

bence bir plan b almaktan vazgeçmek için daha fazla sebep var çünkü bir çocuk sahibi olamayız, bana yumurtlamadığımı söyledi, sadece adet dönemim oldu ve hamile kalmam imkansız, bu konuda kendimi yalnız hissediyorum ve sezgilerim bana güvende olmanın üzgün olmaktan daha iyi olduğunu söylüyor ama partnerim beni aşırı tepki verdiğime ikna etmeye çalışıyor"
"For context i’m 17M and i’ve been dating this girl for about a week now. 

So the other day i was at my girlfriend’s house, we were talking and she got a notification from a guy on snapchat and she went in the “saved in chat” section where i saw that she’d been sending explicit photos to him while we were in the talking stage. To add to this, she slept with him 3 days after she came to see me. (this was before we officially got together. 

Another thing i want to add is that she’d sent me a skimpy photo a while back, but i saw on her snapchat as well that she’d sent the same picture to another guy as well. 

This is all in the back of my mind bothering me a lot at the moment, and i need some advice on how to handle the situation. 



UPDATE - Thanks for all the comments guys, was useful to get different perspectives on it. Spent some time evaluating what i wanted while skating.

"Individual who we’ll call Ryan(20) isn’t necessarily an alcoholic, they just made this idiotic decision to drive drunk. The parents are posting to facebook asking for support for the individual as they were in “a serious crash.” No detail of drunk driving is ever mentioned, which makes people assume that the individual wasn’t at fault. He was going 90 mph in a 35mph area that is super public.

Many friends and family have donated money and set up GoFundMes, which I believe many of them don’t even know the story. Family also set up a candle lighting at the hospital. The situation has gotten so big that shirts and yard signs with his face are being sold. Many local businesses have even posted the “Ryan Strong” posts on their pages. The parents claimed they didn’t ask for any of the GoFundMes or candle lighting, but they could have shut it down themselves instead of letting it continue. I feel that the parents should get support as they didn’t have any fault in the disaster, but I guess I’m just concerned about the aftermath when he’s fine and people find out they were giving money to a drunk driver. 

I just feel that this situation should have been kept way more quiet. While asking for prayers for a serious situation is fine, only telling half of a story and still asking for support doesn’t sit right with me. 

TLDR: Drunk driver became hospitalized due to accident, parents are making him a victim and leave out the part of being drunk to get more support. 

Should I let unaware friends and family know what he actually did?","Ryan'ı arayacak kişi mutlaka alkolik olmak zorunda değil, sadece sarhoş araba kullanma gibi aptalca bir karar aldılar ebeveynler facebook'ta ciddi bir kazaya karıştıkları için birey için destek istiyor, sarhoş araba kullanmanın hiçbir detayı belirtilmiyor, bu da insanların bireyin hatası olmadığını varsaymasına neden oluyor, aşırı kamusal bir alanda mph hızla gidiyordu

"TLDR: One of my best friends had sex with the girl I was dating and they both lied afterwards. Eventually I heard that it happend through another friend. I confronted him with this and said that I felt betrayed. He apologised but somehow I can’t seem to recover from it. I feel angry when I think about it and don’t know how to deal with it. 

So last year one of my friends has gotten a new girlfriend. That girlfriend was going out with us a lot, which was really nice. One time she invited a friend of hers over. I’ve met her that time and we really hit it off. 

We went out for a couple of months and things were going really wel. The only problem was that’s she lived one hour away from me (driving distance). Because of that we didn’t see each other very often. So we called and FaceTimed every day. 

Then after two months of dating we had a festival in our village and she also came along. I was very happy to see her again. But during the festival she kind of ignored me which I found really odd. I decided to let it slide.

After the festival we had an after party at our mutual friends place. Most of my friends were there, plus ofcourse the girl I was seeing. I eventually had to leave because I had an appointment the next morning. I said goodbye to her and said that I would see her the next day. She decided to sleep over and so did one of my best friends. They slept in the same room and eventually had sex with each other. 

I didn’t know at the time (ofcourse). But the girl got really weird with me. She blamed me for things I didn’t do and said maybe it would be better if things came to an end. I was really confused. So a couple of days went by and we ended things. 

I noticed that something was going on between her and my friend so I asked what was up. They both said that they slept in the same room but that nothing happened.  

Two months later I heard through a friend what happened and got really shocked. I felt really betrayed and angry. But since I don’t want to break our friendship I decided to just tell that I knew and say that I felt betrayed. He apologised for the matter and confessed that he felt really bad about it and knew that he was in the wrong. 

I thought that that would end the matter but one year later I can’t forget the matter. Every time I think about I feel really betrayed and angry. I literally crushes me.  

How can I learn to cope with this? All advice is very much appreciated. Thanks in advance. ","tldr en yakın arkadaşlarımdan biri çıktığım kızla seks yaptı ve ikisi de sonrasında yalan söyledi sonunda bunun başka bir arkadaşım aracılığıyla olduğunu duydum bununla yüzleştim ve ihanete uğramış hissettiğimi söyledim özür diledi ama bir şekilde bundan kurtulamıyorum bunu düşündüğümde öfkeleniyorum ve bununla nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum 

geçtiğimiz yıl arkadaşlarımdan biri yeni bir kız arkadaş edindi o kız arkadaş bizimle çok dışarı çıkıyordu bu gerçekten güzeldi bir keresinde bir arkadaşını davet etmişti o zaman tanışmıştık ve çok iyi anlaşmıştık 

birkaç ay çıktık ve her şey çok iyi gidiyordu tek sorun benden bir saat uzakta oturuyor olmasıydı bu yüzden birbirimizi çok sık göremiyorduk bu yüzden her gün arayıp görüntülü konuşuyorduk 

sonra iki aylık flörtün ardından köyümüzde bir festival vardı ve o da yanımıza geldi onu tekrar gördüğüm için çok mutluydum ama festival sırasında beni görmezden geldi ki bu bana çok tuhaf geldi bu yüzden görmezden gelmeye karar verdim

festivalden sonra ortak arkadaşlarımızın evinde bir after party yaptık arkadaşlarımın çoğu oradaydı ve tabii ki görüştüğüm kız da vardı sonunda ayrılmak zorunda kaldım çünkü ertesi sabah randevum vardı ona veda ettim ve ertesi gün onu göreceğimi söyledim o da kalmaya karar verdi ve en yakın arkadaşlarımdan biri de öyle yaptı aynı odada uyudular ve sonunda birbirleriyle seks yaptılar

o zamanlar bilmiyordum tabii ama kız bana karşı çok garip davrandı yapmadığım şeyler için beni suçladı ve belki de her şey bitse daha iyi olur dedi çok kafam karışıktı bu yüzden birkaç gün geçti ve ilişkimizi bitirdik

onunla arkadaşım arasında bir şeyler olduğunu fark ettim bu yüzden ne olduğunu sordum ikisi de aynı odada uyuduklarını ama hiçbir şey olmadığını söylediler

iki ay sonra bir arkadaşım aracılığıyla olanları duydum ve çok şok oldum kendimi gerçekten ihanete uğramış ve öfkeli hissettim ama arkadaşlığımızı bozmak istemediğim için bildiğimi ve ihanete uğramış hissettiğimi söylemeye karar verdim o da özür diledi ve bunun için gerçekten kötü hissettiğini ve yanlış yaptığını bildiğini itiraf etti

bunun meseleyi bitireceğini düşündüm ama bir yıl sonra bu konuyu unutamıyorum her düşündüğümde kendimi gerçekten ihanete uğramış ve öfkeli hissediyorum kelimenin tam anlamıyla beni eziyor

bununla başa çıkmayı nasıl öğrenebilirim tüm tavsiyeler çok takdir edilir şimdiden teşekkürler"
"Hi. So I have a professor who teaches a democracy class. For context, I am the only person in that class from a third world country and rest are all Americans. My professor is 86 and has extensive experience in the field and is highly regarded. 

In his class, I am always looked at to really give my insights and opinions because they want to hear my perspective and I bear the burden of representation of a third world country. 

We were talking about racism and ever since I came to US, I have come across so many terms that I have always called all of them racism back in my country e.g xenophobia, Islamophobia, anti-semitism, ethnicity discrimination, color etc.

But then, I came across material that specified racism as based on race i.e based on physical/biological traits. And the extensive way it is categorized here in the US. Back in my country, there is a hell lot of religious discrimination and gender discrimination. That is the major forms of injustice and discrimination. But the documentation and categorization on the basis of color isn't there in the form that is in the way it is in US. So I pointed that out because I was genuinely confused about the interchangeable terms of discrimination based on race and discrimination based on ethnicity and religion. Are they the same thing or not? I asked this from my professor twice, once in class and once out of class.

Now my friend tells me, he was going around telling people there is that one student in my class who thinks racism doesn't exist in his country. That he doesn't acknowledge it. And I'm like???? What's happening here?

This is upsetting me and I need advice on whether I should clarify this with him. I already feel out of place in his class.","merhaba, demokrasi dersi veren bir profesörüm var.

Ama sonra ırkçılığın ırka dayalı, yani fiziksel-biyolojik özelliklere dayalı olduğunu belirten materyalle karşılaştım ve burada ABD'de kategorize edilme şekli çok geniş, ülkemde çok fazla dinsel ayrımcılık ve cinsiyet ayrımcılığı var, bunlar adaletsizliğin ve ayrımcılığın başlıca biçimleri ancak renge dayalı dokümantasyon ve kategorizasyon ABD'deki gibi değil, bu yüzden bunu belirttim çünkü ırka dayalı ayrımcılık ve etnik kökene ve dine dayalı ayrımcılık terimlerinin birbirinin yerine kullanılabilmesi konusunda gerçekten kafam karışıktı, bunlar aynı şey mi değil mi? bunu hocama iki kez sordum, bir kez derste ve bir kez ders dışında

"So one day I borrowed my moms phone so that I could update my girl (my own phone died) while switching accounts, I saw some dude on my mothers account.. 

I saw a message and got intrigued so I opened it.. (regret opening it tho..) After seeing it, I saw and noticed their texts acting a little too close with each other.. Frequent updates, venting out, and a whole lot of odd stuff..

 At first I thought that maybe they were just friends or smthn.. but then I saw a message that really got to me.. It said ""You deleted the messages that needed to be deleted?"" And Mom replies with ""Yes, since yesterday"" and that shocked me.. Before I got to scroll and see more, Mom requested to have the phone again.. 

For two days I have been wondering what those deleted texts were.. Things that needed to be deleted? what did that mean?.. And so I was overthinking until a couple hours earlier when I noticed that the computer has access to her account.. 

bc of what I saw last time, I decided to open it. And what I saw completely shocked me.. I saw some semi n\*de pics of my own mother.. S\*x talk.. Calls.. Other stuff that I probably can't share here.. But it completely blew my mind.. I feel like I've been living a lie and what's worse is that my father last year left this country for us so that he could work hard.. do his best to provide for us.. And seeing those messages made me feel sick..

 Idk how to confront this.. or how  I could even share this to my siblings (We're siblings of 5.. Im one of the youngest) And I feel lost.. It's 3:30 AM and idk how I could sleep after seeing all that.. It's just disgusting.. What's worse is that I can't directly confront mom bc she could possibly die since she has heart problems and could have a heart attack from the pressure.. 

And I'm also scared bringing this up to anyone.. If I do, could I ruin the entire family?.. Will everyone hate me if I tell them? I love my mother.. But will everyone hate her too? I love my mom yes but this is just f\*cked.. Will I potentially be the one who would ruin my entire family? I feel lost..

"I can't be the only one who experiences this so I'm curious how everyone handles it.

My wife's best friend is coming to visit us for a week, and she's rich.  Old money rich.  That would be fine, but she also has the stereotypical ""well if poor people just worked harder, they'd be like me"" attitude.

She's never accomplished anything herself.  Bailed out of school after switching colleges four times.  Daddy paid her way.  She never worked.  Daddy gave her husband a job in the family biz making ~$150k right when they got married, despite him having no credentials, no identifiable skills at all in the field, along with six figures in cash for ""starter money"".  Husband's family is all millionaires, too.

She is constantly talking about the vacations she and her husband take, the things they're buying, all the research she's doing about what she wants to buy next.

But the part that gets me is the lecturing.  My house is always under construction because I can't afford interior designers for everything.  ""Why don't you just hire it out?""  When I say I can't afford it, it's ""well you should just tell your boss you need more money like my husband does!""  He wins every negotiation with his boss because her dad is the *owner*.

I'm not going to do anything off-putting like tell her off.  She wouldn't take the lesson from a peasant making $90k like me anyway, with my pre-owned cars and thrift store clothes and fixer-upper house.

"I’m the 31 year old father to my 6 year old boy. He’s always struggled with putting himself out there and making friends, he’s generally very shy and anxious and likes to keep to himself. 

He has trouble bonding with other boys his age because of his more gentle nature. He doesn’t like to roughhouse and cries easily, he prefers to cuddle and chat, or to play house. 

I’ve let go of the stereotypical gender roles and allow him to express himself how he wants, by wearing lots of purple (his favorite color) and we’ve been growing his hair out a bit.

Recently he came home from school crying asking me what an ‘F-slur’ (he said the full word) was. I was shocked to say the least since he never heard that word from me or his mom and asked him where he got that from. 
He said a boy in school called him that and a couple other boys joined in. 

I asked to speak to his teacher at drop off the next day and we have scheduled a meeting next week with the parents of the other kids involved. 
My boy is okay since he doesn’t grasp what a word like that means yet, but this has just made me so worried about the rest of his school years. 
I mean he is 6 for christ sake, I can’t imagine what his middle and high-school years are gonna entail.

I sat down at the dinner table and started doing a diamond painting to calm myself down while having my headphones on. My mum then approached me from behind, to walk through to the kitchen. Instead of just hugging me or doing literally anything else, she put my hair to the side and started popping a pimple on the back of my neck (I have bacne). I thought she was going to massage me or something, and it obviously hurt like hell, so I freaked out on her. She said something along the lines of ""but you're my child, am I not allowed to touch you?""  
  
I normally have a good relationship with my mum, but this is the only thing that's annoying me. I've tried to set boundaries and it's literally hopeless, she'll do stuff like putting small pieces of dandruff out of my hair IN PUBLIC. It's so incredibly embarrassing and humiliating to the point where I don't want to be around her anymore. Still, she's my mum, and I feel like I should work things out with her, but talking to her is like speaking to a wall; she'll always find a reason to blame ME for anything.  
  
How do I set a clear boundary and tell her that I'm not okay with what she's doing??","bugün okuldan eve geldim belli ki yorgunum çünkü trenle bir saat uzaklıktaki okula gidiyorum yemek masasına oturdum ve kendimi sakinleştirmek için elmas boyama yapmaya başladım kulaklıklarımı taktım annem arkamdan yanıma gelip mutfağa doğru yürüdü bana sarılmak veya başka bir şey yapmak yerine saçımı yana yatırdı ve boynumun arkasındaki sivilceyi patlatmaya başladı sivilcem var bana masaj yapacağını falan sandım ve belli ki çok canım yanıyor bu yüzden ona çok sinirlendim ama sen benim çocuğumsun sana dokunmama izin verilmiyor mu gibi bir şeyler söyledi


normalde annemle iyi bir ilişkim var ama beni sinirlendiren tek şey bu sınırlar koymaya çalıştım ve bu tam anlamıyla umutsuz bir durum saçımdan küçük kepek parçalarını halk içinde temizlemek gibi şeyler yapıyor bu inanılmaz derecede utanç verici ve aşağılayıcı bir durum artık onun etrafında olmak istemiyorum yine de o benim annem ve onunla işleri yoluna koymam gerektiğini düşünüyorum ama onunla konuşmak bir duvarla konuşmak gibi kabuk her zaman suçlayacak bir sebep buluyor bana her şey için


nasıl net bir sınır çizebilirim ve ona yaptığı şeyden memnun olmadığımı nasıl söyleyebilirim"
"Hope this is a good sub to post this, because I'm really looking for some advice and other view points. 

I (30f) just went into remission this past October after two years of fighting cancer. I don't want to go into too indepth or my treatments, but I went with the most aggressive approach possible when I found out. I was in and out of the hospital for two years, and got numerous organs removed. 

The entire time my friends were so supportive. checking on me and seeing if I needed things, playing games with me while I was bed ridden, sending me pet pictures to keep my moods up. I felt like there support got me through a lot. And that is where the big problem kinda happens now. 

After I went into remission, I was ghosted by the entire social circle. It was a group of 8 people. I was really confused and still am, but a friend who isn't as close to them but sometimes sees them said that he heard it was just too much for them to deal with my cancer, I was so needy, and they don't want to be around someone sick all the time.They decided to just stick it out till remission collectively and then not deal with me anymore because it was too stressful. 

I'm not sure how I feel about this. I feel like all their support was just out of pity or shallow obligations and it makes me feel weird. Like my appreciation is twisted.

I don't know if I should hate their guts for ghosting me now, or appreciate they at the very least helped me through all the tough times and move on with my life. This is two months later now and it's still bothering me.

I will add  I'm in therapy and she says it's important to focus on the future and make new friends but I wanted to see if anyone else had feelings, thoughts, or advice on this. 

Thank youuu

Edit : thank you guys for the much needed advice and it calmed my mind a lot. I think I'm going to proceed with sending a holiday card to the parties involved, with a small ""thanks for everything these past few years, and wishing you an amazing holiday"" and maybe a small coffee gift card. And then leave the ball in their court, either to give them the space they need or to see if I never hear from them again. I really appreciate all the different view points on this that my friends might of had and if anyone else comes to this post please let me know your thoughts too. ","umarım bunu yayınlamak için iyi bir alt başlıktır çünkü gerçekten bazı tavsiyeler ve diğer bakış açıları arıyorum

iki yıllık kanserle mücadeleden sonra bu ekim ayında remisyona girdiysem tedavilerime çok fazla girmek istemiyorum ama iki yıl boyunca hastaneye girip çıktığımı ve çok sayıda organımın çıkarıldığını öğrendiğimde mümkün olan en agresif yaklaşımı uyguladım

tüm bu süre boyunca arkadaşlarım beni desteklediler ve bir şeye ihtiyacım olup olmadığını kontrol ettiler, yataktayken benimle oyunlar oynadılar, ruh halimi yüksek tutmak için bana evcil hayvan resimleri gönderdiler, desteklerinin beni çok iyi idare ettiğini hissettim ve büyük sorun şu anda burada başlıyor

remisyona girdikten sonra tüm sosyal çevrem tarafından görmezden gelindim, bir grup insandı, gerçekten kafam karışıktı ve hala öyleyim ama onlara yakın olmayan ama bazen onları gören bir arkadaşım, kanserimle başa çıkmanın onlar için çok fazla olduğunu duyduğunu söyledi, çok muhtaçtım ve sürekli hasta birinin etrafında olmak istemiyorlardı, remisyona kadar topluca dayanmaya ve sonra uğraşmamaya karar verdiler artık benimle çünkü çok stresliydi

bu konuda ne hissettiğimden emin değilim, sanki tüm destekleri sadece acıma veya yüzeysel yükümlülüklerden kaynaklanıyormuş gibi hissediyorum ve bu takdirimin çarpıtılmış gibi garip hissetmeme neden oluyor

şimdi beni hayaletledikleri için onlara kızmalı mıyım yoksa en azından tüm zor zamanlarımda bana yardım edip hayatıma devam etmemi takdir etmeli miyim bilmiyorum, bundan iki ay sonra ve hala beni rahatsız ediyor

terapide olduğumu ve geleceğe odaklanmanın ve yeni arkadaşlar edinmenin önemli olduğunu söylediğini ekleyeceğim ama bu konuda başka birinin de duyguları, düşünceleri veya tavsiyeleri olup olmadığını görmek istedim

teşekkür ederim

"a few months ago my (20F) bf (20M) tried to record him fucking me from behind in secret. the only reason i knew is because i heard him grab his phone from the table next to the bed. i was frozen in fear and i didnt say anything, i just kind of let it happen and then after i heard him put his phone back i waited a few seconds and then asked to stop. i didnt say anything and pretended that i didnt know. i went through the whole day like normal and he didnt say anything about it. 

the next morning i asked to see his phone, and he unlocked it and gave it to me. i went straight to his camera roll and saw my bare asscheeks front and center when i opened the hidden folder. 

i guess i should mention that this was the 2nd time i ever had sex, and both times were with my bf. i was already super insecure ab my sexual identity and the first time we fucked it was insanely painful but he had kept asking and asking to try. the worst part is that, just a couple minutes before he took the video, he asked if i wanted to go doggy and i told him i didnt like doing it that way, but he insisted we try. this was the second time he had persisted in asking me to get on my knees like that, knowing i was hesitant. just for me to oblige and him to try to video. 

i will say, upon deleting the video it was only about 2 seconds long. when i returned his phone to him and confronted him, he just apologized and told me that it was such a short video because he realized that it was wrong. 

i forgave him at the time and grieved in silence. i felt disgusting in my body and the intrusive thoughts remembering how helpless and vulnerable i was in that moment kept coming back to haunt me. 

i brought it up again a few weeks later and asked him if it had anything to do with porn. prior to that conversation, he told me he hadnt watched porn in years. come to find out he has a porn addiction. for like 7+ years. 

so i told him he needs to quit and get help, which he did. he was in therapy for a while. but i was always so uncomfortable with the topic and remembering how it made me feel that i was always so nervous to ask about his progress. since then he has told me that he developed a different view on porn and it disgusts him now, so he no longer watches it. i just dont know if i believe this. he lied about his addiction before and i just dont think its so simple to quit like hes making it out to be. 

the whole thing still just feels weird. i dont know what to think. i feel like i never fully healed from what he did but i dont know how to get past it. how do i move forward from this?

tldr; my bf secretly recorded me during sex and later told me he was hiding a porn addiction. he got therapy and told me he has quit watching porn since then, but im not sure if i believe him. now im not sure how to move forward. 
","birkaç ay önce erkek arkadaşım gizlice arkamdan beni becerdiğini kaydetmeye çalıştı bunu bilmemin tek sebebi yatağın yanındaki masadan telefonunu aldığını duymamdı korkudan donup kalmıştım ve hiçbir şey söylemedim sadece olmasına izin verdim sonra telefonunu geri koyduğunu duyduktan sonra birkaç saniye bekledim ve sonra durmasını istedim hiçbir şey söylemedim ve bilmiyormuş gibi davrandım normal bir şekilde bütün gün geçirdim ve o hiçbir şey söylemedi 

ertesi sabah telefonunu görmek istedim ve kilidini açıp bana verdi doğrudan kamera rulosuna gittim ve gizli klasörü açtığımda çıplak göt yanaklarımı ön planda ve ortada gördüm 

sanırım bunun seks yaptığım ikinci sefer olduğunu ve her ikisinde de erkek arkadaşımla birlikteydim cinsel kimliğim konusunda zaten aşırı güvensizdim ve ilk seviştiğimizde inanılmaz acı vericiydi ama o sormaya ve denemek için sormaya devam etti en kötü yanı videoyu çekmeden birkaç dakika önce doggy seks yapmak isteyip istemediğimi sordu ve ben de ona hoşlanmadığımı söyledim bunu bu şekilde yapıyorum ama o ısrarla deneyelim dedi bu benim dizlerimin üzerine çökmemi istemekte ısrar ettiği ikinci seferdi, sadece benim itaat etmem ve onun video çekmeyi denemesi için tereddüt ettiğimi bilerek

videoyu sildiğimde sadece birkaç saniye sürdüğünü söyleyeceğim, telefonunu ona geri verdiğimde ve onunla yüzleştiğimde sadece özür diledi ve bunun çok kısa bir video olduğunu çünkü bunun yanlış olduğunu anladığını söyledi

o zaman onu affettim ve sessizce yas tuttum vücudumda iğrençlik hissettim ve o anda ne kadar çaresiz ve savunmasız olduğumu hatırlayan müdahaleci düşünceler beni rahatsız etmeye devam etti

birkaç hafta sonra tekrar gündeme getirdim ve ona bunun o konuşmadan önce pornoyla bir ilgisi olup olmadığını sordum bana yıllardır porno izlemediğini söyledi ve sonra yıllardır porno bağımlılığı olduğunu öğrendim

bu yüzden ona bırakması ve yardım alması gerektiğini söyledim ve öyle yaptı, bir süredir terapi görüyordu ama konu beni her zaman çok rahatsız ediyordu ve bunun bana hissettirdiklerini hatırladığımda her zaman bu konuda soru sormaktan çok gergindim o zamandan beri ilerlemesi bana pornoya karşı farklı bir bakış açısı geliştirdiğini ve artık bundan iğrendiğini söyledi bu yüzden artık izlemiyor buna inanıp inanmamamı bilmiyorum daha önce bağımlılığı hakkında yalan söyledi ve bırakmanın onun yaptığı gibi basit olduğunu düşünmüyorum

bütün olay hala garip geliyor ne düşüneceğimi bilmiyorum sanki yaptığı şeyden asla tam olarak iyileşmemişim gibi hissediyorum ama bunu nasıl aşacağımı bilmiyorum bundan nasıl ilerleyeceğim

kısa bir süre sonra erkek arkadaşım gizlice seks sırasında beni kayda aldı ve daha sonra bana porno bağımlılığını sakladığını söyledi terapi gördü ve o zamandan beri porno izlemeyi bıraktığını söyledi ama şimdi ona inanıp inanmamamı bilmiyorum nasıl ilerleyeceğimi bilmiyorum"
"I got married and I think it was the biggest mistake of my life. I’ll do my best not to make this too long. I 21 F and my husband 22 M got married last month. Last year, 6 days before our 6th anniversary he got in a drunk driving accident. The people he hit needed the jaws of life to be pried out of their car and then got life flighted to the nearest hospital. When it happened, I was an hour away and no one would tell me what was going on, I thought he was dead. I drove that hour preparing for the worst, for my life to change, and I was a wreck. When I finally got to his parents house I found out he was alive, in the hospital, but alive. He got out of the hospital, then jail a few days later. I thought I lost him and it was the worst thing I have ever experienced. When he got home I told him I didn’t feel any differently about us, I still wanted to get married and have a future together. So, a day or so later, on our anniversary he proposed, I said yes and we started planning the wedding. At that time I didn’t even realize how big his problem with alcohol was, he hid it so well. He promised me changes, sobriety, I believed it. Well, he’s not sober, he lies to me, he still drinks, I don’t trust him, and I don’t trust our future children with him. Now, I have so much hatred inside of me toward him. I hate that I can’t have alcohol in my house, that I feel guilty every time I drink with my friends, I hate feeling trapped in a marriage, I hate that he lies to me, I hate that I don’t trust him. I feel like I went from a fun happy care free person who had it all figured out to someone who is dying inside and nobody sees it. I love him, we’ve built a life together, but I truly don’t know if I can or even if I should ride this out. I need an outside perspective, there’s only a few people in my life who know about the accident but no one who I can talk to about all the aftermath. If people want a more in depth thing about the accident and everything that happened after I can write one. I just didn’t want to get roasted for making this too long.

"I 22y/o female have been married for 4 years with my 29 year old husband. Our relationship has been hectic but we have managed to stay together with all the love and all. Well I recently found out that 2 years ago he put one of his businesses under his baby mother's name and his. Which for me is unfair... Im the one who has been married to him, helped him grow his businesses. Well today I told him if he was going to put anything under my name since he's securing her future I think he should do the same to me who's actually been there for him.
He said he would definitely not put anything under my name and I honestly feel as if this might cause the end of our relationship. Any advice?

**update** 
So I did a background check on both of them and turns out that he put 2 businesses under her name one in 2021 and one in 2023 which was recent. For me it isn’t about economic solution because I have a very good job making 4k + a month. For me it’s that I feel like how come he didn’t consider me but has considered her. I’m the one who is with him, he’s supposed to care and appreciate me but in my eyes he’s not. It’s not fair to me that he’s putting all this stuff under her name and I’m here painted on the wall. Especially now that I know it’s 2 businesses and not 1…

I’m frustrated and hurt, especially since I’ve always been supportive of them in the past and have helped them with their projects. No one else in the team seemed aware of the real origin of the idea until I spoke up.

"My friend was diagnosed a couple years ago with autism.  She's very high functioning but it was definitely for the best because with that on record teachers are more understanding.  However, I think she's been trying to change to become ""more autistic"" if that makes sense?

I've known her since diapers and she always had ADHD and OCD but otherwise she behaved just like everybody else.  When she got the diagnosis, which she asked for, she started changing.

Whenever teachers used to do that thing where they give you a hint if you ask a question, she would take the hint and almost always figure it out.  Now if they give a hint she sits in her chair and won't do anything until they come back, and tell them that because she's autistic she can't be expected to figure things out on her own.

She also gets into more arguments about smaller things, and once argued something that was factually incorrect.  When I showed her the facts she said ""I won't forget this about you"" and then later apologized and said, ""I'm autistic, we have this thing where we defend our opinions very strongly"".

She used to be somewhat adventerous with food, there were definitely certain textures and consistencies she couldn't eat, but since the diagnosis she's stopped eating foods she liked and has only eaten ""autism foods"" as she says like mac n' cheese, chicken nuggets, etc.

All of her hopes and ambitions went right out the window too, and she says that she wants to live in her parent's basement as long as she can so she doesn't have to work because she's autistic.  When she said that to me I was trying to be supportive and I said that she shouldn't let autism decide her life because she's more than her diagnosis, but she disagreed with me and said that she's autistic and there's nothing she can do.

I really want to know if this is something that can be helped and she can get her ambition back or if I'm actually not being supportive.

Edit:  Thanks to everybody who replied, I didn't know what unmasking was until now and I looked into it a bit and it's interesting!  To the people offering therapy I'll mention it to her.  People are also saying to give her time and I'll do that too.  Thanks everybody.","arkadaşım birkaç yıl önce otizm teşhisi aldı, çok işlevli ama bu kesinlikle en iyisiydi çünkü kayıtlara göre öğretmenler daha anlayışlı ancak bence o daha otistik olmak için değişmeye çalışıyor, eğer mantıklı geliyorsa

öğretmenler bir soru sorduğunuzda size ipucu verdiklerinde ipucu alır ve neredeyse her zaman anlardı şimdi ipucu verdiklerinde sandalyesine oturur ve geri gelip otistik olduğu için kendi başına bir şeyler anlamasının beklenemeyeceğini söyleyene kadar hiçbir şey yapmaz

ayrıca daha küçük şeyler hakkında daha fazla tartışmaya girer ve bir keresinde olgusal olarak yanlış bir şey savundu, ona gerçekleri gösterdiğimde bunu asla unutmayacağımı söyledi ve sonra özür diledi ve otizmli olduğumu söyledi, fikirlerimizi çok güçlü bir şekilde savunduğumuz bir şey var

yemek konusunda biraz maceracıydı kesinlikle belli dokular ve kıvamlar yiyemiyordu ama teşhis konulduğundan beri sevdiği yiyecekleri yemeyi bıraktı ve sadece otizmli yiyecekleri yedi, dediğine göre makarna ve peynir tavuk nugget'ları gibi

"My husband and I are typically very sexual people. We are very open with each others bodies, and we send nudes to each other somewhat often, so to have nudes in his phone is not completely taboo. 
Our sex life hasn’t been as exciting lately as much as it was/could be; im 1 week short of being 5 months pregnant. we still have sex but just not as often or as crazy as before. 
Given that information, I have found in his phone that lately he’s taken an interest to half naked girls online (by looking at his liked posts), and I try not to get jealous because after all these girls were unrealistic Instagram baddies, and I’m here for them and their content, it just makes me a little uncomfortable when it’s my husband who’s interested in looking at them. I brushed it off of my shoulder, but I did discuss to him that even tho they were “famous” it still made me a bit uncomfortable and well insecure. 
Even after having this talk with him, I would still find that he has continued to take interest in looking at such posts/photos/videos. 
Tonight, I just decided that I wanted to look at his phone, my curiosity often times leaves me feeling insecure, but at least I know he’s not cheating on me right? 
I decided this time to go to his photo gallery, and long story short since I’ve been babbling this whole post already— I saw he had a “hidden” album, so I went to it and unlocked it via his passcode. In it concluded nudes we had exchanged over time, but I noticed that very recently he had taken some of his own that I did not receive from him. How should I feel about this??? Is this harmless or the start to something bad??
They are about a month old, and there’s only a few of them. 
I guess what I’m asking, does this sound like a red flag? Does this seem like something I’m going to have to worry about and think on?

"As stated in the title, my (step) daughter, Savannah, wants to put my last name on her jersey. I'm going to do my best to explain my internal struggle without it getting too confusing.

(A little backstory and the sake of anonymity the names are changed. I don't use the word ""step"" as I've known Savannah since she was 2 and I consider her my daughter. I'm only using it for distinguishing purposes.)

My wife and I have been together for 7 years. I met her when she was legally separated. This is the second marriage for both of us. I brought 3 kids into this marriage and she brought 1. We also have 1 together. I was previously married for 13 years and it was an ugly divorce, she got into drugs and alcohol and drove us into financial hell and all the other fun things that come with addiction. I got sole custody of the kids at the beginning and it has since changed to 50/50. She was married for 7 years to Steve and the divorce was very amicable. They divorced due to his spending addiction on material things (think $700 Gucci pants) and drove them into financial hell. My wife and I did the whole long distance dating thing for a few years and then her and her daughter moved out of state to be with me. Steve didn't put up a fight and was fine with his daughter leaving. My wife did not request any child support as we both make great money, however anything to do with sports, school and medical - Steve is responsible for 100%. And let's be honest, it's less than $1,500 a year. I want to emphasize that we have a great relationship with Steve and his new wife, Sara. When they come out to visit, they stay with us. We all get along great. They buy birthday and Christmas gifts for my kids, they come out for birthday parties. I do believe he is not a good father, but he isn't a bad guy if that makes sense? He would rather go on vacations with his new wife than spend time with his daughter. He will tell her that he can't take her because he has to work, and then the next day he's posting his vacation on Instagram. Which is fine, I'm here and present. I attend all her softball games, take on the father role and take care of all her financial needs. We are very lucky as the mixed family situation is damn near perfect. She has her brother and sisters here. It's not like she doesn't have a dad.

Last night at softball tryouts they get to pick the names on the back their jersey. Some kids do nicknames, some do last names. Savannah has always done a nickname. Her older sister (my daughter) plays as well and decided to go with her last name. Savannah then asked if she can put my last name on her jersey (Parent win for sure.) Do I have an obligation to talk to Steve about this? I'm not going to make her talk to her father about it, she's only 10. I'm beyond happy and over joyed about it, but I'm kind of also worried about ruining a relationship with him. I'm not here to replace him (even though that's exactly what I am doing, due to his negligence)  At the end of the day I just want to make sure I am doing the right thing.

-----UPDATE

Good morning everyone! Just wanted to provide a little more information that may help with a bunch of the comments and questions that are coming in.

For the people asking would he even see it? Probably not, but we are both active on social media and constantly posting about the kids sports. Steve and Sara both follow us and the kids that have social media. Savannah also facetimes weekly with them. So there is a chance of him learning about it over the phone or via social media. They have been to games, but only a couple in several seasons. So the chances are low, but I definitely didn't want him to find out about it live at a game. Just seemed like it would be heart breaking and awkward at the same time.

We did ask Savannah that evening if she wanted to change her last name officially and she said no. We didn't ask for any reasoning as to why not. And I believe, even if she wanted to, I would talk her out of it or kick the can until she got older. I wouldn't tell her this, but I believe 10 is too young to make those decisions, and I wouldn't want it to bite me down the line if she felt any pressure to do it. If she kept insisting we would have the conversations and approach it with her accordingly, but that's a conversation with you all if it ever comes to that. If she feels that is the last connection to her bio dad, I'm ok with it and fully support it. My bio dad was a horrible person the second half of my life before he passed, yet I still hold him high with the memories of the first half of my life. We do weird things when it comes to our parents, and I'm ok with it. If she chooses to, or doesn't, will not change my love and support for her.

What does my wife say about this? It happened on the car ride home from tryouts. We asked Savannah what name she wanted on the back, she said she wanted my last name. My wife looked at me and gave me a proud smile. Savannah was basically told whatever she wants. We didn't dive much more into it than that. Tryouts ended at 9p and I get up at 3a for work. At the time of her statement, I was buzzing inside and didn't even think about talking to Steve regarding the name on her jersey. It was something that I woke up thinking about, and because no one else was awake in my household, I came to you all to get an unbiased POV. Yesterday, I worked a 12 hour shift and then we took all the kids to a local NFL team's open practice for the kids to get autographs, grabbed a bite to eat and headed home where we got the kids ready for bed, and I promptly hit the sack. I didn't want to talk about it in front of the kids, however, we did talk about the name a little at dinner. It sounds like my daughter, Savannah, wants to go with the hyphenated version on her jersey. All her siblings are for it, and so are we. As for letting Steve know about this, my wife seems to care about letting Steve know about as much as Steve cares about being in Savannah's life. So that being said, I intend on just letting the cards fall where they will. For me this was more about doing the right thing, what I would want done for me. I put myself in Steve's shoes for a moment. But the more I read your responses, and the more I thought about it, I would never be in his position. You see, as much as I want to sell my kids to the lowest bidder on a daily basis, I would move mountains for them. My job is stressful, long, odd hours, but I still manage to make all their games (usually manning the BBQ for snack shack) and if I have to miss anything of theirs, I sometimes will give up going to a practice. I start my days early, that way if it turns out to be a long day, I can still make games. Also whether she is doing this as a tip of the ol' softball cap to me or she is doing it to bond with her sister, it's still a parent win for my wife and myself. We're obviously doing something right.

So for all you that responded, thank you. I appreciate anyone who took the time out of their day to offer words of advice and encouragement to some random dude that probably over thought a situation.","as stated in the title my step daughter savannah wants to put my last name on her jersey im going to do my best to explain my internal struggle without it getting too confusing

"it was my birthday on the 18th. a day before, i get an instagram dm from a random girl. i don’t know who she is so i asked my bf (we go to different unis so it’s possible he could’ve known her) and then he responds that he’s done something really bad. i never really had trust issues, but i knew he cheated. so he runs through the story, says his mates were making fun out of him, saying he can’t pull, so then he goes on the dating app we originally met up on and starts flirting with this girl to prove to his friends that he can pull. his excuse for not telling me was because i was asleep and i would’ve never agreed to let him do that. the girl runs through the story. it’s totally different. she says that he’s calling himself a whole other name and that he’s changed his age (he’s 19). my bf then admits that he does actually have a gf but he doesn’t show me to this girl, rather his ex. the girl is obviously not pleased so she does some digging and ends up finding me. then she relays the story. 

my bf says it’s not really cheating because he didn’t have any intentions of carrying it on, he just wanted to prove to his friends he could bag a girl and then block her on everything. i went totally ballistic because i couldn’t believe he cheated on me a day before my birthday. he keeps telling me that it’s not cheating and it’s makes me feel really invalid for no longer being able to trust him. 

i’ve been arguing with him nonstop too about a friend i’ve made him block. he seemed pretty pissed that i’d assume he would cheat on me again but in my defense, i couldn’t trust him around a girl who is his type. even when i ask for reassurance he doesn’t take me serious and doesn’t reassure me so i just ignore him until i feel better. 

i have hated this entire week. it’s been full of arguments and resentment and it’s so hard to trust him again. any advice on how to regulate my emotions and to trust him again?","Doğum günümden bir gün önce rastgele bir kızdan instagram'dan DM aldım, kim olduğunu bilmiyordum, bu yüzden erkek arkadaşıma farklı üniversitelere gittiğimizi sordum, bu yüzden onu tanıyor olabilir ve sonra çok kötü bir şey yaptığını söyledi, aslında hiç güven sorunum olmadı ama aldattığını biliyordum, bu yüzden hikayeyi anlattı, arkadaşlarının onunla dalga geçtiğini ve çekemediğini söyledi, sonra ilk tanıştığımız flört uygulamasına girdi ve arkadaşlarına çekebileceğini kanıtlamak için bir kızla flört etmeye başladı, bana söylememesinin bahanesi uyuyor olmamdı ve bunu yapmasına asla izin vermezdim, kız hikayeyi anlattı, tamamen farklı, kendine bambaşka bir isim taktığını ve yaşını değiştirdiğini söyledi, o benim erkek arkadaşım, sonra aslında bir kız arkadaşı olduğunu ama beni bu kıza değil eski sevgilisine gösterdiğini itiraf etti, kız belli ki bundan memnun değil, bu yüzden biraz araştırma yapıyor ve sonunda beni buluyor, sonra hikayeyi anlatıyor

erkek arkadaşım aslında aldatmadığını çünkü hiçbir niyeti olmadığını söylüyor devam ettirmek için sadece arkadaşlarına bir kızla yatabileceğini ve sonra onu her yerde engelleyebileceğini kanıtlamak istiyordu, tamamen çılgına döndüm çünkü doğum günümden bir gün önce beni aldattığına inanamıyordum, bana bunun aldatma olmadığını ve artık ona güvenemediğim için kendimi gerçekten geçersiz hissettirdiğini söylüyordu

ben de bir arkadaşım hakkında onunla durmadan tartışıyordum, onu engelledim, beni tekrar aldatacağını varsaydığım için oldukça sinirli görünüyordu ama savunmam için, onun tipi olan bir kızın etrafında ona güvenemedim, güvence istediğimde bile beni ciddiye almıyor ve bana güvence vermiyor, bu yüzden kendimi daha iyi hissedene kadar onu görmezden geliyorum

One thing I want to do for her, however, my friend made fun of me for, and said she likely wouldn't read it. I am a writer. I love to write, and she is my muse. A lot of my writing, since meeting her, has revolved around her. She keeps and reads ever letter I write, and even hangs some up. I constantly write for her, and unfortunately I overthink my writing a lot. My friend (Male) , asked what I was writing one day. I told him ""I'm writing one-hundred reasons why I love her, each reason being a paragraph (ONLY 4-6 sentences for each paragraph)."" He replied ""That's cringe. I know you love writing, but how do you know she loves reading?"" He kept going on about how it was dumb, and cringe. So, Reddit, is this a bad idea? I've only written about eleven paragraphs- which took about twenty minutes- so I could just stop, but haven't written since the other day, and I'd like to know if it's worth it.

"I 30f recently found out I am pregnant and we (my husband 36m) and I are seriously considering having an abortion but the decision is really killing us. 
The reasons being we are soon to move into our very first house with our 2 kids 6 year old male and 6 month old female. Financially it would cripple us as I am the main bread winner and would likely have to put off many projects we had planned for our new home maybe even lose our home all together.
My pregnancy with my daughter was awful as I had hyperemesis which had me in and out of hospital and un able to work for a decent amount of my pregnancy 
While that all weighs pretty heavily on our minds we love our children so much and always dreamed of a big family which we weren't sure we were ever going to have due to my endometriosis and pcos 

So Reddit what should we do? 


UPDATE: Should I get an abortion? 

Sorry I cannot link the oh post please go to my profile if you need it 

First thankyou to those who were sympathetic to my predicament and those who shared their stories I know this isn't the place to ask this but I was truly struggling and needed to hear what was said. For those who were making hate filled comments I do hope you never have to make a decision like this and if you do I hope you're met with much more care than you showed me. 

Sorry if this is long, definitely not a post I thought I'd be updating but it's a story definitely worth telling 

So after a lot of talks, days spent throwing up and unable to move from the couch and wishing it was over to days spent wishing we were in a better spot so we could have that big family we ultimately decided to go ahead with the termination. I went to the GP who was amazing very sympathetic and kind she was my dr for my pregnancy with my daughter so she knew how much I suffered and my history. She fast tracked the tests as I made it clear I would only go ahead if it were a medical termination (just taking a pill) instead of the surgical version and she understood. 

One of the test was an ultrasound to be sure the pregnancy wasn't ectopic I went back to her the next day for results and she said something had been flagged by the radiologist on my left ovary it's small but worth investigating because it wasn't there all of a year ago when I went for scans for my daughter. The GP forwarded and followed up with a gynaecologist colleague and they had me in for blood work the next day. That afternoon I got a call from the gynae to say I needed to see her asap so we can discuss what is going on. She seen me in her lunch break and explained while she hopes the lesion is benign there's a chance of it being malignant and she would like to remove the ovary and biopsy the lesion. 
4 days after I had the test results I was in surgery having my ovary removed. I'm home after 2 days of recovery and not long ago got the call to say it was infact cancerous very early stages but quickly developing next steps are to have a follow up scan and blood work in 6 months to be sure of no reoccurance. Without the pregnancy I may have never known it was there I feel as if the universe blessed me while I'm sad we will never meet my little saviour we are so eternally grateful for it with out it I may not even be around to see their brother and sister grow 

I'm so lucky to have such an amazing medical team and family who have abs are supporting me now

testlerden biri gebeliğin ektopik olmadığından emin olmak için ultrasondu ertesi gün sonuçları almak için ona geri döndüm ve bir şeylerin olduğunu söyledi sol yumurtalığım radyolog tarafından işaretlendi, küçük ama araştırmaya değer çünkü orada değildi, bir yıl önce kızım için taramalar yaptırmaya gittiğimde aile hekimi bunu bir jinekolog meslektaşına iletti ve takip etti ve beni ertesi gün kan testi için çağırdılar, o öğleden sonra jinekologdan bir telefon aldım, onu en kısa sürede görmem gerektiğini ve neler olduğunu konuşabileceğimizi söyledi, beni öğle tatilinde gördü ve lezyonun iyi huylu olmasını umduğunu ancak kötü huylu olma ihtimalinin de olduğunu ve yumurtalığı çıkarmak ve lezyondan biyopsi yapmak istediğini söyledi
test sonuçlarımı aldıktan birkaç gün sonra ameliyata girdim, yumurtalığım alındı, günlerce iyileştikten sonra evdeyim ve kısa bir süre önce aslında kanserli olduğunu söyleyen bir çağrı aldım, çok erken evrelerdeydi ama hızla gelişiyordu, bir sonraki adımlar, hamilelik olmadan tekrarlamaması için aylar sonra bir takip taraması ve kan testi yaptırmak, orada olduğunu hiç bilemeyebilirdim, sanki evren beni kutsamış gibi hissediyorum, küçük kurtarıcımla asla tanışamayacağız, çok üzgünüz, bunun için sonsuza dek minnettarım, onsuz kardeşlerinin büyümesini göremeyebilirdim bile

"My best friend of 10 years has been with this guy for 5 of those years - she’s always saying she’s going to leave him but he always weasels his way back in. They’re both well educated and come from good backgrounds but I feel like she’s so much better than him and he makes her feel inferior because his family has money.

In 5 years he has:

1. Refused to call her his gf for the first two years b/c she has tattoos and his family wouldn’t approve.
2. Refuse to move in with her until he was ready despite staying at her house and eating her food for free.
3. Told her he doesn’t love her and never wants to marry her many many times. 
4. Proposes to her the following year.
5. Physically assaulted her twice. This last time he broke a bone on her and trashed the house. 
6. Randomly disappears from the house for hours and doesn’t tell her where he’s going but she has to tell him where she goes.
7. A few months ago he said he “accidentally” watched illegal 🌽 and was paranoid the police were after him and threw his phone away, got a new phone and wiped all his apps without her seeing what happened. (Stupid, I know, info stays in the cloud.)
8. Her dream in life is to have a kid and he has repeatedly told her he doesn’t find her mother material and won’t have a kid with her until HE’S ready.

Long story short, I cannot stand this boy. I accepted to be maid of honor because he was making a turn for the better but then numbers 5-8 happened. She always says she’s calling off the wedding then randomly sends me more wedding to dos. I can’t stomach being around him.

What do I do?!? 

EDIT: I forgot number 9! He tells her that instead of talking to me or visiting her mom or going to exercise classes or putting in overtime she should be giving him blowjobs!

"I know.. WILD caption, but (18M) I have always enjoyed wearing thin clothing because I have a decent lean build and I guess I’m proud of it or whatever, but recently I’ve become really insecure about my nipples poking through my shirt. People have pointed it out to me so many times recently (which they shouldn’t be doing I feel like, it’s kind of rude) even when I’m wearing black shirts it’s visible. I feel uncomfortable wearing thin shirts but I really don’t want to be. Any advice?","vahşi bir başlık biliyorum ama her zaman ince giysiler giymekten hoşlanmışımdır çünkü düzgün bir zayıf yapım var ve sanırım bununla gurur duyuyorum ya da neyse ama son zamanlarda gömleğimin içinden meme uçlarımın çıkması konusunda gerçekten güvensiz olmaya başladım. İnsanlar bunu bana son zamanlarda çok fazla söyledi, yapmamaları gerekirdi. Bunun biraz kaba olduğunu düşünüyorum, siyah gömlek giydiğimde bile belli oluyor. İnce gömlekler giymekten rahatsız oluyorum ama gerçekten tavsiyede bulunmak istemiyorum."
"Urgh. OK. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I met up with a friend I went to college with, he came to see me when he finished work. He's tried it on with me a few times. I've always said no, but for some reason today I didn't. 

I told him that I didn't have any experience and I was scared, but he said he would look after me and that he had been with virgins before and knew what he was doing.

I just said please be gentle, but the next thing I knew he had pushed me backwards on the sofa and was on top of me. I kind of froze and then he put it in and it hurt so much I went dizzy and threw up. 

I know the first time is normally painful, but is it normally that bad? Do I just have a really low pain threshold or something? 

After I threw up he just carried on going for what felt like ages then when he was done he left. So maybe it is normal because he didn't seem bothered. 

Im so sore now though, and I know some virgins bleed on their first time, but how much? Is it like a heavy period type amount? 

Im so confused right now and I don't know if this is normal or if I'm over reacting?

EDIT -

Thank you to everyone who responded and was so kind. I Iive with my sisters best friend, after med school she got a job in the same city as my uni and had a spare room, so I moved in with her. She was on a night shift last night but when she got home she pretty much guessed what had happened and took me to the hospital. It's all been completely crazy and I don't quite know how to feel. I still feel like it's partly my fault for saying yes. They wanted me to stay at the hospital but I just wanted to get home. I'm in bed now and it's all just kind of catching up to me.

EDIT -

I've recieved some really helpful comments and messages from some of you, and I'm really grateful. I'm still in alot of pain physically, but some of the weird fuzziness in my head is beginning to lift, and my emotions don't seem my own. I know that alot of you are saying that what happened to me was rape. I don't know how I feel about that. But I do know that I feel hurt, betrayed and used, like I'm now some dirty leftovers no one is ever going to want to touch. The minute he hurt me, every little thing about me changed forever, and I no longer recognise myself. ","urgh tamam açık sebeplerden dolayı at gitsin

üniversiteye gittiğim bir arkadaşımla buluştum, işini bitirince beni görmeye geldi, birkaç kez benimle denedi, her zaman hayır dedim ama bugün nedense yapmadım

ona hiç deneyimim olmadığını ve korktuğumu söyledim ama bana bakacağını ve daha önce bakirelerle birlikte olduğunu ve ne yaptığını bildiğini söyledi

sadece lütfen nazik ol dedim ama bir sonraki şey beni kanepede geriye doğru itti ve üstümdeydi, biraz dondum ve sonra onu soktu ve çok acıdı, başım döndü ve kustum

ilk seferin normalde ağrılı olduğunu biliyorum ama normalde bu kadar kötü mü sadece gerçekten çok düşük bir ağrı eşiğim mi var yoksa bir şey mi

kustuktan sonra sanki asırlar gibi hissettiren bir süre devam etti sonra bitirdiğinde gitti bu yüzden belki de normaldir çünkü rahatsız görünmüyordu

şimdi çok ağrım var ve bazı bakirelerin ilk seferlerinde kanadığını biliyorum ama ne kadar ağır bir adet kanaması gibi miktar

şu anda çok kafam karışık ve bunun normal olup olmadığını veya aşırı tepki verip vermediğimi bilmiyorum

"So Friday i was at a family gathering. My mom told me to go with my uncle to get stuff from the supermarket. On our way their we were talking about things and I he asked how my training was going I said good but... And I told him everything. He was shocked and furious at my parents. When we got back he baraded them in front of every one for treating this way and took me back to his house to stay the night he called the cops and explained the situation to them. He got arrested. I don't know for how long but I finally got rid of him. I still living with my parents but my uncle talked to them and they seem to be listening to me more. Finally I just wanna say thank you so so much for all the advice, love and support you really made me feel loved and heard. You cared about me wen no one did.

"Like the title says, my mom took my passport.

This is quite a ridiculous situation and it’s actually insane to me that family members are on her side… 

for context, i am 23 years old (turning 24 in a literal week), live in another city, pay my own rent, bills, etc, and my mother won’t give me my passport. 

the reason why she stole my passport was because she doesn’t want me going out of the country. this past year i’ve traveled to 7 countries, all on my dime. 

prior to this, i lived with her again for only a year, after my old college apartment lease was up. she told me i had til the summer to move out, which i did. 

my mother isn’t crazy, but this is control on a whole other level. her last bit of control. i just don’t understand why i can’t have something that’s rightfully mine? how do i approach this? i don’t want to have an argument. i just want my passport.","başlıkta da yazdığı gibi annem pasaportumu aldı

bu oldukça saçma bir durum ve aile üyelerinin onun tarafında olması benim için gerçekten çılgınca

bağlam için ben bir yaşındayım, kelimenin tam anlamıyla bir haftadır başka bir şehirde yaşıyorum, kendi kiramı ödüyorum, faturalarımı ödüyorum vs. ve annem bana pasaportumu vermiyor

pasaportumu çalmasının nedeni, geçen yıl ülke dışına çıkmamı istememesiydi, tüm paramı kendi cebimden ödeyerek ülkelere seyahat ettim

bundan önce, eski üniversite apartmanımın kirası bittikten sonra sadece bir yıl onunla yaşadım, yaza kadar taşınmam gerektiğini söyledi ve öyle de yaptım

annem deli değil ama bu bambaşka bir seviyede kontrol, onun son kontrolü, neden hakkım olan bir şeye sahip olamayacağımı anlamıyorum, buna nasıl yaklaşabilirim, tartışmak istemiyorum, sadece pasaportumu istiyorum"

"My (17) Parents (Dad 55, Mom 50) have always had a good relationship and a good marriage, almost too good. They are very open with their intimate life, in my opinion too open. Maybe i’m biased because i’m sure no kid wants to know about their parents private life. They’re the type to make out in the kitchen and i’m used to my dad grabbing my mom’s ass while telling ME how sexy he thought her body is. Why would you say this to a child, YOURE OWN CHILD. In the last 3 weeks is when i reached my breaking point. I have told my parents, especially my dad that i feel very uncomfortable with the way he acts and i don’t want to know anything about their intimate life because A, i’m their daughter so why should i know this?? and B, even if i wasn’t their daughter but some stranger - i didn’t ask so why tell me?? I’ve heard my parents at night in the past numerous times but never brought it up because it was after my bed time so that one’s kinda on me. They recently got this VW Camper where they put a mattress in there and they go places with it often. I know they use it to fuck but idc because i can’t hear them so it’s better for me. When i say in that car my dad immediately told me “if the walls could speak… they’d tell you freaky things” why would you tell me that. He also showed my a pic of my which she sent to him in short gym clothes posing for the camera. i asked him why he would show me that and he said that i was too “prude”. He always says this. Well today they fucked in the living room while i was in my room. They were incredibly loud so i screamed at them to stop. I screamed so loud and so often that my throat hurt and they simply didn’t stop. The feeling of having no control over the situation and just anger that they would do this in a shared space led to me having a panic attack. I was crying loudly so my parents came into my room. I have never been this angry in my life so i screamed at them asking them if they had absolutely no shame and what is wrong with them. They didn’t care and found it funny. It’s not cute or funny or charming, it’s is disgusting and inappropriate. They don’t take me seriously what do i do?? Am i really too prude and other parents are also like this?",annem babam annem her zaman iyi bir ilişkiye ve iyi bir evliliğe sahip olmuştur neredeyse fazla iyiler bence samimi hayatlarında çok açıklar fazla açık belki de ben taraflıyım çünkü eminim hiçbir çocuk anne babasının özel hayatını bilmek istemez onlar mutfakta öpüşen tiplerdir ve babamın annemin kıçını tutup bana onun vücudunun ne kadar seksi olduğunu söylemesine alışkınım bunu bir çocuğa neden söylersin ki kendi çocuğun son haftalarda kırılma noktama ulaştım anneme babama özellikle de babama onun davranış biçiminden çok rahatsız olduğumu söyledim ve samimi hayatları hakkında hiçbir şey bilmek istemiyorum çünkü a onların kızıyım o yüzden bunu neden bilmeliyim ve b onların kızı olmasam bile bir yabancı olsam bile sormadım o yüzden bana neden söylediler geçmişte geceleri anne babamı defalarca duydum ama hiç bahsetmediler çünkü benim yatma vaktimden sonraydı bu yüzden bu biraz benimle ilgili yakın zamanda bir vw kamp aracı aldılar içine bir şilte koydular ve onunla sık sık bir yerlere gidiyorlar biliyorum bunu sevişmek için kullanıyorlar ama umrumda değil çünkü onları duyamıyorum bu yüzden benim için daha iyi o arabada babamın bana hemen eğer duvarlar konuşabilseydi sana acayip şeyler söylerdi dediğini söyledim neden bana ayrıca bana kısa spor kıyafetlerimle kameraya poz verdiğim bir fotoğrafımı gösterdiğini söylüyorsun ona neden bunu bana gösterdiğini sordum ve çok muhafazakar olduğumu söyledi bunu her zaman söyler bugün oturma odasında seviştiler ben odamdayken inanılmaz gürültülüydüler bu yüzden onlara durmaları için bağırdım o kadar yüksek sesle ve o kadar sık ​​bağırdım ki boğazım ağrıdı ve onlar basitçe durmadılar durum üzerinde hiçbir kontrole sahip olmadığım hissi ve bunu ortak bir alanda yaptıkları için duyduğum öfke panik atak geçirmeme neden oldu yüksek sesle ağlıyordum bu yüzden annem ve babam odama geldi hayatımda hiç bu kadar sinirlenmemiştim bu yüzden onlara bağırdım onlara hiç utanmadıklarını ve ne sorunları olduğunu sordum umursamadılar ve komik buldular bu sevimli ya da komik ya da çekici değil iğrenç ve uygunsuz beni ciddiye almıyorlar ne yapmalıyım gerçekten çok muhafazakar mıyım ve diğer ebeveynler de böyle
"Hi, I’m 24F my boyfriend is 25M. We stay fairly close to eachother so this isn’t a long distance situation and we have been dating for 3 years . I have a job and my bf isn’t really set career wise he is still preparing for some exams so doesn’t have any strict schedule. He is free mostly and also has an excessively high libido ( I’m not sure actually but is wanting to have sex or online sexting  every alternate day considered high libido? Let me know about this as well ). I’m not the same in this regard, I don’t enjoy online sexting at all because it’s just me sending pics while he sits and jerks off. It’s exhausting for me and I don’t have any fun in this process. I still do it with him 90% of the times because I don’t want to disappoint him. And he is so so excited about it. Also in real life sex I am always on top and end up doing all the work so that isn’t too fun as well but it’s still better than online. Even when I just get a new dress and send him a pic of how it looks he ends up getting turned on and starts wanting to sext in that moment. I’m not free always to send pics for 30 mins or have the privacy always or just not In the mood ??. Sometimes I have meetings so I can’t go to his place. Whenever I say No to him ( I’ve only said it 4-5 times yet in a 3 year relationship) so imagine i don’t say no a lot, he gets so so offended. He starts telling me that I’m not attracted to him anymore or that im just over him??? Idk how to handle this is is very exhausting to keep doing something I hardly enjoy. Also worth mentioning is that he makes me do some really weird thjngs online like abusing him or smelling my own undergarments which I don’t enjoy at all and I have told him that many times. But he still insists that me abusing him turns him on. Also I’ve even told him that if he wants he can jerk off to porn so it won’t have to be such a pressure on me everyday and but he says he doesn’t wanna do it to porn and always wants it to be me 


Edit: I have been going through all the comments and I just want to thank everyone for really putting in time to help me through it. Mostly the people who didn’t judge me for being in such a bad situation but just understanding me  that sometimes people do get manipulated into staying in shitty situations hoping people will change.This is so private I can’t discuss it with any friends and I don’t even want to ruin his image in any way coz we share the same friend circles. ( something like this can really haunt you through your life ) but having all of you people give me all these perspectives really has helped me see things more clearly. A big huge thank you to all !! I am going to stand up for myself more and respect myself enough to take the right decision.","Merhaba, ben erkek arkadaşım m. Birbirimize oldukça yakınız bu yüzden uzun mesafeli bir durum değil ve yıllardır çıkıyoruz. Bir işim var ve erkek arkadaşım kariyer konusunda pek kararlı değil. Hala bazı sınavlara hazırlanıyor bu yüzden katı bir programı yok. Çoğunlukla boş ve ayrıca aşırı yüksek bir libidosu var. Aslında emin değilim ama her gün seks yapmak veya çevrimiçi seks yapmak istiyor. Bu yüksek libidolu olarak kabul ediliyor. Bunu da bana bildirin. Ben bu konuda aynı değilim. Çevrimiçi seks yapmaktan hiç hoşlanmıyorum çünkü sadece ben fotoğraf gönderiyorum ve o oturuyor ve mastürbasyon yapıyor. Bu benim için çok yorucu ve bu süreçte hiç eğlenmiyorum. Onu hayal kırıklığına uğratmak istemediğim için bazen onunla yapıyorum ve o da bundan çok ama çok heyecanlı. Gerçek hayatta sekste de her zaman üstteyim ve sonunda tüm işi ben yapıyorum bu yüzden bu da çok eğlenceli değil ama yine de çevrimiçinden daha iyi. Hatta yeni bir elbise aldığımda ve ona nasıl göründüğüne dair bir fotoğraf gönderdiğimde bile sonunda tahrik oluyor ve o anda seks yapmak istiyor. Her zaman fotoğraf göndermek için müsait değilim. dakikalarca ya da her zaman mahremiyete sahip olmak ya da sadece bazen ruh halim olmadığında toplantılarım oluyor bu yüzden ona hayır dediğimde evine gidemiyorum bunu sadece birkaç kez söyledim ama bir yıllık ilişkide bu yüzden çok fazla hayır demediğimi hayal edin o çok çok kırılıyor bana artık ona ilgi duymadığımı ya da onu atlattığımı söylemeye başlıyor bununla nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum çok yorucu neredeyse hiç hoşlanmadığım bir şeyi yapmaya devam etmek ayrıca bahsetmeye değer bir şey de bana çevrimiçi olarak gerçekten garip şeyler yaptırıyor, örneğin ona kötü davranmak ya da hiç hoşlanmadığım kendi iç çamaşırlarımı koklamak ve bunu ona birçok kez söyledim ama hala bana kötü davranmamın onu tahrik ettiğini söylüyor ayrıca ona isterse porno izleyerek mastürbasyon yapabileceğini söyledim böylece her gün üzerimde böyle bir baskı olması gerekmeyecek ama bunu porno izleyerek yapmak istemediğini ve her zaman benim yapmamı istediğini söylüyor

düzenle tüm yorumları okudum ve sadece bana yardım etmek için zaman ayıran herkese teşekkür etmek istiyorum çoğunlukla beni böyle kötü bir durumda olduğum için yargılamayan insanlara ama sadece beni anlamak, bazen insanların insanların değişmesini umarak kötü durumlarda kalmaya yönlendirildiğini gösteriyor, bu çok özel bir durum, bunu arkadaşlarımla konuşamıyorum ve hatta aynı arkadaş çevresini paylaştığımız için onun imajını da mahvetmek istemiyorum, böyle bir şey hayatınız boyunca sizi gerçekten rahatsız edebilir, ancak hepinizin bana tüm bu perspektifleri vermesi, olayları daha net görmemi sağladı, hepinize çok büyük bir teşekkür, kendimi daha fazla savunacağım ve doğru kararı almak için kendime yeterince saygı duyacağım"
"I'm an 11th grade math teacher, and I also take homeroom for a specific class.

There are about 18 kids in homeroom and about 20 in math. Anyway, one student in particular has been crying a lot lately, and on top of that he's been falling asleep during lessons

Usually he's pretty sad and withdrawn from everyone, but I've noticed an increase in that behavior these past few days. Talking to him when he's alone hasn't helped, because he doesn't open up

I do know a few things about him, though. He's been living with his cousin ever since he was 12 due to his parents being abusive and psychotic. I'm not sure why his cousin got custody of him, but I assume it wasn't my place to ask

He's also always dealt with mental issues, such as depression and PTSD. He seemed to be a bit more involved with everyone and everything for some time, but now he is back to shutting everyone out. I can't get him to complete assignments either

I'm not sure what I should do. I care about this kid a lot, but I don't know who to get involved due to the lack of parental care/support. Any advice? Is it even my place to do anything?

He's good friends with my daughter, who is also in my class. I would hate for something to happen","ben bir 2. sınıf matematik öğretmeniyim ve ayrıca belirli bir ders için sınıf öğretmeniyim

"6 years ago, I bought my house in a “rebuilding neighborhood.” It’s not the best, not the worst but I haven’t had too many issues here aside from a shitty next door neighbor. I’m a non threatening black guy, roughly 150lbs as I have cancer and drive a small smart car. Anyway, tonight, I go to the gas station a block away from my home. I was with a girl, she wanted to see if somebody up there would sell her weed. It seemed like a bad idea but I drove her up there anyway. We got up there, some dudes directed us to some dealers and she got her pot. 

While that was happening a guy walked up to my window and essentially tried to “hood check” me. He asked where I’m from, where I live, why I’m up there, what I’m doing. I gave vague answers that were mostly “What’s up” “What’s your problem?” And “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Told me, somebody like me shouldn’t be out that late in a place like that. Told me he’d give me a pass because we were the same color (black) and not to let him see me up there again. I sized him up but couldn’t tell whether or not he had a weapon on him. He also had approx. 6 other people standing nearby him. I kept my window mostly closed and had the discussion with him that way. I eventually just pulled off. He was fully threatening me though in a non-direct way.

I’m almost 30, work a regular job and own a house. You’re not going to tell me I can’t go to a gas station literally a block from my house bc I essentially don’t have a gang “permission slip.” I’ve been going there for years at this point. The only real reason he was able to speak to me in that way without me bucking back at him more aggressively is because I didn’t have my firearm on me. Since the incident, I have moved it back to my car again.

Where do I go from here? Should I just take the L and go to a further gas station? Should I just keep doing what I’m doing like nothing happened? I drove by the area a few hours later, the guy was crossing the street and turned and smiled/stared menacingly at me. Should I even care? I found the guy on FB using the nickname he identified himself as, he appears to be under 25, has a few pics of guns and does seem to live in the area as well. 



","yıllar önce yeniden yapılanan bir mahallede evimi satın aldım en iyisi değil en kötüsü değil ama burada berbat bir komşu dışında çok fazla sorun yaşamadım ben tehdit edici olmayan siyah bir adamım kanser olduğum için yaklaşık 10 kilo ağırlığındayım ve küçük bir smart araba kullanıyorum neyse bu gece evimden bir blok ötedeki benzin istasyonuna gidiyorum bir kızla birlikteydim orada birinin ona ot satıp satmayacağını görmek istiyordu kötü bir fikir gibi geldi ama yine de onu oraya götürdüm oraya gittik birkaç adam bizi bazı satıcılara yönlendirdi ve o otunu aldı

bu olurken bir adam pencereme geldi ve esasen beni kontrol etmeye çalıştı nereden olduğumu, nerede yaşadığımı, neden orada olduğumu ve ne yaptığımı sordu çoğunlukla ne haber, sorunun ne ve ne hakkında konuştuğunu bilmiyorum gibi belirsiz cevaplar verdim bana benim gibi birinin böyle bir yerde bu kadar geç saatlerde dışarıda olmaması gerektiğini söyledi bana aynı renk siyah olduğumuz için bana izin vereceğini ve beni orada bir daha görmesine izin vermeyeceğini söyledi onu süzdüm ama üzerinde silah olup olmadığını anlayamadım ayrıca yaklaşık diğer insanlar onun yakınında duruyordu penceremi çoğunlukla kapalı tuttum ve onunla bu şekilde konuştum sonunda beni tamamen tehdit ediyordu ama dolaylı bir şekilde

normal bir işte çalışıyorum ve bir evim var bana evimden tam bir blok ötede bir benzin istasyonuna gidemeyeceğimi söyleyemezsin çünkü esasen bir çete izin belgem yok yıllardır oraya gidiyorum bu noktada bana daha agresif bir şekilde karşılık vermeden benimle bu şekilde konuşabilmesinin tek gerçek nedeni olaydan beri silahımın yanımda olmamasıydı onu tekrar arabama taşıdım

"Just to preface, I've been straight in the past. Haven't had much love success in the past few years, so it's somewhat irrelevant. 

After meeting to hookup the first time, I was super into it and was making love to him, instead of fucking him. The next day, my entire perspective on love/sex shifted, and realize how much fulfilling loving a person, instead of how hot their body is. So after our first hookup, we exchanged numbers, start texting and calling each other ""baby"" and whatnot. 

We met again today, and fucked, and also got to know each other some more. I think we are officially ""dating"" now. 

I am both in love but also super conflicted. Coming out with this news in my family is extremely unacceptable. I don't see where this can go, if we have to be secretive about it. I really like him and he likes me. It's the first time in my life I feel loved. btw I'm in my mid 20s

Last time when I was in Japan, he casually calls one of his friends the n word. I needed to make sure what he really meant and he said something like this.

""[n word], you know, Kai Ceant??""

He says he wants to go New York, and he's got tickets, but I know if he says the n word, he's probably gonna get hurt. I'm scared for him, I tried telling him but no offence, he's kinda dumb and only said ""Yuh"" when I was talking to him.","Japonya'da bir animatör olduğum için bazen oraya gidiyorum, oradayken Kai Ceant ve diğer Amp üyelerini izlemeyi seven çevrimiçi arkadaşlarım var, geçen sefer Japonya'dayken, arkadaşlarından birine zenci diyordu, gerçekten ne demek istediğinden emin olmam gerekiyordu ve şöyle bir şey söyledi

n kelime, Kai Ceant'ı tanıyorsun

New York'a gitmek istediğini ve biletleri olduğunu söylüyor ama zenci diyorsa muhtemelen incineceğini biliyorum, onun için korkuyorum, ona söylemeye çalıştım ama kusura bakma, biraz aptal ve sadece onunla konuşurken ""yuh"" dedi"
"(Using a throwaway account) I do love parents and I am very grateful for them. I would say that I have a pretty good home life generally.

However, my entire life my dad keeps smacking my ass every day because he thinks it’s funny. Even when I was a little kid (like 5/6) he would see me lying in my stomach in bed reading a book and he would say “you’re just asking for it!” Or “your bum looks so smackable” and he would smack my ass. Even when I would walk around the house, he would do it randomly. (On average maybe 10 times a day)

Even when I was very a little kid he would smack my ass when bathing me and it hurt. I I don’t think he was doing it in an abusive way because he’s not a very angry person *most of the time* and we get along well and laugh lots etc. he just thought it was funny?

Even now that I’m older (15) he still does it- this morning he accidentally walked in on me not fully changed (but I had underwear on and a tshirt) and smacked my ass like 5 times repeatedly not that hard but it still hurt and it was embarrassing for me. I always tell him to stop and that I don’t like it and he says sorry but he never stops. My mum tells him to stop too but he doesn’t because he thinks it’s funny. Apparently he thinks “I’m asking for it at this point” which is strange because I dress very tomboyish and even if I wasn’t, that doesn’t mean I’m asking for it.

I’ve just had enough of it now and i don’t know what to do. If I tell someone they may think my dad is abusive and get him into trouble with authorities and I really don’t want that to happen. I’m sorry if I’m overreacting but I really want this to stop I hate it and it makes me feel dirty and embarrassed.

Edit: thank you for all your help, it really means a lot to me. I have tried talking with my mum privately and in front of my dad many times about this and how I want it to stop. I shout at my dad when he smacks me. My mum usually says something along the lines (to my dad)
“honey, she doesn’t like it so stop smacking her, it’s not right at the age she is, you have to stop” to this, he says “okay. Sorry” but doesn’t really listen. It seems as if my mum doesn’t know what to do anymore. She has a few stern words with my dad any time she sees him smacking me after she has time to sit down and talk but then he says he can’t remember doing so to which my mum reiterates that he definitely did. I talk about this so often with her but now she says she doesn’t now what to say anymore and that shes done talking about this.","tek kullanımlık bir hesap kullanıyorum ebeveynleri seviyorum ve onlara minnettarım genel olarak oldukça iyi bir aile hayatım olduğunu söyleyebilirim

ancak tüm hayatım boyunca babam her gün kıçıma şaplak atmaya devam etti çünkü bunu komik buluyordu, hatta küçük bir çocukken bile beni yatakta karnımın üstünde kitap okurken görürdü ve sen sadece bunu istiyorsun ya da popon çok şaplaklanabilir görünüyor derdi ve evde dolaşırken bile kıçıma şaplak atardı bunu ortalama günde belki birkaç kez yapardı

çok küçük bir çocukken bile beni yıkarken kıçıma şaplak atardı ve bu acı verirdi bunu kötü amaçlı yaptığını düşünmüyorum çünkü çoğu zaman çok sinirli biri değildir ve iyi geçiniriz ve çok güleriz vs. sadece komik olduğunu düşünürdü

şimdi bile büyüdüm ve hala yapıyor bu sabah yanlışlıkla beni bastı, tamamen değişmemiştim ama üzerimde iç çamaşırı ve bir tişört vardı ve kıçıma şaplak attı defalarca tekrar tekrar çok zor değildi ama yine de acı veriyordu ve benim için utanç vericiydi ona durmasını ve bundan hoşlanmadığımı her zaman söylüyorum ve özür diliyor ama asla durmuyor annem de durmasını söylüyor ama durmuyor çünkü bunun komik olduğunu düşünüyor görünüşe göre bu noktada bunu istediğimi düşünüyor ki bu garip çünkü çok erkek fatma gibi giyiniyorum ve öyle olmasam bile bunu istediğim anlamına gelmiyor

artık yeter artık ve birine söylersem ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum babamın tacizci olduğunu düşünebilir ve yetkililerle başını derde sokabilir ve bunun olmasını gerçekten istemiyorum aşırı tepki veriyorsam özür dilerim ama bunun gerçekten durmasını istiyorum bundan nefret ediyorum ve bu beni kirli ve utanmış hissettiriyor

edit yardımın için teşekkür ederim bu benim için gerçekten çok şey ifade ediyor annemle ve babamın önünde bunu ve bunun nasıl durmasını istediğimi defalarca konuşmaya çalıştım babam bana tokat attığında ona bağırıyorum annem genelde babama benzer şeyler söylüyor
tatlım bundan hoşlanmıyor o yüzden onu tokatlamayı bırak bu onun yaşı için doğru değil buna durmalısın tamam özür dilerim ama Gerçekten dinlemiyor, sanki annem artık ne yapacağını bilmiyormuş gibi, babamın bana vurduğunu gördüğünde oturup konuşmaya vakit bulduktan sonra ona birkaç sert söz söylüyor ama sonra babam bunu hatırlayamadığını söylüyor, annem kesinlikle yaptığını tekrarlıyor. Bunu onunla çok sık konuştum ama şimdi ne söyleyeceğini bilmediğini ve artık bu konuda konuşmayı bıraktığını söylüyor."
"So a guy and I connected really well cause we had the same humor and other similarities.
He was super nice like always cooking for me and stuff, until it started to feel like love bombing and he always wanted more and more physical contact whether it was just cuddling or something more.
Like it progressed from just a hug to wanting more and more.
He once even said maybe if our parents meet we can fuck. Cause he knew I want something serious.

I told him that I don’t trust him and that I think he just wants me for the physical aspect.
To which he said, you make me mad cause I put so much effort into this and you still think I’m just fooling you.
“If I really wanted to take advantage you I would have just raped you and that’s it. Instead of doing all of this”.

Is this a justifiable thing to say?

Edit: I already cut the contact with him. But since he always told me you’re crazy or that I’m being too paranoid for no reason, it’s nice to hear other peoples opinions as well for reassurance to know I’m not the only one who reacted strongly to his behavior.
Cause at one point I even questioned myself but I knew if I was truly crazy I would have felt “paranoid” towards everyone ","yani bir adamla gerçekten iyi anlaştık çünkü aynı mizah anlayışına ve diğer benzerliklere sahiptik
o çok nazikti, bana her zaman yemek pişiriyordu ve aşk bombası gibi hissettirmeye başlayana kadar ve her zaman daha fazla fiziksel temas istiyordu, ister sadece sarılmak ister daha fazlası olsun
sadece bir sarılmadan daha fazlasını istemeye doğru ilerledi
hatta bir keresinde belki ebeveynlerimiz tanışırsa sevişebiliriz dedi çünkü ciddi bir şey istediğimi biliyordu

ona güvenmediğimi ve sanırım beni sadece fiziksel yönüm için istediğini söyledim
ve bana çok fazla çaba sarf ettiğim için beni delirtiyorsun dedi ve hala seni kandırdığımı düşünüyorsun
eğer seni gerçekten istismar etmek isteseydim seni tecavüz ederdim ve hepsi bu kadardı bunun yerine

bunun söylenmesi haklı bir şey mi

düzenle zaten onunla iletişimi kestim ama bana her zaman deli olduğunu veya sebepsiz yere çok paranoyak olduğumu söylediği için diğer insanların fikirlerini duymak da iyi, davranışlarına sert tepki veren tek kişinin ben olmadığımı bilmenin verdiği güvence için
çünkü bir noktada ben Kendimi sorguladım bile ama eğer gerçekten deli olsaydım herkese karşı paranoyak hissedeceğimi biliyordum"

My wife is unable to invite her family due to most of them being halfway across the country. the night before the wedding, shes crying and wanting to call off the wedding because my mom invited my whole family. we end up going through with the wedding and everything is fine. throughout the next year the conversation of my mom inviting my whole family keeps coming up and it turns into a huge argument. finally today we have this conversation again and she asks me, ""How could you ever let that happen."" and then tells me that her family hates her because of what my mom did.

On my first day there she brought me over to her computer to the website she gets the uniforms on she asked what size jacket and shirt I need.

 I told her ""in jackets I usually prefer to get a medium as i like baggy jackets in winter"" and told her ""in shirts i wear a small"" she looked at me and said ""its unisex i'm getting you a large."" I told her ""i'm not wearing a large, i have unisex shirts of my own and i wear a small. 

I'm not wearing 2 sizes too large"" she said ""you are a large women i'm getting you a large"" i'm not even overweight. I wear a small in mens/ unisex so why the f would i wear a large? At this point i was pissed i told her ""at this point you're just wasting your time im a size small in shirts. I'm not wearing a large and being uncomfortable it will not fit right""

I even told her im not a ""large"" woman i'm 130 lbs and 5'8. That is not large/ overweight. Just bc im not 5'4 and 98 lbs does not mean i wear large. 

She refused(i started this job a week ago its a daycare job) the shirt is too big and its annoying what would you do? 

She still sees no wrong🙄 and i keep complaining and telling her i'm just gonna wear my own clothes and not this shirt if she doesn't fix it for starters im in 20s and she's late 30s or early 40s.

"So the backstory is i have been putting immense pressure on it (masturbating, wnd when i was a kid i would yank it which makes it stick out) and I've since stopped. Stopped pulling on it when i was liek 8 lol.

I don't masturbate a lot. Once or twice a week, maybe, and it doesnt always involve clitoral stimulation. Most of the time, its more of a burden than anything because ive got to spend 20 minutes of constant gentle rubbing to work it up to where its actually pleasurable. Vibrators dont give me much pleasure either, usually.

Normally i dont care but recently i lost my virginity to someone (m33) and they seem to want to make me orgasm (bless them lol) and obviously my clit doesnt work properly. I get plenty of stimulation from penetration so thats not so much a problem but ive only ever actually orgasmed by clit stim (which as i said takes a while, and is boring. I literally have to occupy myself watchin YouTube or smth while i do it ((I don't watch porn when masturbating usually)))/

So yeah idk what i can do. If you have any advice let me know","yani arka plan hikayesi, çocukken mastürbasyon yaparken ona çok fazla baskı uyguluyordum ve onu çekerdim ki bu da dışarı çıkmasına neden oluyordu ve o zamandan beri çekmeyi bıraktım, ben de böyleyken lol

haftada bir veya iki kez çok fazla mastürbasyon yapmıyorum belki ve her zaman klitoris uyarımı içermiyor çoğu zaman bir yük çünkü gerçekten zevk verene kadar çalışması için dakikalarca sürekli nazik bir şekilde ovuşturmam gerekiyor vibratörler de bana genellikle fazla zevk vermiyor

normalde umursamıyorum ama yakın zamanda bekaretini birine kaptırdım ve beni orgazm etmek istiyorlar gibi görünüyorlar onları kutsasın lol ve açıkçası klitorisim düzgün çalışmıyor penetrasyondan bolca uyarı alıyorum bu yüzden bu çok da sorun değil ama aslında sadece klitoris uyarımıyla orgazm oldum ki dediğim gibi bu biraz zaman alıyor ve sıkıcı, bunu yaparken kendimi youtube veya başka bir şey izleyerek meşgul etmem gerekiyor mastürbasyon yaparken genellikle porno izlemiyorum

"I (24f) have been living with my roommate (27m) for about 9 months now. We were cool and would hang out occasionally before he moved in with me(known him like 5 years), I always told him I looked at him like a brother &amp; I trusted him. His last lease was up and he needed a place to stay, so I told him he could move into the other bedroom. 

After living together for a few months, one time while we were out drinking he told me he doesn’t view me as a sister, and asked if he would ever have a chance to be with me. I told him no, he’s like a brother to me, and brushed it off as him just being too drunk. A few other times when he came home after a night out of drinking, and I would be getting ready for bed in my room, he would text me weird things like he would give me $1k if I just gave him 20 minutes of my time. Obviously I told him to fuck off and go to sleep. The next morning he would say “omg I’m so sorry, I was way too drunk” etc etc…

He hadn’t done anything weird like that in a while, and with his work schedule we don’t really see each other often or hang out that much. Yesterday he invited me out with him to some local lounge and I had went out the day before so I declined. I went to sleep early and he ended up going out with some friends. Around 4AM I felt something weird on my back, but I thought I was just imagining it. Then I felt something lift up my nightdress and touch my butt (I sleep on my stomach and didn’t have the covers on because I was hot ) so I woke up and see him standing over my bed!! I sat up and cussed him out and told him to get the fuck out of my room. Once he left I went and locked the door, but I couldn’t fall asleep after that. #1 I didn’t even hear him come in my room, which is so creepy to me because what if this is not the first time this happened??? #2 What would have happened if I never woke up?? #3 I knew he was weird but this is actually creepy af and made me feel unsafe. I never thought he would try and sneak into my room, like wtf? 

Anyways idk what to do because I don’t feel comfortable with him anymore. There’s 3 months left on the lease. I would just kick him out now, but I lowkey need the money for his portion of the rent.

"Me and my Husband have been married for 5 years. We have a 3.5 year old daughter and are in a happy marriage. 

I recently brought up wanting to have another with him and he adamantly said he wouldn't have another kid. Asking him why opened a huge can of worms and a huge conversation. He basically said..

1.) His father had very early onset and aggressive dementia that was diagnosed when my husband was 13. My husband basically didn't have a father after that point besides having to care for him. 

2.) My husband had genetic testing done and it was confirmed that he has the same gene they believe caused his father's dementia. He did the math and realized that if we had another kid now, that kid would be 14 years old(at the oldest) when my husband hits the age his dad got diagnosed. That's the main reason he doesn't want another(and to not pass on that gene anymore).

3.) He told me he doesn't know 100% if he'll be diagnosed eventually but if he is he..  ""absolutely plans to end things before he starts going down hill""  and that ""he'll only try to hold off on it until our daughter is 18"". Then he told me exactly how and where he'd do it and what I'd need to do(where he'd try to leave documents, etc). 

I knew the history with his dad and the genetic testing but I had no clue he put that much planning into what he'd do if he got diagnosed. It's freaked me out. How should I handle this? What should I say? He was adamant that he refuses to end up like his father. Advice?","kocam ve ben yıllardır evliyiz, bir yaşında bir kızımız var ve mutlu bir evliliğimiz var

babasının çok erken başlangıçlı ve agresif bunaması vardı, kocam kocam olduğunda teşhis edildi, o noktadan sonra ona bakmak dışında bir babası yoktu

kocam genetik test yaptırdı ve babasının bunamasına neden olduğuna inandıkları aynı gene sahip olduğu doğrulandı, hesapladı ve şimdi başka bir çocuğumuz olursa o çocuğun 4 yaşında olacağını fark etti, kocam babasının teşhis edildiği yaşa geldiğinde en büyüğü bu, başka bir çocuk istememesinin ve artık o geni aktarmamasının ana nedeni bu

bana sonunda teşhis konulup konulmayacağını bilmediğini söyledi ama konursa yokuş aşağı gitmeye başlamadan önce her şeyi bitirmeyi kesinlikle planladığını ve kızımız olana kadar bunu ertelemeye çalışacağını söyledi, sonra bana tam olarak nasıl ve nerede yapacağını ve ne yapacağını söyledi nereye bırakmaya çalışacağını vs. bilmem gerekiyor

ayrıca yakın zamanda bir iş buldum ve oradaki herkes okulda neler yaptıklarından bahsediyor ama ben gerçekten söyleyecek hiçbir şeyim yok bu yüzden ne yapmalıyım"
"I talked to my wife about sex, and she told me she would like to try a threesome with me and another guy. I was taken aback and didn’t know how to respond. Please advise me on whether I should agree or refuse. I just can’t see myself in a threesome with another man or a woman.


UPDATE: I talked to my wife, and we both came to the conclusion that a threesome would be very harmful for us, and that we would both be jealous of each other. We will work together to fix the mistakes we’ve made. We’ll only fulfill fantasies that we can do together. We’re not letting anyone else into our bed.","eşimle seks hakkında konuştum ve bana benimle ve başka bir adamla üçlü yapmayı denemek istediğini söyledi, şaşırdım ve nasıl cevap vereceğimi bilemedim lütfen bana kabul edip etmemem konusunda tavsiyede bulunun, kendimi başka bir erkekle veya kadınla üçlü yaparken göremiyorum

güncelleme eşimle konuştum ve ikimiz de üçlü yapmanın bizim için çok zararlı olacağı ve birbirimizi kıskanacağımız sonucuna vardık, yaptığımız hataları düzeltmek için birlikte çalışacağız, sadece birlikte yapabileceğimiz fantezileri gerçekleştireceğiz, yatağımıza başka kimseyi almayacağız"
"My girlfriend (25F) told me (27M) she is a diagnosed psychopath. Is this something to be considered about?

My gf told me recently that she was diagnosed as a psychopath when she was 20 years old and I'm the only person she's told over then her parents and one friend. She says that she trusts me enough to be open about her mental health. 

We met back in mid-2022 and we've been dating since 2023. We got along well, we both like anime, movies and cooking and in general she is just a lovely person to be around plus she's got an absolute dump truck. I still really like her but I don't know how to take this news. I feel like I've been deceived and manipulated by her. How do I know she feels what she says she feels or believes what she says she believes? 

I've done research on ASPD and although I know the ASPD of Hollywood and pop psychologists is different then what it is in reality but the more research I've done the more concerning it becomes. I don't know if I can still keep seeing het but I still like her. If you were in my situation would you still keep seeing her? ","kız arkadaşım bana teşhis konulmuş bir psikopat olduğunu söyledi, bu düşünülmesi gereken bir şey mi

kız arkadaşım bana yakın zamanda 19 yaşındayken kendisine psikopat teşhisi konduğunu ve bunu ailesinden ve bir arkadaşından başka kimseye söylemediğini söyledi, bana ruh sağlığı konusunda yeterince güvendiğini söylüyor

orta yaşlarında tanıştık ve iyi anlaştığımız zamandan beri çıkıyoruz, ikimiz de anime filmlerini ve yemek yapmayı seviyoruz ve genel olarak etrafta olması çok hoş bir insan, ayrıca tam bir damperli kamyonu var, ondan hala çok hoşlanıyorum ama bu haberi nasıl karşılayacağımı bilmiyorum, sanki onun tarafından aldatılmış ve manipüle edilmişim gibi hissediyorum, ne hissettiğini veya neye inandığını nasıl bilebilirim

aspd hakkında araştırma yaptım ve hollywood ve popüler psikologların aspd'sinin gerçekte olduğundan farklı olduğunu bilmeme rağmen, ne kadar çok araştırma yaparsam o kadar endişe verici oluyor, onu görmeye devam edebilir miyim bilmiyorum ama onu hala seviyorum, eğer benim durumumda olsaydınız onu görmeye devam eder miydiniz"
"In middle school, Me and my friend (let's call her Emma) were really close. We weren't the best behaved kids in class. We casually got drunk, smoked, got in fights, disrupted class, all that stuff. Teachers never really liked us that much, but I usually got in trouble more than she did. Most of the staff viewed her as an angel that was being manipulated by me, when usually it was the opposite. We were always with each other, we always facetimed, went to parties together, did everything together.

One day Emma doesn't show up to school (pretty normal, not that shocking). Then I got called to the office (pretty normal, not that shocking). The principal tells me that a girl in our class had accused Emma of beating her up on her way home from school, and claimed I was there too (I was not). I say nothing. The principal then tells me that she knows about everything I've done in school with Emma (vaping in school, cheating, etc) and that if I didn't snitch on her, I would be expelled and not be able to graduate. I obviously started sobbing and spilled everything that Emma had done and not gotten caught for. 

Emma wasn't able to graduate from middle school, I was.

I ended up testing into a very prestigious high school, getting multiple loving friends, and I'm now trying to quit vaping and drinking and so far I'm successful.

Emma ended up getting pregnant as a teen. She's constantly in and out of different rehabs and mental hospitals. She never got higher education than middle school. She's a shell of the girl she was when I was her friend.

I've been thinking about this for months. Am I at fault for ruining her life? What could I have done different? Should I have gotten punished too?","ortaokulda arkadaşımla ona emma diyelim çok yakındık sınıftaki en iyi huylu çocuklar değildik rahatça sarhoş olur, sigara içer, kavga eder, dersi bölerdik bütün bu şeyler öğretmenler bizi hiç sevmezdi ama ben genelde ondan daha çok başım derde girerdi personelin çoğu onu benim tarafımdan manipüle edilen bir melek olarak görürdü genelde tam tersi olurdu hep birbirimizle olurduk hep görüntülü konuşurduk birlikte partilere giderdik her şeyi birlikte yapardık

bir gün emma okula gelmezse bu gayet normal o kadar da şaşırtıcı değil sonra beni ofise çağırdılar gayet normal o kadar da şaşırtıcı değil müdür sınıftaki bir kızın emma'yı okuldan eve dönerken onu dövdüğüyle suçladığını ve benim de orada olduğumu iddia ettiğini söyledi ben orada değildim hiçbir şey söylemedim müdür sonra bana okulda emma ile yaptığım her şeyi bildiğini okulda elektronik sigara kullandığımı hile yaptığımı vs. ve eğer onu ihbar etmezsem okuldan atılacağımı ve mezun olamayacağımı söyledi belli ki hıçkırarak ağlamaya başladım ve emma'nın yaptığı her şeyi anlattım ve yakalanmadım

emma mezun olamadı ortaokuldaydım

çok prestijli bir liseye girdim, çok sayıda sevgi dolu arkadaş edindim ve şimdi buharlamayı ve içkiyi bırakmaya çalışıyorum ve şimdiye kadar başarılıyım

emma gençken hamile kaldı, sürekli olarak farklı rehabilitasyon merkezlerine ve akıl hastanelerine girip çıkıyor, ortaokuldan daha yüksek bir eğitim alamadı, ben onun arkadaşı olduğum zamanki kızın kabuğu

aylardır bunu düşünüyorum, hayatını mahvettiğim için ben mi suçluyum, neyi farklı yapabilirdim ki ben de cezalandırılmalıydım"

I had been thinking seriously about breaking up with him  because what he did 2 weeks ago , things started getting back to normal and he was acting fine until 4 days ago 

I was out with my friends at this cafe, and I told him I was going out but didn’t tell him name of cafe. I told him I’d be home by 7, I lost track off time and my phone also died , it had been almost 8 nd I see him walk in the cafe towards me , I still have no fucking idea how he knew where I was since I didn't tell him what cafe , neither my frds told him anything, I asked him n he ignored saying he got worried i wasn't picking up calls so he came to check up ,i didn't argue much since we were in public 

 back home, I confronted him because it's so fucking creepy n my invasion of privacy , he never answered my q
Then says me that he can't trust me anymore because I've been distant since the tattoo situation!!!?? 
And every time Im wd my frds he thinks I'm plotting for our break up and distancing myself
Rants bullshit like this for 15 mins until I'm fed up and I tell him I want to break up , he looked completely shocked ,he didn't say anything and went straight to the guest room and locked the door 

I panicked cuz I thought he might do anything stupid , I don't trust him regarding all this now but said he needs to think so I left him alone

I didn't sleep , it was around 3:25am when I hear thud sounds outside my room and I go guest room and its a mess , he's completely drunk  &amp; had red eyes idek for God knows how long he had been crying he looked like a completely different person and then says to me that he loves me more than anything and can die for me and would do anything to make me happy and doesn't understand why I can't forgive him for that one mistake he's made 2 weeks ago that he's deeply regretting about...also said he's not trying to control me but he can't be sit silently and watch me walk away , he will change himself for better but won't let me leave ever

I didn't wanna talk all this while he was in this state so I started to leave the room n he stopped me saying he will give me space and time however much I want but won't let me break up with him and keep coming back to me until I figure this out and get wthd him back 
I was soo taken back on how he was reacting to all this and wtf was he saying
I still can't get this line out of my head it keeps repeating  
I'll make u see how much i love u evun if yxu don't want it , I'll do anythng to make you stay, I don't care if it takes months or fucking years

Hearing all this I actually started fearing him for the first time he was completely different soo unrecognisable, and it's all so wrong on so many levels 
I knew what I had to do , and I knew if I started to pack my bags that sec , Idk what he might have done , I go in our room , didn't open it  ,5 hours later n I find him asleep on the floor , I get out of the apartment nd currently staying in my frds house

Been 3 days , he had been contacting non stop ,to just talk him once in person ,834 missed calls and a gazillion msgs came to my frds house to talk where I was staying , but I refused to talk

I'm a mess rn I don't know how to fucking handle this situation all my things are at his apartment &amp; I don't want to face him , specially now , I don't feel like talking him rn it's all so fucking creepy and I hate mysself sm rn that I still love and care about him after all this and the shit he pulled 2 weeks ago and I cannot do anything I don't know what to do where did I go wrong and why is this shit all happening to me I did everything I could to fix all dis but he's just changed so m in the past months I don't know what to fucking do I am losing my mind why the fuck I still love him I literally don't know how to get past this situation.


**EDIT**:Thank you to everyone who’s reached out, it’s been a lot to process. I’m still trying to wrap my head around everything that’s happened , I’ll update y’all on the situation and what’s going on with us in a few days once I’ve got everything sorted out and can actually think straight.

Haftalar önce yaptığı şeyler yüzünden onunla ayrılmayı ciddi ciddi düşünüyordum, işler normale dönmeye başlamıştı ve birkaç gün öncesine kadar gayet iyi davranıyordu

Arkadaşlarımla bir kafedeydim ve ona dışarı çıkacağımı söyledim ama kafenin adını söylemedim, eve geleceğimi söyledim, saatin kaç olduğunu anlayamadım ve telefonum da öldü, neredeyse kafeye doğru yürüdüğünü gördüm, nerede olduğumu nasıl bildiğini hala bilmiyorum, çünkü ona hangi kafe olduğunu söylemedim, arkadaşlarım da ona hiçbir şey söylemedi, ona sordum ve o da endişelendiğini söyleyerek görmezden geldi, aramaları açmıyordum, bu yüzden kontrol etmeye geldi, halka açık bir yerde olduğumuz için fazla tartışmadım

Evde onunla yüzleştim çünkü çok ürkütücüydü ve mahremiyetime yaptığım müdahale yüzünden hiç cevap vermedi q
sonra bana dövme olayından beri mesafeli olduğum için artık bana güvenemeyeceğini söyledi
ve her seferinde arkadaşlarımla görüştüğümde ayrılmak için plan yaptığımı ve kendimi uzaklaştırdığımı düşünüyor
bıkana kadar dakikalarca böyle saçmalıklar sayıklıyor ve ona ayrılmak istediğimi söylüyorum tamamen şok olmuş gibi görünüyordu hiçbir şey söylemedi ve doğruca misafir odasına gidip kapıyı kilitledi

panikledim çünkü aptalca bir şey yapabileceğini düşündüm şimdi tüm bunlar konusunda ona güvenmiyorum ama düşünmesi gerektiğini söyledi bu yüzden onu yalnız bıraktım

uyuyamadım sabahın erken saatlerinde odamın dışından gelen gürültüleri duyduğumda misafir odasına gittim ve her yer darmadağındı tamamen sarhoştu ve gözleri kıpkırmızıydı ne kadar zamandır ağladığını bilmiyorum tamamen farklı bir insan gibi görünüyordu ve sonra bana beni her şeyden çok sevdiğini ve benim için ölebileceğini ve beni mutlu etmek için her şeyi yapabileceğini ve haftalar önce yaptığı ve derinden pişman olduğu o hata için neden onu affedemediğimi anlamadığını söyledi ayrıca beni kontrol etmeye çalışmadığını ama sessizce oturup beni yürürken izleyemez, kendini daha iyiye doğru değiştirecek ama asla gitmeme izin vermeyecek

o bu haldeyken tüm bunları konuşmak istemedim bu yüzden odadan çıkmaya başladım ve beni durdurdu, bana istediğim kadar alan ve zaman vereceğini ama onunla ayrılmama izin vermeyeceğini ve bunu çözüp onu geri kazanana kadar bana geri döneceğini söyledi
tüm bunlara nasıl tepki verdiğine çok şaşırmıştım ve ne diyordu
bu cümleyi hala aklımdan çıkaramıyorum, tekrar edip duruyor
sana seni ne kadar sevdiğimi göstereceğim, eğer sen istemezsen bile kalman için her şeyi yapacağım, aylar veya lanet yıllar sürmesi umrumda değil

tüm bunları duyunca ilk defa ondan korkmaya başladım, tamamen farklıydı, çok tanınmazdı ve her şey birçok açıdan çok yanlıştı
ne yapmam gerektiğini biliyordum ve eğer çantalarımı toplamaya başlasaydım o saniye ne yapmış olabileceğini bilmiyordum, odamıza girdim, açılmadı saatler sonra onu yerde uyurken buldum daireden çıktım ve şu anda arkadaşımın evinde kalıyor

günlerdir durmadan arayıp sadece bir kez şahsen konuşmak için arıyordu cevapsız aramalar ve arkadaşımın evine nerede kaldığımı konuşmak için bir gazilyon mesaj geldi ama konuşmayı reddettim

çok kötüyüm şu an bu durumla nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum tüm eşyalarım onun dairesinde ve onunla yüzleşmek istemiyorum özellikle şimdi onunla konuşmak istemiyorum şu an her şey çok ürkütücü ve kendimden nefret ediyorum sm şu an hala onu seviyorum ve tüm bunlardan ve haftalar önce yaptığı boktan şeylerden sonra ve hiçbir şey yapamıyorum ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum nerede yanlış yaptım ve neden tüm bunlar benim başıma geliyor tüm bunları düzeltmek için elimden gelen her şeyi yaptım ama o sadece değişti bu yüzden son aylarda ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum aklımı kaçırıyorum neden hala onu seviyorum kelimenin tam anlamıyla bu durumu nasıl aşacağımı bilmiyorum

düzenle bana ulaşan herkese teşekkür ederim işlemesi çok zordu hala kafamı toparlamaya çalışıyorum Olan biten her şey hakkında sizi birkaç gün içinde durum ve bizimle ilgili gelişmeler hakkında bilgilendireceğim, her şeyi yoluna koyduğumda ve doğru düzgün düşünebildiğimde"
"Hey Reddit, I need some advice. I’m a 23M, and my girlfriend (22F) and I have been dating for about six months now. Everything’s been great—until recently, when I made an unexpected discovery.

So, I moved in with her a few weeks ago, and while unpacking and settling in, I came across a pretty large collection of… well, let’s just say “adult toys” in her nightstand. Now, I’m not a prude or anything, but it kind of caught me off guard. She’s never mentioned anything about it, and it’s not something we’ve ever used or talked about together.

What makes it more awkward is that some of the items are really, uh, advanced? Like, I didn’t even know half of that stuff existed.

Now I’m wondering if I should bring it up or just let it slide. Part of me is curious if this is something she wants to use together but hasn’t brought it up yet, or if it’s just her thing and I should respect her privacy.

I’m not insecure or anything, but I don’t want there to be this weird unspoken thing between us. Should I bring it up casually and see what she says? Or is it better to just leave it and not risk making things awkward?

TL;DR: Found my girlfriend’s collection of adult toys after moving in together. Should I bring it up, or just let it be and respect her privacy?

","hey reddit biraz tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var ben bir m ve kız arkadaşım f ve ben yaklaşık altı aydır çıkıyoruz her şey harikaydı ta ki yakın zamanda beklenmedik bir keşif yapana kadar

bu yüzden birkaç hafta önce onunla yaşamaya başladım ve eşyaları yerleştirirken ve yerleşirken komodinin üzerinde oldukça büyük bir yetişkin oyuncakları koleksiyonuyla karşılaştım şimdi ben muhafazakar biri değilim ya da öyle bir şey ama beni hazırlıksız yakaladı bu konudan hiç bahsetmedi ve birlikte kullandığımız ya da konuştuğumuz bir şey değil

daha da garip olanı bazı eşyaların gerçekten çok gelişmiş olması, sanki bunların yarısının varlığından bile haberim yoktu

şimdi bunu gündeme getirsem mi yoksa öylece bıraksam mı diye düşünüyorum bir yanım bunun birlikte kullanmak istediği bir şey olup olmadığını ama henüz dile getirmediğini ya da sadece onun bir şeyi olup olmadığını ve mahremiyetine saygı duymam gerekip gerekmediğini merak ediyor

güvensiz biri değilim ya da öyle bir şey ama aramızda bu garip, dile getirilmeyen bir şey olmasını istemiyorum bunu gelişigüzel dile getirip ne diyeceğine mi bakmalıyım yoksa öylece bırakıp bir şeyler yapma riskine girmemek mi daha iyi garip

tldr birlikte yaşamaya başladıktan sonra kız arkadaşımın yetişkin oyuncakları koleksiyonunu buldum, bunu gündeme getirmeli miyim yoksa olduğu gibi bırakıp mahremiyetine saygı mı göstermeliyim"

"This sounds very high school, I know. I am trying to be an adult about it, but the fact is that this woman is adored by nearly all my friends and acquaintances, yet every time I meet her, she makes me cringe so hard that I have to tune out of the conversation or leave the room.

You think i'm being dramatic? The first time I met her, the minute we were alone together, she immediately unloaded on me about having sexual fantasies about teenage boys. My immediate reaction was, of course, along the WTF lines. I do not know you and I already think you should be investigated!

I only moved back to my country recently after 3 years overseas. It seems like every time I go out with my friends, we'll invite some other people along and that seems to nearly always include her. And she is always, always saying some really messed-up, or otherwise bizarre, shit.

One time, she bulldozed through the group conversation in order to (while hyper-focusing on me, for some reason) tell a lengthy saga about a holiday gone wrong in France. In this long and incredibly delusional story, she told me about befriending a group of homeless people, then her treating them to a weekend in a spa resort together, where she was then kissed by a member of One Direction. This was ... such an outrageous sack of bullshit ... I kept glancing at everyone else, wondering if anyone was going to call BS on her, but they looked _entranced_. There have been other incidents like this.

Genuinely, the woman is a walking caricature. I do not understand how she has any friends at all, let alone why she is so popular. My friends love her and think she's cool. Everything I know about her has been extremely off-putting to me and I have started snapping at her whenever she says anything to me. I can't help it. I do not like her voice, I do not her personality or her obvious main character syndrome, and I do not like her face.

I am tempted to ask my friends to stop inviting her to join us, or at least count me out if they plan on inviting her. Is this childish? What should I do?","bu çok liseli bir kız gibi geliyor biliyorum bu konuda yetişkin olmaya çalışıyorum ama gerçek şu ki bu kadın neredeyse tüm arkadaşlarım ve tanıdıklarım tarafından çok seviliyor ama onunla her karşılaştığımda beni öylesine ürpertiyor ki konuşmayı kesmek veya odadan çıkmak zorunda kalıyorum

ilk tanıştığımızda dramatik davrandığımı mı düşünüyorsun yalnız kaldığımız anda hemen bana ergen erkeklerle ilgili cinsel fanteziler kurduğunu söyledi ilk tepkim tabii ki wtf tarzındaydı seni tanımıyorum ve zaten araştırılman gerektiğini düşünüyorum

yıllarca yurtdışında yaşadıktan sonra yakın zamanda ülkeme geri döndüm sanki arkadaşlarımla dışarı çıktığımda başka insanları da davet ediyorum ve buna neredeyse her zaman o da dahil oluyor ve o her zaman gerçekten berbat veya tuhaf şeyler söylüyor

bir keresinde grup sohbetini alt üst etti ve nedense bana aşırı odaklanarak Fransa'da ters giden bir tatil hakkında uzun bir hikaye anlattı bu uzun ve inanılmaz derecede hayal ürünü hikayede bana bir grup evsizle arkadaş olduğunu ve sonra onları nasıl ağırladığını anlattı bir spa merkezinde birlikte geçirdikleri bir hafta sonu ve ardından one direction'dan bir üye tarafından öpüldüler bu çok saçma bir saçmalıktı sürekli herkese bakıp durdum acaba birileri ona yalan mı diyecek diye ama büyülenmiş gibi görünüyorlardı bunun gibi başka olaylar da oldu

gerçekten kadın yürüyen bir karikatür nasıl hiç arkadaşı olduğunu anlamıyorum neden bu kadar popüler olduğunu hiç anlamıyorum arkadaşlarım onu ​​seviyor ve havalı buluyor onun hakkında bildiğim her şey beni aşırı derecede rahatsız ediyor ve bana bir şey söylediğinde ona çıkışmaya başladım buna engel olamıyorum sesini sevmiyorum kişiliğini veya belirgin ana karakter sendromunu sevmiyorum ve yüzünü de beğenmiyorum

"I’m 22f and no I’m not sending nudes but I relapsed posting today and posted a shit ton of anonymous exposing nudes on reddit. I took them down because I have learned firsthand the internet is forever. I go to college and am severely depressed and this has been the one thing that thrills me. A friend of mine called while I was doing this and a part of me wanted to talk about it but I knew he wouldn’t understand. I’ve talked in the past how horrible it felt when a guy I knew irl found my nudes and secretly jerked off to them. I understand the consequences of my actions but I can’t stop. It’s my fetish and it turns me on much more than sex showing off to strangers and I don’t even care to build relationships. I live in an extremely strict immigrant household and would kill myself if I got exposed. At the same time I have no other outlet and I tried sending nudes privately and doing tasks for people but it’s not the same. I love the attention because i don’t feel loved in other ways. I skipped class today and I do this shit for hours and I have a real addiction but I can’t stop. It started when I was a minor and showed off to strangers online and got groomed but honestly my exhibitionist side has been there since I was a child. I wish I could get a clean slate but I fear that I can never change and nothing will fulfill me as much. Thousands and thousands of people have seen me naked and god knows how many people have my nudes saved on their phone and I can never take it back. I understand it’s the consequence of my actions but please help, I can’t stop showing myself off regardless of the consequences.

"My little brother is 12 years old and I am 19. We have finally built up a relationship where he feels he can confide in me and we joke around and watch movies and everything together. I told my parents 2 years ago when I felt his behavior and actions getting out of control and told them they needed to get a handle on it before it was too late. Now it is too late. He told me yesterday during movie night “what’s your body count?!” And he always makes crude sexual jokes and stuff which my family always plays off as oh he’s a middle schooler it happens. But I jokingly said “I’m not telling until you tell me yours!” To avoid the question and move on. But he told me 2!? And i asked details trying to keep cool and take a “hahah so cool” approach. He told me when he goes to a certain friends house that girls spend the night and he lost it playing 7 minutes it heaven. And has had sexual relations with another but it didn’t count as sex. So one body. 12 years old &amp; knows nothing about safe sex. HELP. I don’t want to betray him and it get back to him that i told on him but I am concerned for his safety.

"I'm a dance school owner, and have a bit of a problem. A 7 year old girl and her family have caused a lot of trouble within the school, and are driving other students away. What is the best way to politely / ethically ask this family to leave? I've never had to take such drastic measures before, but they've caused so many issues, including ones that have detrimented the reputation (legally) of another family 😬
They're the type to become confrontational, and I don't want to be too harsh on the dancer, especially since she's young.",Ben bir dans okulu sahibiyim ve biraz sorunum var. Bir yaşında bir kız çocuğu ve ailesi okulda çok fazla sorun çıkardı ve diğer öğrencileri uzaklaştırıyor. Bu aileden ayrılmalarını nazikçe ve etik bir şekilde istemenin en iyi yolu nedir? Daha önce hiç bu kadar sert önlemler almak zorunda kalmamıştım ancak bunlar başka bir ailenin yasal itibarını zedeleyenler de dahil olmak üzere birçok soruna yol açtı. Onlar çatışmacı tipler ve özellikle genç olduğu için dansçıya karşı çok sert olmak istemiyorum.
"My friend has been injecting people with filler and Botox, not sure what else she does but she does all things a esthetician does. She has a instagram page dedicated to her work, and tbh it doesn’t look great. Specifically the lip filler because all she does is the Russian lip technique (which is very bad for ur lip autonomy and dangerous). Anyways, she keeps saying she wants to have a Botox party with all of our girlfriends and inject us with botox. Even told me that she’d do my lips with her “technique”. My other friend is going to her soon to get her lips done. 

I was texting her tonight and long story short I asked her why she doesn’t open a med spa to inject people. As of now she does it in her apartment. She said “Because I’m not registered in the US only overseas”… I asked her why she doesn’t get her degree here, since whats she’s doing is extremely illegal, and her response was “I’m not planning to do another 4 years of college”. She was a nurse in Russia which is ironic considering all she does is the Russian lip technique lol. 

From what I read online, a nursing degree in Russia is nowhere near a nursing degree in the US. I spoke to my other friend who works at a med spa and she confirmed that you have to get a nursing degree here in order to do what she’s doing. Idk if I should tell her straight up what she’s doing is illegal and not ethical at all. Especially since the photos of her work look rlly bad and the only technique she’s using is dangerous. If something goes wrong she’d get in a lot of trouble. Should I confront her? Or tell my gf that’s going to get her lips done by her the truth? ","arkadaşım insanlara dolgu ve botoks enjekte ediyor başka ne yaptığını bilmiyorum ama bir güzellik uzmanının yaptığı her şeyi yapıyor, işine adanmış bir instagram sayfası var ve dürüst olmak gerekirse özellikle dudak dolgusu pek iyi görünmüyor çünkü yaptığı tek şey dudak özerkliğiniz için çok kötü ve tehlikeli olan rus dudak tekniği, sürekli tüm kız arkadaşlarımızla bir botoks partisi yapmak ve bize botoks enjekte etmek istediğini söylüyor hatta bana dudaklarımı onun tekniğiyle yapacağını söyledi diğer arkadaşım da yakında dudaklarını yaptırmak için ona gidecek

bu gece ona mesaj atıyordum ve uzun lafın kısası ona neden insanlara enjeksiyon yapmak için bir medikal spa açmadığını sordum, şu anda bunu dairesinde yapıyor, sadece yurtdışında abd'de kayıtlı olmadığımı söyledi, neden burada diploma almadığını sordum çünkü yaptığı şey son derece yasadışı ve bana verdiği cevap başka bir yıl üniversite okumayı planlamadığım oldu, rusya'da hemşireydi, yaptığı tek şeyin rus dudak tekniği olması düşünüldüğünde bu ironik lol

internetten okuduğum kadarıyla rusya'da hemşirelik diploması hiçbir yerde yok ABD'de hemşirelik diplomasına yakın bir zamanda, bir medikal spa'da çalışan diğer arkadaşımla konuştum ve bana burada yaptığı şeyi yapabilmek için hemşirelik diploması almanız gerektiğini doğruladı. Ona yaptığı şeyin yasadışı ve etik olmadığını açıkça söylemeli miyim bilmiyorum. Özellikle de işinin fotoğrafları gerçekten kötü göründüğünden ve kullandığı tek teknik tehlikeli olduğundan, bir şeyler ters giderse başı büyük belaya girer. Onunla yüzleşmeli miyim yoksa kız arkadaşıma mı söylemeliyim? Bu onun dudaklarına yapılacak. Gerçek şu ki"
"My (25F) Nana (63F) was senselessly murdered in a very public event this year. To put it in perspective, the life flight team visited us on day 3 and said she was the worst they had ever seen and couldn’t believe she was alive when they got there. I watched her suffer for 8 days, watched her beg for help between surgeries, and watched her take her last breathe as I tried to be brave and sing her her favorite hymn. 

In the middle of my grief, just two months later, I find out my long term, live in boyfriend was married to another woman.

I’m distraught. I miss her more than words can express, and the images in my head are awful. My boyfriend stomped the pieces of my already broken heart into powder.

Despite doing okay for myself independently, I have no will to live. This world is so bad, and it feels that all that waits for me is bad. I’m so tired. I go to therapy, I’m a professional, I own a home, but nothing makes me feel better…what can I do to help myself? 

All I ever wanted was a stable income and home, and above all, a loving partner and family to call my own. And that feels so impossible for me to ever have.  I’m too messed up and there aren’t enough good people left to find me and accept me with my trauma. 

And even if I did find someone I could trust again, by some miracle…I don’t want to do it all without her. She was my most trusted friend, and I always imagined her being a great influence on my future children. 

My hope is gone. This insomnia and ache in my heart will be the death of me. I’m scared I’ll never have a love I deserve, scared of the world, and just scared in general. I need a will to live. I don’t have a reason to go on right now. Has anyone come back from complete devastation? How did you do it?

Im so tired and I don’t know who I am anymore. I used to be a funny, motivated, and warm woman…now I’m only a remnant of her. The feelings that the murder has brought out in me don’t feel like my own. I’m not a hateful person. How did you find yourself again?","f nana f bu yıl çok kamuya açık bir olayda anlamsızca öldürüldü, perspektife koymak gerekirse, can kurtarma ekibi o gün bizi ziyaret etti ve gördükleri en kötü kadın olduğunu ve oraya vardıklarında hayatta olduğuna inanamadıklarını söylediler, günlerce acı çektiğini izledim, ameliyatlar arasında yardım için yalvarmasını izledim ve son nefesini verirken cesur olmaya ve ona en sevdiği ilahiyi söylemeye çalıştım

kederimin ortasında, sadece iki ay sonra uzun süredir birlikte olduğum erkek arkadaşımın başka bir kadınla evli olduğunu öğrendim

çok üzgünüm, onu kelimelerle ifade edebileceğimden daha fazla özlüyorum ve kafamdaki görüntüler korkunç, erkek arkadaşım zaten kırılmış olan kalbimin parçalarını toza çevirdi

kendim için bağımsız bir şekilde iyi olmama rağmen yaşama isteğim yok, bu dünya çok kötü ve beni bekleyen her şeyin kötü olduğunu hissediyorum, çok yorgunum, terapiye gidiyorum, profesyonelim, bir evim var ama hiçbir şey beni daha iyi hissettirmiyor, kendime nasıl yardım edebilirim

tek istediğim istikrarlı bir gelir ve ev ve her şeyden önce sevgi dolu bir eş ve kendime ait diyebileceğim bir aileydi ve bu çok imkansız görünüyor benim için hiç olmadı çok karmakarışık ve beni bulacak ve travmamla beni kabul edecek yeterli sayıda iyi insan kalmadı

ve bir mucize eseri tekrar güvenebileceğim birini bulsam bile onsuz her şeyi yapmak istemiyorum o benim en güvendiğim arkadaşımdı ve onun gelecekteki çocuklarım üzerinde büyük bir etkisi olacağını hep hayal ettim

umudum tükendi bu uykusuzluk ve kalbimdeki sızı benim ölümüm olacak korkuyorum asla bir aşkım olmayacak hak ediyorum dünyadan korkuyorum ve genel olarak korkuyorum yaşamak için bir iradeye ihtiyacım var şu anda devam etmek için bir sebebim yok tam bir yıkımdan geri dönen oldu mu bunu nasıl yaptın

"This is a problem that has been happening for years, but has be concentrated more so in the last year or so.

I (17FTM) can hear my dad (42M) and stepmom (43F) having sex from my room. They are incredibly loud and not discreet whatsoever. I had to move rooms because of it, and even now that my room is at the end of the hallway, I can still hear them.

If it was a one-off thing, I would be far less angry and upset about it. But as of today, it has gotten to the point that I have had to sit outside because I could hear them from downstairs.

My stepmom has apologized once, as is the main problem, as she makes all the noise. My dad, on the other hand, continually apologizes and says it won't happen again, then doesn't try to fix anything after it does. Today, he also decided to give me details of why it was so loud, much to my discomfort and disgust.

I don't care that they're having sex. It is the furthest issue in my mind, and they can do whatever they want. My issue is that they are being loud while knowing I am down the hall and can hear them, and that they have continued to fall short on apologies and changing their behavior.

Any advice? Can I even do anything at this point?","bu yıllardır devam eden bir sorun ama son bir yıldır daha da yoğunlaştı

babam ve üvey annemin seks yaptığını odamdan duyabiliyorum inanılmaz gürültülüler ve hiç de gizli değiller bu yüzden oda değiştirmek zorunda kaldım ve odam koridorun sonunda olmasına rağmen hala onları duyabiliyorum

tek seferlik bir şey olsaydı çok daha az sinirlenir ve üzülürdüm ama bugün itibariyle aşağıdan duyabildiğim için dışarıda oturmak zorunda kaldım

üvey annem bir kez özür diledi ki asıl sorun bu çünkü tüm gürültüyü o yapıyor diğer yandan babam sürekli özür diliyor ve bir daha olmayacağını söylüyor sonra da bugün bir şey yaptıktan sonra hiçbir şeyi düzeltmeye çalışmıyor ayrıca neden bu kadar gürültülü olduğunu bana anlatmaya karar verdi çok rahatsız oldum ve iğrendim

seks yapmaları umurumda değil aklımdaki en uzak konu ve istediklerini yapabilirler benim sorunum koridorda olduğumu ve onları duyabildiğimi bilmelerine rağmen yüksek sesle konuşmaları ve devam etmeleri özür dileme ve davranışlarını değiştirme konusunda yetersiz kalmak

bu noktada yapabileceğim bir şey var mı?"
"I (24M) have been through quite an ordeal this past week, and I need to get this off my chest. So, my co-worker (25F) went missing about a week ago. We work together, and I was the only one who knew her last whereabouts. Naturally, I was really worried and informed the police, who filed a report. But after a week with no follow-up from them, I decided to take matters into my own hands.

Her boyfriend, who is 47, reached out to me for more information. Despite the age difference, they seemed really happy together, and he was genuinely concerned. I gave him all the details I had and offered to help him find her.

We both suspected her abusive ex-boyfriend (27M), who had been stalking her and was insanely jealous of her new relationship with a successful older man. We informed the police about this, but they didn't do much.

Long story short, our instincts were right. We managed to track her down, and with our combined efforts, we helped her escape from her ex. Thankfully, the ex got arrested.

Now here's the twist. My girlfriend (24F) is really mad at me for getting involved, especially because of the older boyfriend. She thinks he's too old for my co-worker and doesn't understand why I helped him. I get where she's coming from, but I couldn't just sit back knowing I had information that could help.

I tried explaining to her that I had information that could help find her and she needed help, so I helped her boyfriend find her. She needed help, and I helped. My girlfriend is really mad at me and thinks I should have kept my information to myself. 

She said I was wrong for doing what I was doing and said, 'You should own up to your mistake and stop gaslighting me into thinking you were doing the right thing.' I don't think I was gaslighting her, and I genuinely feel that I was doing the right thing. If my co-worker was a man and his girlfriend was in her 40s or 50s, I would still have helped try to find him because I think it's just simply the right thing to do. It's not like I immediately contacted her boyfriend; it was a week and no information was coming out from the police, and he contacted me.","Geçtiğimiz hafta oldukça zorlu bir süreçten geçtim ve bunu içimden atmam gerekiyor, bu yüzden iş arkadaşım f yaklaşık bir hafta önce kayboldu, birlikte çalışıyoruz ve son yerini bilen tek kişi bendim, doğal olarak çok endişelendim ve polise haber verdiler, onlar da bir rapor tuttular ancak bir hafta sonra onlardan hiçbir geri dönüş alamayınca meseleyi kendi ellerime almaya karar verdim

Yaş farkına rağmen daha fazla bilgi almak için bana ulaşan erkek arkadaşı, birlikte çok mutlu görünüyorlardı ve gerçekten endişeliydi, ona sahip olduğum tüm detayları verdim ve onu bulmasına yardım etmeyi teklif ettim

"Hello everyone! I wanted to share something that seems absurd to me. 

Three weeks ago, I broke my elbow, and after a few days, I finally got to see an orthopedist (let's call him A). A alarmed me by insisting that surgery was urgently needed. He warned me that without it, I might not fully regain the ability to extend my arm or perform basic tasks like lifting objects. Despite the urgency conveyed, he scheduled the surgery for TWO WEEKS later!  
In the meantime, I sought second opinions from other orthopedists, who advised against surgery (or, in one case, suggested waiting to see how my arm fares after removing the cast).  
I also consulted with a physiotherapist, who happens to be a relative of mine and collaborates with doctor A.  
This morning, Doctor A called me and said something I found absurd. He claimed that because I sought other opinions, trust between us was lost. He insisted that I should have blindly followed his advice and not sought alternative perspectives. Furthermore, he implied that because trust was now lacking, the post-surgery outcome might be compromised, and the operation might not yield optimal results. Essentially, he canceled the surgery, despite initially stressing its urgency!  
Naturally, I am hesitant to proceed with surgery, especially under the guidance of such an unprofessional doctor. What are your thoughts on this situation? Would you place your trust in the physiotherapist (he is the only one who could have told everything to doctor A)?","herkese merhaba, bana saçma gelen bir şeyi paylaşmak istedim

"On Friday I came home from work, my wife told me she no longer loves me the same and doesn’t think we should stay together. My wife is the reason I do anything and my best friend. I’m also still completely infatuated with her even with her not feeling the same way. But just days before this news my wife was still acting mostly normal but a little distant. I have been focusing heavily on work and I recognize that I have not been as available emotionally or even been my normal self lately as well. I am checked in now and ready to improve

I am devastated and having a lot of trouble coping. 

She and I will still live in the same home for the time being and I have every intention of trying to save our marriage. 

I need advice on what to do. I feel completely overwhelmed. 

Edit for more info. All advice is appreciated, if nothing else it helps me wrangle the thoughts in my head.

She just turned 30, I am 31. We have been together since we were kids. And married early. I dropped out of high school and she was the one that propped me up and motivated me to be a successful adult and changed the direction of my life. And I was there for her through her loosing both her parents and being f estranged from her family. I helped support her through a weight loss journey and helped her to live a better life as well. She has always been there for me emotionally up until this week. To me our love seemed perfect and never ending. 

New edit.
I have been speaking to crisis councilors and they have given me some good clarity. 
I appreciate the good and bad and strange advice and feedback everyone has given me. I know my wife has not been unfaithful. I believe she is going through mental demons that I failed to support her through. I am going to work on myself and hopefully be the man she truly needs and wants. If she decides different then I will try to find a way to move on.

"Throw away account.

My(28F) husband(30M) got asked to be a sperm donor by one of his cousins. His cousin is genetically infertile and him and his wife are wanting kids. I have met his cousin and the wife and they are great people and would also be amazing parents. 

My husband brought up the topic to me a while back to see what are my thoughts on it. I didn’t give him a straight answer at the moment but the topic of fertility got brought up recently because we are also having problems with conceiving. Me and my husband have been trying for a kid for about 12 months and are starting to get anxious that something is wrong with one of us. We are going to get some fertility tests done soon to see if everything is okay.

My husband has said that if he is “normal” that he would really like to help out his cousin and I feel weird about it. Like, why my husband? There are other family members that his cousin could ask that aren’t married. There’s also sperm banks that the cousin and wife can use. And adoption is also an option. I just keep thinking, “Why my husband?” Also, why didn’t the cousin and wife talk to both of us instead of just my husband.

I just don’t know how to feel about the situation. I tried to talk to my husband about the situation a little bit but he doesn’t want to get into until he knows that he can produce children.

This whole situation is weird and I’m getting stressed out because I don’t even have my own kids yet. If I’m the one that’s infertile it would make me feel horrible that I can’t have my own kids.

I’m just looking for ways to talk to my husband about how uncomfortable I am about him potentially being a sperm donor.


Edit: For those saying my husband is sleeping or wants to sleep with the wife, doubt it. The cousin lives on the opposite side of the country from us. My husband and his cousin rarely see each other and the last time they saw each other (apart from a few months ago) was 7 years ago so I wouldn’t say they’re super close. Also, I wouldn’t say my husband hit the genetic lottery for those saying that the cousin picked him for his genetics. There’s a lot of heart/ kidney problems with his side of the family so there’s a risk of possibly our child having them too. 

I’ve read the comments so far and I do plan to sit down and have a serious talk with my husband soon. I just need to get my thoughts in order.

kocam kuzenlerinden biri tarafından sperm donörü olmam istendi kuzeni genetik olarak kısırlık hastası ve kendisi ve karısı çocuk istiyor kuzeniyle ve karısıyla tanıştım ve harika insanlar ve ayrıca harika ebeveynler olabilirler

kocam bir süre önce bu konuyu bana açtı, bu konudaki düşüncelerimin ne olduğunu görmek için ona şu anda net bir cevap vermedim ama doğurganlık konusu yakın zamanda gündeme geldi çünkü biz de gebe kalma konusunda sorun yaşıyoruz ben ve kocam yaklaşık aylardır çocuk sahibi olmaya çalışıyoruz ve birimizde bir sorun olduğundan endişelenmeye başladık yakında doğurganlık testleri yaptıracağız her şeyin yolunda olup olmadığını görmek için

kocam normalse kuzenine yardım etmek istediğini söyledi ve bu konuda garip hissediyorum, kocamın neden kuzeninin evli olmayan başka aile üyeleri var ayrıca kuzen ve karısının kullanabileceği sperm bankaları var ve evlat edinme de bir seçenek sadece kocamın neden kuzen ve karısının sadece benimle değil de ikimizle de konuşmadığını düşünmeye devam ediyorum koca

durum hakkında nasıl hissedeceğimi bilmiyorum, kocamla durumu biraz konuşmaya çalıştım ama çocuk sahibi olabileceğini bilene kadar bu konuya girmek istemiyor

bu durum çok garip ve henüz kendi çocuklarım bile olmadığı için strese giriyorum, eğer kısırlık sorunum varsa kendi çocuklarım olmayacağı için kendimi çok kötü hissederim

sadece kocamla sperm donörü olma ihtimali konusunda ne kadar rahatsız olduğumu konuşmanın yollarını arıyorum

kocamın karısıyla uyuduğunu veya uyumak istediğini söyleyenler için edit, bundan şüpheliyim kuzenim ülkenin bizden karşı tarafında yaşıyor kocam ve kuzeni nadiren görüşüyorlar ve en son birkaç ay önce dışında yıllar önce görüşmüşlerdi, bu yüzden çok yakın olduklarını söyleyemem ayrıca kuzeninin onu genetiği için seçtiğini söyleyenler için kocamın genetik piyangoyu kazandığını söyleyemem ailesinde çok fazla kalp ve böbrek sorunu var, bu yüzden çocuğumuzun da bunlara sahip olma riski var

şimdiye kadar yorumları okudum ve oturup bir şeyler yapmayı planlıyorum yakında kocamla ciddi bir konuşma yapacağım sadece düşüncelerimi toparlamam gerekiyor"
I feel so embarrassed saying this. my bf did cheat on me 2 months ago it was a mistake i forgave him and everything. After i found out and read through the texts (nothing explicit or even sexual) i got turned on. I have no idea why it just does. i’m afraid of what it means for me. Do I even bring this up?  i think of him cheating on me i get turned on. I don’t want that please help me. I obviously don’t want him cheating on me. I just don’t want to get turned on thinking about it. How do i make it stop?,"Bunu söylemekten çok utanıyorum, erkek arkadaşım aylar önce beni aldattı, bir hataydı, öğrendikten ve mesajları okuduktan sonra onu ve her şeyi affettim, açık veya cinsel hiçbir şey yoktu, tahrik oldum, neden olduğunu bilmiyorum, sadece benim için ne anlama geldiğinden korkuyorum, bunu gündeme getirmeli miyim, beni aldattığını düşünüyorum, tahrik oluyorum, bunu istemiyorum, lütfen bana yardım edin, açıkça onun beni aldatmasını istemiyorum, sadece bunu düşünerek tahrik olmak istemiyorum, bunu nasıl durdurabilirim?"
"I just need to make sure that this doesn't change anything in our friendship, cause as far as I know she's straight, but I'm pretty open about being bisexual. I literally just made this as an alt account so she wouldn't see me posting and asking for help lol   
Is it normal to get messages like this from friends?  

Upd: I was gonna say 'what about the female version?' As suggested, but she deleted the message- she deleted it like 10 mins after sending it to me though so is that weird?","sadece bunun arkadaşlığımızda hiçbir şeyi değiştirmediğinden emin olmam gerekiyor çünkü bildiğim kadarıyla o heteroseksüel ama ben biseksüel olduğumu açıkça söylüyorum bunu sadece bir alternatif hesap olarak açtım böylece beni gönderi yaparken ve yardım isterken görmesin lol 
arkadaşlardan böyle mesajlar almak normal mi 

güncelleme önerildiği gibi kadın versiyonu hakkında ne diyecektim ama o mesajı sildi, bana gönderdikten birkaç dakika sonra sildi bu garip mi"

Sorry for the very nsfw questions, I’m having trouble posting at any more appropriate subs with a throwaway account. 

I’ve been talking to a guy long distance for a while and we are planning to travel to meet up soon. No guarantee but I’m guessing we’ll have sex for the first time.

He has given me a heads up that he is below average size, which I’m not worried about for my pleasure, and he doesn’t seem particularly insecure about. 

But I have a fear I won’t be tight enough for him. I think I’ve only been with people around average sized and I’ve never had any complaints, so maybe I’m being a little irrational. I just hear some women say sometimes they can’t feel as much if the guy is smaller so I’m worried it might work the other way, where he won’t feel as much sensation.

I just want to make sure he has a great time. If you have any tips on techniques or positions that work best for smaller sizes I’d love to hear them. I’m more confident that I’ll be able to give him great head but I want intercourse to be enjoyable for him too. 

I should probably ask him directly and I’m sure I will make sure all is well after but I don’t want to come across as neurotic as I honestly am because he is so chill and cool lol. Thank you so much for reading. ","çok nsfw sorular için özür dilerim, tek kullanımlık hesaplarla daha uygun alt yazılara gönderi yapmakta zorluk çekiyorum

uzun mesafeli bir adamla bir süredir konuşuyorum ve yakında buluşmak için seyahat etmeyi planlıyoruz, garanti yok ama sanırım ilk kez seks yapacağız

ortalamanın altında bir boyutta olduğunu söyledi, bu benim zevkim için endişelenmiyorum ve o da özellikle güvensiz görünmüyor

ama onun için yeterince yakın olmayacağım konusunda bir korkum var sanırım sadece ortalama boyutta insanlarla birlikte oldum ve hiç şikayetim olmadı bu yüzden belki biraz mantıksız davranıyorum sadece bazı kadınların bazen erkek daha küçükse çok fazla hissedemediklerini söylediklerini duyuyorum bu yüzden tam tersi şekilde çalışıp çok fazla his hissetmeyebileceğinden endişeleniyorum

sadece harika vakit geçirmesini sağlamak istiyorum, daha küçük boyutlar için en iyi işe yarayan teknikler veya pozisyonlar hakkında ipuçlarınız varsa onları duymayı çok isterim ona harika bir oral yapabileceğimden daha eminim ama onun için de cinsel ilişkinin keyifli olmasını istiyorum

muhtemelen ona doğrudan sormalıyım ve tabi ki her şeyin yolunda olduğundan emin olacağım ama dürüst olmak gerekirse o kadar rahat ve sakin ki nevrotik biri olarak görünmek istemiyorum lol okuduğunuz için çok teşekkür ederim"

I was a chubby kid, by kid I mean about 8-13. I’m 15 now so I’ve gotten a lot taller and slimmed down a lot. I would say I’m just normal size. But until about 10 minutes ago I didn’t believe that. I was convinced that I was really fat, no matter how much my family told me I wasn’t. 

When I was chubby I got told I was fat all the time, especially by my family. I heard it practically every day, in every argument and any time my mum wanted to feel better about her weight she would compare herself to me. Even though she was much bigger than me, she’s always make us compare bodies in the mirror and try to find something to comment on. My oldest memory of her is one of the first times she called me fat.

So naturally when my family try to tell me now that I’m not fat, I don’t believe them. Why would I? I know in my head that I’m a lot thinner than I used to be. I can see that I’m smaller, that I’m not fat. But it just felt like a lie, I didn’t believe what I saw. But for some reason no matter how much weight I lost I always thought I was obese. Genuinely. And I would see it every time I looked in the mirror, even when my stomach had barely any fat. 

Today I accidentally saw my reflection, I wasn’t expecting it and I think that’s what threw me off. When I saw my body from the side something snapped in my head and I just said “Holy shit, I’m not actually fat. Like not at all.”. I don’t know what happened but something randomly changed and I’m so confused on why. If you asked me 15 minutes ago I would have said that I was really fat. But now I can’t see that at all… because I’m not fat. I’d just never believed or realised it. I just stood there in shock for a few minutes trying to comprehend what happened and I still don’t know. 

Seriously, what the hell happened?","Çocukken tombul bir çocuktum, yani şimdiki halimden bahsediyorum, çok uzadım ve çok zayıfladım, normal boyutta olduğumu söyleyebilirim ama birkaç dakika öncesine kadar buna inanmıyordum, ailem ne kadar şişman olmadığımı söylese de gerçekten şişman olduğuma ikna olmuştum

tombul olduğumda özellikle ailem tarafından her zaman şişman olduğum söylenirdi, bunu neredeyse her gün her tartışmada duydum ve annem kilosu hakkında daha iyi hissetmek istediğinde, benden çok daha büyük olmasına rağmen kendini benimle karşılaştırırdı, her zaman aynada vücutlarımızı karşılaştırmamızı ve yorum yapacak bir şeyler bulmamızı sağlardı, onunla ilgili en eski anım, bana ilk kez şişman demesiydi

dolaysıyla ailem şimdi bana şişman olmadığımı söylemeye çalıştığında doğal olarak onlara inanmıyorum, neden inanayım ki? kafamın içinde eskiden olduğumdan çok daha zayıf olduğumu biliyorum, şişman olmadığımı ve daha küçük olduğumu görebiliyorum ama bu sadece bir yalan gibi geldi, gördüklerime inanmadım ama nedense ne kadar kilo verirsem vereyim, gerçekten obez olduğumu düşündüm ve bunu gördüm her aynaya baktığımda karnımda neredeyse hiç yağ yokken bile

bugün yanlışlıkla yansımamı gördüm beklemiyordum ve sanırım beni şaşırtan şey vücudumu yandan gördüğümde kafamda bir şey şakladı ve sadece vay canına dedim aslında hiç şişman değilim ne olduğunu bilmiyorum ama rastgele bir şey değişti ve neden birkaç dakika önce sorsaydın gerçekten şişman olduğumu söylerdim ama şimdi bunu hiç göremiyorum çünkü şişman değilim sadece inanmadım ya da fark etmedim sadece orada şok içinde birkaç dakika durdum ne olduğunu anlamaya çalıştım ve hala bilmiyorum

"I'm in my early-mid 30s, and I'm a Navy veteran. As a result of an injury on deployment, I walk with a pretty noticeable and pronounced limp when I walk. I use a wheelchair on bad days, which, for some reason, I find less embarrassing. The VA has encouraged me to use a cane when I walk, but I just cannot bring myself to. 

 But when I say noticeable, I really mean it. I saw a new doctor for the first time on Monday, and the first thing she said was, ""Wow! That's a bad limp."" I feel like people are constantly staring at me and judging me for being (relatively) young and walking with a limp like this. 

It's hurt my confidence a lot, and it's been years since the injury. Surgeries and PT have made it so I can walk, but I'm probably going to have the limp the rest of my life.

How do I just get over the mental block and say this is who I is, and stop feeling so judged constantly? ","20'li yaşlarımın başlarındayım ve bir donanma gazisiyim, görev sırasında geçirdiğim bir yaralanma sonucu oldukça belirgin ve belirgin bir aksama ile yürüyorum, kötü günlerde tekerlekli sandalye kullanıyorum ve bunu nedense daha az utanç verici buluyorum, va yürürken baston kullanmam için beni teşvik etti ama kendimi buna zorlayamıyorum

ama belirgin derken gerçekten kastettiğim şey pazartesi günü ilk kez yeni bir doktora göründüm ve söylediği ilk şey vay canına bu kötü bir aksama oldu, insanların sürekli bana baktığını ve nispeten genç olmama ve böyle aksama ile yürümeme yargıladıklarını hissediyorum

bu özgüvenimi çok zedeledi ve yaralanma ameliyatları ve fizyoterapistler sayesinde yürüyebilmem yıllar aldı ama muhtemelen hayatımın geri kalanında aksama yaşayacağım

"I matched this person online, and we've been texting back and forth a little while.  I figured if she matched and messaged me she was a least a little interested in me. However, it's like pulling teeth when we try and have a conversation. I'm always trying to keep the conversation going, but eventually I start running out of ways to keep it going. Sometimes I end up staring at my phone for several minutes because I can't think of anything else to say. They give me nothing to work with. I always try and respond to every message I get, because I know how crappy it feels to be left on delivered/read. Yet with this person, their responses are so dry I eventually can't think of anything to say back. How do you deal with these situations?

  
Update- Hi everyone, WOW!!! I did not expect this amount of replies. I've tried to keep up with all of them but I just couldn't. There were some very helpful comments and no so helpful comments. I'll say a thank you to those who answered honestly and tried to be helpful. To the trolls, I say, boo to you lol. Since I cant keep up with all the replies I will try my best to address them here in this update.

I should have mentioned in the original post, After we matched within the first few texts, she did ask me ""So, what are you looking for""? I replied ""I sent you an invite, because not only do I think you're very attractive, I really liked your profile and it seems we have a lot in common. I'd like an opportunity to take you to dinner and get to know each other a bit better"". She said ""That's nice, I do think we may have a lot in common but I'm not ready to just meet up with someone online. Lets just chat as friends and see if we build a connection from there"". 

I thought that was fair, and agreed. So we began chatting but almost instantly after her texts were very unhelpful and very short. Like if she wanted to see if we could build a connection, I began to feel like it was going to have to be me that builds it. 

Lastly, many people, many have suggested to just walk away, don't say anything and cut her off. I'm just not interested in that approach. I know some people decide to ghost/disappear but I don't like doing that. Of all the advice I received the most helpful was to just be direct and try to explain to her, how I feel about her responses and ask her if there is a way to help her be more comfortable. To see if she is even interested in continuing to speak to me at all. I'll update again after we chat. 

Final Update- Hello all, again. Thank you for all the feedback,tips, and insight from the actually helpful people. For the trolls? You all are L7- losers! 😆.  

I texted her last night and asked if she had a moment to chat. She said she did. I followed the advice of a lot of you and told her exactly how I felt, in as friendly a way I could think of. Now, a lot of you alluded to the answer. One of you predicted it word for word. I'm sorry to that one user. I wanted to give you a shout-out, but the comment has since become buried, and I can not find it. 

Turns out she just wasn't interested. She told me there is a guy she is talking to, and anytime a notification popped up, she was annoyed to see it was me and not him.

I thanked her for her honesty. Then I asked, ""If that's the case. Why not tell me? Why offer to be ""friends"" and see if anything develops""? She just said, ""Because that's just not what people do."" I said back, ""I see, well. I don't really think there is much left to say. I say we call it here, and best of luck to you. "" 
The next thing she said really made me stumble. She wrote back, ""Well I mean youre just not what usally into physically (im very fat and very short), but just because I'm not interested now, it doesn't mean that can't change. It's your job to make me interested. "" I wrote back. ""I'd rather spend my energy on someone that likes me, instead of someone that may someday. I think we're done. "" I unmatched her, and after sleeping on it.

I decided I'm just a bit too naive for the dating scene in 2024 because I don't understand matching and texting someone I have no interest in. So, I deleted my account and uninstalled the app. Thanks to everyone who tried earnestly to help out. Sometimes, things just don't work out.","bu kişiyi çevrimiçi olarak eşleştirdim ve bir süre mesajlaştık, eğer eşleşirse ve bana mesaj atarsa ​​en azından benimle ilgilendiğini düşündüm ancak bir sohbet etmeye çalıştığımızda diş çektirmek gibi oluyor, her zaman sohbeti sürdürmeye çalışıyorum ama sonunda devam ettirmenin yolları tükeniyor bazen başka bir şey söyleyemediğim için birkaç dakika telefonuma bakıyorum bana çalışacak hiçbir şey vermiyorlar her zaman aldığım her mesaja cevap vermeye çalışıyorum çünkü teslim edilmeden bırakılmanın ne kadar kötü hissettirdiğini biliyorum ama bu kişiyle ilgili yanıtları o kadar kuru ki sonunda geri söyleyecek hiçbir şey düşünemiyorum bu durumlarla nasıl başa çıkıyorsunuz

güncelleme herkese merhaba vay canına bu kadar çok yanıt beklemiyordum hepsini takip etmeye çalıştım ama başaramadım çok yardımcı yorumlar da vardı ve pek de yardımcı olmayan yorumlar da vardı dürüstçe cevap veren ve trollere yardımcı olmaya çalışanlara teşekkür edeceğim size yuhalıyorum lol tüm yanıtları takip edemediğim için bu güncellemede onlara yanıt vermek için elimden geleni yapacağım

i orijinal gönderide bahsetmeliydim, ilk birkaç mesajda eşleştikten sonra bana ne aradığını sordu, ben de sana bir davet gönderdim çünkü sadece çok çekici olduğunu düşünmüyorum, profilini gerçekten beğendim ve çok ortak noktamız var gibi görünüyor, seni yemeğe çıkarmak ve birbirimizi biraz daha yakından tanımak için bir fırsat istiyorum, güzel dedi, ortak noktalarımız olabileceğini düşünüyorum ama sadece çevrimiçi biriyle buluşmaya hazır değilim, sadece arkadaş olarak sohbet edelim ve oradan bir bağ kurup kuramayacağımıza bakalım

bunun adil olduğunu düşündüm ve kabul ettik, bu yüzden sohbet etmeye başladık ama mesajlarından hemen sonra çok yardımcı olmadı ve çok kısaydı, sanki bir bağ kurup kuramayacağımızı görmek istiyormuş gibi hissetmeye başladım, bunu kuracak olanın ben olmam gerektiğini hissettim

son olarak birçok kişi sadece uzaklaşmayı, hiçbir şey söylememeyi ve onu kesmeyi önerdi, sadece bu yaklaşımla ilgilenmiyorum, bazı insanların hayalet gibi kaybolmaya karar verdiğini biliyorum ama bunu yapmayı sevmiyorum, aldığım tüm tavsiyeler arasında en faydalı olanı sadece doğrudan olmak ve ona karşı hislerimi açıklamaya çalışmaktı yanıtlar ve ona daha rahat olmasına yardımcı olmanın bir yolu olup olmadığını sorun, benimle konuşmaya devam etmekle ilgilenip ilgilenmediğini görmek için sohbet ettikten sonra tekrar güncelleme yapacağım

son güncelleme herkese tekrar merhaba, troller için gerçekten yardımsever insanlardan gelen tüm geri bildirim ipuçları ve içgörüler için teşekkür ederim, hepiniz kaybedensiniz

dün gece ona mesaj attım ve sohbet etmek için bir anı olup olmadığını sordum, olduğunu söyledi, birçoğunuzun tavsiyesine uydum ve ona tam olarak ne hissettiğimi düşünebildiğim en samimi şekilde anlattım, birçoğunuz cevaba değindi, biriniz kelimesi kelimesine tahmin etti, o kullanıcı için üzgünüm, sana bir bağırış atmak istedim ama yorum o zamandan beri gömüldü ve bulamıyorum

görünüşe göre sadece ilgilenmiyordu, bana konuştuğu bir adam olduğunu söyledi ve her bildirim çıktığında bunun ben değil de o olduğunu görünce sinirleniyordu

dürüstlüğü için ona teşekkür ettim, sonra eğer durum buysa neden bana arkadaş olmayı teklif edip bir şey olup olmayacağını söylemediğini sordum, sadece bunun sadece insanların yaptığı gibi değil dedim geri anladım gerçekten söylenecek fazla bir şey kaldığını düşünmüyorum diyorum burada konuşalım ve sana bol şans
söylediği bir sonraki şey beni gerçekten tökezletti iyi yazdı yani sen normalde ilgilendiğin gibi değilsin fiziksel olarak çok şişmanım ve çok kısayım ama şimdi ilgilenmiyor olmam bunu değiştiremeyeceğin anlamına gelmiyor beni ilgilendirmek senin işin geri yazdım enerjimi bir gün benden hoşlanan birine harcamaktansa harcamayı tercih ederim sanırım bitti onu eşleşmeden çıkardım ve uyuduktan sonra

sadece flört sahnesi için biraz fazla saf olduğuma karar verdim çünkü ilgilenmediğim biriyle eşleşmeyi ve mesajlaşmayı anlamıyorum bu yüzden hesabımı sildim ve uygulamayı kaldırdım içtenlikle yardım etmeye çalışan herkese teşekkürler bazen işler yolunda gitmiyor"
"I'm a single Dad and my amazing little girl is four. If I'm honest, this is a question I think about quite a bit because when I was fifteen, I was at my cousin's thirteenth birthday party at a bowling alley and she got her first period. Her parents weren't there, so because we were close growing up, she called my phone and asked me to come to the bathroom quickly and when I got there she told me she had blood in her underwear. I had already done Sex Ed and since it's a co-ed school, we learned the basics together so I knew what it was but I didn't know enough to fully explain it other than, it's normal and it means your body is changing. There was a shop over the road that was a clothes shop and supermarket in one so I ran over to get a pair of tracksuit bottoms, wet wipes and a plastic bag for the clothes she had on. She got changed while I told her friends who had noticed her prolonged absence that she had an issue, had to change her clothes and asked them not to mention it and when my cousin came back the party continued as normal and she told her mother that night about everything. 

As I've been watching my daughter grow, it's something I've thought about time and again. My SIL could teach her in an ideal world but she and my brother live abroad and we mainly talk through Skype and this, to me at least, feels a bit too personal for a Skype call so I've been debating researching it and educating myself so when the time comes, I can help her better than with my cousin because I kept myself looking calm to keep her calm but internally, I was a bit panicked mainly because I didn't understand it.

What is everyone's opinions on this and any input would be appreciated.","bekar bir babayım ve harika küçük kızım dört yaşında dürüst olmak gerekirse bu çok düşündüğüm bir soru çünkü on beş yaşındayken kuzenimin bowling salonundaki on üçüncü doğum günü partisindeydim ve ilk adetini gördü ailesi orada değildi bu yüzden büyürken yakın olduğumuz için telefonumu aradı ve hemen tuvalete gelmemi istedi ve oraya vardığımda bana iç çamaşırında kan olduğunu söyledi zaten cinsel eğitim almıştım ve karma bir okul olduğu için temelleri birlikte öğrendik bu yüzden ne olduğunu biliyordum ama normal olduğunu ve vücudunuzun değiştiği anlamına geldiğini dışında tam olarak açıklayacak kadar bilgim yoktu yolun karşısında bir giyim mağazası ve süpermarket bir arada olan bir dükkan vardı bu yüzden koşarak bir eşofman altı, ıslak mendil ve üzerindeki kıyafetler için bir plastik torba aldım o sırada üstünü değiştirdi ben de uzun süreli yokluğunu fark eden arkadaşlarına bir sorunu olduğunu söyledim kıyafetlerini değiştirmek zorunda kaldım ve bundan bahsetmemelerini istedim ve kuzenim geri döndüğünde parti normal şekilde devam etti ve o gece annesine her şeyi anlattı 

kızımı izliyordum büyümek bunun üzerine defalarca düşündüm, ablam ona ideal bir dünyada öğretebilirdi ama o ve kardeşim yurtdışında yaşıyor ve çoğunlukla skype üzerinden konuşuyoruz ve bu bana en azından skype görüşmesi için fazla kişisel geliyor bu yüzden araştırmayı ve kendimi eğitmeyi düşünüyorum böylece zamanı geldiğinde ona kuzenimden daha iyi yardım edebilirim çünkü kendimi sakin tutmaya çalıştım ama içten içe biraz panikledim çünkü çoğunlukla anlamadım

"My 18 year old son talks to himself constantly and he always has. It has gotten much more frequent over he years. Lately, in the past year, roughly, it has progressed quite a bit. His bedroom is down in the basement and alot of the time, i can hear jom talking loudly to homself down there as if he is talking to others. He was diagnosed with adhd in grade one but his dad and I always firmly believed he showed more signs of being on the autism spectrum.  He has never had many friends and would be considered a geek. 
He is really into transformers and Lego and games on his phone. He just graduated high school. I am raising him and his sister alone now, his dad died 6 months ago. He also lost his grandpa whom we lived with a year ago. I am getting pretty worried that there is something big wrong and I am failing him. I am going to try to convince him to get some councelling re. His dad and grandpa. Can anybody relate to anything I am experiencing with him? Any suggestions or thoughts would be appreciated.

"My boyfriend just told me that he gets the ick when I’m soft toward him. For reference, I said I missed him because he’s on on a business trip and he mentioned that while that specifically wasn’t overdoing it, it did make him cringe a little. Apparently the closest he gets to the full blown ick is when I’m lovey-dovey which sucks because I’m a huge softie and we have a really tumultuous relationship so when it’s good I really like to be affectionate. Is this a sign that he has lost feelings? I can’t imagine rejecting his affection. His way of affection is bringing me my favorite snacks or through sex, he rarely shows me words of affirmation or is sweet toward me but he’s just a very closed off person. Do you think this is just a guy being a guy or is there more behind his statements?


EDITING TO ADD:
This isn’t a new relationship, it’s been 2 years and we have been through pretty significant trauma together which is outlined in my first couple posts. He has always gone through waves of hot and cold. Sometimes he’s brings flowers, writes love notes but admittedly it’s scarce and when I ask why, it causes an argument or he has valid reasons like that he doesn’t think I deserve it because I drink which he despises. He was the kindest and most affectionate when I was pregnant (until we lost the baby) which I think shows he’s not a bad guy. Also, a lot of comments are saying he’s using me for sex but he is rarely the one to instigate, he has said from the beginning of our relationship that he does not need sex to be happy. If he truly didn’t like me, wouldn’t he just breakup with me? What is there to gain from staying with me?","erkek arkadaşım bana ona karşı yumuşak davrandığımda iğrendiğini söyledi referans olarak, onu özlediğimi söyledim çünkü bir iş gezisindeydi ve bunun özellikle abartı olmadığını ancak onu biraz ürküttüğünü söyledi görünüşe göre tam teşekküllü iğrenmeye en çok yaklaştığı zaman, çok yumuşak huylu olduğum ve gerçekten çalkantılı bir ilişkimiz olduğu için, bu kötü bir şey, bu yüzden iyi olduğunda gerçekten şefkatli olmayı seviyorum, bu duygularını kaybettiğinin bir işareti mi, onun sevgisini reddetmeyi hayal edemiyorum, onun şefkat yolu bana en sevdiğim atıştırmalıkları getirmek veya seks yoluyla, bana nadiren onaylayıcı sözler gösteriyor veya bana karşı tatlı davranıyor ama o sadece çok kapalı bir insan, bunun sadece bir erkeğin erkek gibi davranması olduğunu mu düşünüyorsun yoksa ifadelerinin arkasında başka bir şey mi var

"On Saturday, my friend (19F) and I (19M) got really drunk and wound up having sex. It was a pretty mediocre experience for the both of us and I believe we both regret it. We briefly spoke about it in person the next day, saying that neither of us wanted anything more and neither of us liked each other, but I could tell she was a little uncomfortable about the whole thing despite her saying otherwise. If I'm being completely honest, I think there are still romantic feelings lingering on both sides of the fence, but I don't think either of us are willing to be completely honest with each other about those feelings. I believe it's that unwillingness for complete transparency that has made this whole situation more awkward than it need be. I texted her yesterday (it was very casual, some stupid inside joke), but she ignored me. I've thought about reaching out again, but I haven't because I feel like I should give her some space. I really don't want to lose her as a friend, as I feel like I could be myself when I'm with her and I always enjoy talking to her. I'm scared of losing her and I feel like a shitty friend for ruining a good thing. Should I try reaching out again or just let things be for now? Is it even worth it to try being friends again or do you guys think I should cut my losses?

UPDATE: Hung out with her for a bit tonight with a friend of mine, everything was actually pretty normal, no weird vibes at all.

Well, I'm a 37y/o male and I've been living with my partner, female 35 y/o for the past 2 years.


Important information: we are both asexual. This is relevant in order for everyone to understand why this didn't came up earlier...
Also another important information: my partner is really sensitive about her past: any smallest mention of it tends to end up with a nervous breakdown. I learned to simply avoid the subject and everything was peachy until yesterday...


We both tend to respect our privacy, be it bathing, changing or whatever... But yesterday I messed up: I completely forgot that a friend was supposed to pick me up for a night out in the city- gaming can be a blessing or a curse... Being in the middle of a game trans I get a phone call from my buddy asking when I'll be out coz he was waiting for like half an hour in front of the house (7 unread messages). I told him to give me 5min and I'll be out.


Not waisting any more time I barged into our bedroom to get a hoodie and my shoes and what I stumbled upon shook me to my core:
My partner was in the middle of getting dressed with only her bra and underwear on. 


Her entire back and legs were/are covered in scars... It was only a short glimpse but oh my goodness...
I'm mortified... I'm lost for words... I'm shocked...


Today she said that I've violated her privacy yesterday, that she can't trust me anymore and that she needs some time for herself alone and away from me to rethink the relationship between the two of us.


Here is where I need advice: should I try and get in touch with her? Give her space? And most importantly: what to do and how to proceed forward with what I saw? Any advice would be appreciated.



Update: 
Ok ppl, I'm outta here for now. Gonna meet up with my partner in about an hour in our fav restaurant.
Bought out half of the florist's stock so fingers crossed and wish me luck.","peki ben bir yo erkeğim ve son yıllarda partnerim kadın yo ile yaşıyorum

"I (22M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) for about a year now, and she recently told me that she doesn't find me physically attractive; she likes me, but she doesn't find me physically or sexually attractive. She said she was always trying to date a handsome man, but she couldn't. And she said she didn't want to be alone forever, so she ""lowered her standards."" 

And ""settled"" for me, she wanted a boyfriend, so she decided to go out with me even though she doesn't think I'm handsome or good-looking. I find her very attractive, and I am aware that I'm not handsome on a scale of 1–10.

 I'm like a 4 or a 5, which isn't that attractive. I'm aware of that, but it did hurt when she told me she didn't find me attractive. I told her I knew I was not handsome, and she said, ""I know, and it's okay."" I'm not sure what to do.

ve benimle yetindi, bir erkek arkadaş istiyordu, bu yüzden benimle çıkmaya karar verdi, beni yakışıklı veya iyi görünümlü bulmasa da onu çok çekici buluyorum ve bir ölçekte yakışıklı olmadığımın farkındayım

"UPDATE: I’m just going to ghost her. Not the most ideal thing to do but she has been blowing my phone up telling me how much she misses me, and she took it as far as posting about me on social media (shit escalated quickly). I appreciate everyone’s advice. I owe her nothing 🤷🏼‍♂️ we never even met in person. But i will say that not all single parents are bad and this shouldn’t be looked at as the reason not to date one. I am a firm believer in getting to know someone for a good minute, child or not, before inviting them into your home. Again i didn’t want to ghost because i try not to live like an asshole. The past 2 years have been the most peaceful time of my life and I’m trying to maintain it. I am no angel and in the past i have made questionable decisions when dealing with people, but that’s a story for another day. I see now that to protect myself and home sometimes you still gotta be the asshole. 

Been talking to this girl for about 2 weeks. During that time of getting to know each other i was in the process of buying a house (i am now moved in). We were talking otp the other day and she was talking about how she wanted to remodel my home and was talking about how she has wanted to move into a neighborhood like mine her whole life. Saying she wanted to come stay with me and cook for me. This was odd to me since we haven’t been on a date yet and that she has a daughter (not a issue at all just weird that she wants to stay in my house when i have not been properly introduced to her daughter.) I am honestly kind of turned off by this. She’s a good looking woman and so far is very kind, but something just seems off about this. I can’t help but look at the red flags in this situation. She doesn’t have a job (lives with her sister), already hinting at moving in, plus she’s been calling me baby. Idk if i sound like an asshole but I’m keeping my guard up because as much as i want a relationship I’m not desperate and honestly don’t want to financially compromise myself after seeing these red flags. Any advice on how to approach her?

"I (31) have a 13 year old daughter.

My friend (Friend A, 35) sent me a message last week saying they are going camping (but not real camping, they won't be staying in tents but in a chalet) and would like to invite me and my daughter.

Her husband and three children (ages 12, 8 and 5) are also going, including a mutual friend (Friend B, 42) who will also be going with her husband and child (age 10). It will be three nights by a beautiful lake in a valley, 4 hours drive away.

I said I am working therefore I cannot go, and asked if they want to include my daughter to their trip. She immediately said ""Sure, she can come.""

I have told my daughter this and she was excited because she has always wanted to visit the place they're going to.

Then Friend A and Friend B met up for coffee and they simultaneously send me a message that they are not going to the camp anymore, and will be cancelling the trip because the weather is not looking good according to the forecast.

Therefore they said my daughter cannot go with them. So I said fine.

I had to break the news to my daughter that the trip was called off. She was sad at first but she said it's okay, she can just stay at home and read her books.

Then all of a sudden I see Friend A's sister post photos on Facebook that they have indeed gone for the trip (the weather is not so bad, just cloudy).

If they told me that they cannot include my daughter with pure honesty, that will be so much better, rather than lying.

I  understand, they might find it difficult having to look after her but she's very well behaved and very mature for her age. She can even help them look after their smaller children.

Are they still good friends despite this?

Should I distance myself from them from now on? (Although this is difficult because we see each other nearly every week because the three of us are members of the same country club and well-being spa).

Because if the situation is reversed, I would be very much willing to take their children with me. I am very close to their children too.

Do I have a right to be upset and hurt?
I feel like they dislike my daughter because she is very shy. She is a good kid, but she is just shy.

TL;DR Friends said they cancelled a trip which they initially agreed on including my daughter with them, therefore telling me they won't take her with them anymore. Then turns out they didn't really cancel the trip and went.

EDIT: Added the TL;DR","bir yaşında kızım var

arkadaşım arkadaşım geçen hafta bana kamp yapmaya gittiklerini ama gerçek kamp yapmayacaklarını, çadırda değil bir şalede kalacaklarını ve beni ve kızımı davet etmek istediklerini söyleyen bir mesaj attı

kocası ve üç çocuğu da gidiyor ve ortak bir arkadaşımız olan arkadaş b de kocası ve çocuğuyla birlikte gidecek, bir vadide güzel bir göl kenarında üç gece olacak, saatlerce araba sürecek

çalıştığımı ve gidemeyeceğimi söyledim ve kızımı gezilerine dahil etmek isteyip istemediklerini sordum, hemen gelebileceğini söyledi

bunu kızıma söyledim ve çok heyecanlandı çünkü her zaman gidecekleri yeri ziyaret etmek istemişti

sonra arkadaş a ve arkadaş b kahve içmek için buluştular ve aynı anda bana kampa gitmeyeceklerini ve hava durumu tahminlere göre iyi görünmediği için geziyi iptal edeceklerini söyleyen bir mesaj gönderdiler

bu yüzden kızımın onlarla gelemeyeceğini söylediler, ben de tamam dedim

kızıma gezinin iptal edildiğini söylemek zorunda kaldım, ilk başta üzüldü ama sorun değil, sadece gelebileceğini söyledi evde kal ve kitaplarını oku

sonra aniden kız kardeşim olan bir arkadaşımın facebook'ta geziye gittiklerine dair fotoğraflar paylaştığını gördüm hava o kadar da kötü değil sadece bulutlu

eğer bana kızımı dahil edemeyeceklerini dürüstçe söyleselerdi yalan söylemekten çok daha iyi olurdu

onunla ilgilenmek zorunda kalmalarının zor olabileceğini anlıyorum ama o çok iyi huylu ve yaşına göre çok olgun, hatta küçük çocuklarına bakmalarına bile yardımcı olabilir

buna rağmen hala iyi arkadaşlar mı

bundan sonra onlardan uzaklaşmalı mıyım, ancak bu zor çünkü neredeyse her hafta birbirimizi görüyoruz çünkü üçümüz de aynı country club ve wellbeing spa'nın üyesiyiz

çünkü durum tersine dönerse çocuklarını da yanıma almaya çok istekli olurum, çocuklarına da çok yakınım

üzgün ve incinmiş olmaya hakkım var mı
kızımı çok utangaç olduğu için sevmiyorlarmış gibi hissediyorum o iyi bir çocuk ama sadece utangaç

kısacası arkadaşlarım başta kızımı da dahil etmeyi kabul ettikleri geziyi iptal ettiklerini söylediler bu yüzden bana katılmayacaklarını söylediler artık onlarla birlikte değiller, sonra aslında seyahati iptal etmedikleri ve gittikleri ortaya çıktı

"M34 caught my W32 sexting with another man on a secret TIkTOK account she uses. In 2014 I caught her sexting an old manager / boyfriend and it took a lot out of me. I truly loved her and  felt betrayed and lied to. My wife did everything she could to keep this “fling” hidden. I came home early and could hear her saying sexual things and I just stood in the living room and picked up what I could. When confronted she said “our relationship was new and she is confused.” At that time we had just moved in together ,she was a bartender and her boss was an older married man. Judging by the conversation and text messages at that time I believe they were meeting up at a local park late into the night. When I found that out it felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest. I still loved her but we had a lease and neither of us was in a position to go anywhere. I never truly forgave her for that and I’m sure my behavior changed. I have no doubt my love for her shifted but we eventually moved on. 10 years went by and we have two wonderful sons. I work full time in finance and she is a stay at home mom. Two years ago we moved from Atlanta to Pittsburgh neither of us have any family or friends in the city. Last night I noticed her on her phone way more than usual, I checked her phone when she wasn’t looking and realized she has a TikTok page where she initiates sexual comments to I assume strangers and takes the conversation to the DMs. This time when confronted she told me “I don’t pay enough attention to her.” I feel this taking a toll on my confidence in myself and I can’t afford that again.

"  My bf (M30) and I (F31) have been dating since last July. We met on an online dating app were he messaged me first and set a date right away. Things were good and he obviously told me he was in the states on a student visa. I was hesitant at first given that I already have a child of my own and only wanted to have a relationship with someone who I could build a stable future with. He has been the first and only bf that I’ve introduced to my son and they got along great. I was so happy because my son loves him and my bf does treat him well. 

    Fast forward to now, my bf is from Thailand and at the end of last year he said he need to go back home to renew his visa and wanted me to go with him to meet his family. We made the trip in March and things were still ok, I met his family and they were all nice. On our 3day trip to Phuket which he paid for himself for just the two of us he asked me to marry him. I got caught in the moment and said yes, it was a very emotional moment for me as it has been my dream to get married and build a family. But then I got sad because I realized he never talked to my parents about asking to marry me which I specified to him in the early stages of dating that in my culture asking the daughters hand in marriage is a big thing, he also didn’t ask any advice from friends or told them about it neither so it felt like my friends and family were left out and he only included his. 

 I also started feeling like things were a bit rushed because again, he hadn’t graduated school yet (graduates in June) had no job and we had been dating for less than a year. Well to make things worse that same night he told me he wanted to talk to me about something and proceeded in asking for me to file papers for him to get his citizenship. He obviously saw the look of shock on my face and started telling me that I didn’t have to worry about the money or the filing because he would take everything, he said he wanted to be able to find a job so he can provide for me and my son and give us a good life. I gave him the ring back and told him I just wasn’t ready and needed to think about things. 
    
  I’m so confused as to what I should do. Should I follow my gut feeling and just end the relationship? I don’t want to be used and ever since then my feelings for him have changed and now I have a wall built up. I don’t want to be with someone who wants to use me, especially since now my son is involved which is what makes me more anxious because my son really likes my bf and is always asking about him. He has even mentioned to me that he doesn’t want me to break up with him. What do you guys think?

ayrıca işlerin biraz aceleye getirildiğini hissetmeye başladım çünkü yine okuldan mezun olmamıştı haziran ayında mezun olanların işi yoktu ve bir yıldan az bir süredir çıkıyorduk işleri daha da kötüleştirmek için aynı gece bana bir şey hakkında konuşmak istediğini söyledi ve vatandaşlık alabilmesi için evrakları hazırlamamı istedi yüzümdeki şok ifadesini açıkça gördü ve bana para veya evrak konusunda endişelenmeme gerek olmadığını çünkü her istediğini alacağını söyledi bir iş bulabilmek için bana ve oğluma bakabilmek ve bize iyi bir hayat sunabilmek için yüzüğü ona geri verdim ve ona hazır olmadığımı ve bazı şeyler hakkında düşünmem gerektiğini söyledim 

ne yapmam gerektiği konusunda çok kafam karışık içgüdülerimi kullanıp ilişkiyi bitirmek istiyorum, kullanılmak istemiyorum ve o zamandan beri ona karşı hislerim değişti ve şimdi bir duvar ördüm, özellikle oğlum da dahil olduğu için beni kullanmak isteyen biriyle olmak istemiyorum, bu da beni daha da kaygılandırıyor çünkü oğlum erkek arkadaşımı gerçekten seviyor ve sürekli onun hakkında sorular soruyor, hatta benimle ayrılmamı istemediğini bile söyledi, siz ne düşünüyorsunuz?"

Im not a virgin but i still bled on this guys dick (not on my period) and the whole time we were doing it i was just so not turned on and it just felt like something going in and out of me. i just wanted him to cum fast so it could end. So why do I get so horny but then feel nothing during actual intercourse?,dün bir adamla buluştum ve arabasıyla ateşli bir ilişkiye girdik ve sanki onu becermek istiyormuşum gibi çok tahrik oldum ama penisini içime aldığım anda nasıl hissettiğimden nefret ettim bakire değilim ama yine de bu adamın penisine kanıyordum adet dönemimde değil ve bunu yaptığımız süre boyunca hiç tahrik olmamıştım ve sanki bir şey içime girip çıkıyormuş gibi hissettim sadece onun hızlıca boşalmasını istiyordum böylece bitebilirdi peki neden bu kadar azgınlaşıyorum ama gerçek bir ilişki sırasında hiçbir şey hissetmiyorum

I asked my mum and she said ‘boys want their girlfriend to dress up and be pretty, pjs in public looks sloppy and trashy’. I have very few clothes which I feel comfortable wearing, I really am trying hard to find more stylish clothes which I like but I find it so difficult. I usually wear oversized joggers and a hoodie or jumper, I do not consider these my pjs but many people do. I struggle a lot with my personal appearance and there are very few clothes that I look good in. I want to be pretty and I thought that my clothes weren’t too bad before but now I am a bit scared  to go outside because I don’t want to be perceived as weird. Is it bad to wear pjs in public?

Edit: I do not sleep in the clothes I wear out in public, the joggers and hoodie that I always wear in public I do not wear at home. 

Edit 2: Thank you to everyone who took the time to reply, it has really helped and I should have probably  clarified some things.
1- I am a very hygienic person, my hygiene is something I take pride in. I shower 3 times a day (sounds excessive but I cannot be productive when I don’t feel clean) I always make sure the clothes I do wear are clean and I take time to do my skincare and dental care routines. 
2- I don’t go out in these clothes for special occasions, but I do go out in them for every other reason, such as shopping, going to the library and usually college as I’m out of the house for longer that 12 hours for that.

Edit 3: Ok I feel like some people are getting the wrong idea about my reasons for wearing joggers and a hoodie in public. I am not lazy when it comes to getting ready, I just don’t know what to wear. I was made fun of the clothes I wore last year to college (cargos and oversized fleeces, maybe not the best choice but it was  comfortable and made me feel less insecure) so I stopped wearing them as much, 16 year old me gave up on trying to dress nicely I guess. Now I’m trying to find new clothes to feel more comfortable and confident in which don’t look like shit. Any advice or recommendations on comfy clothes which look good are welcome and very much appreciated :)","Az önce halk içinde pijama giymek isteyen bir kız hakkında bir yazı okudum ve erkek arkadaşı bundan hoşlanmamış tüm yorumlar bunun özensiz ve saçma olduğunu söylüyordu anneme sordum ve erkeklerin kız arkadaşlarının giyinmesini ve güzel olmasını istediğini söyledi halk içinde pijamalar özensiz ve çirkin görünüyor kendimi rahat hissettiğim çok az kıyafetim var gerçekten daha şık kıyafetler bulmaya çalışıyorum ve bunları seviyorum ama çok zor buluyorum genelde büyük eşofman altı ve kapüşonlu üst veya kazak giyiyorum bunları benim pijamalarım olarak görmüyorum ama birçok kişi görüyor kişisel görünümümle çok mücadele ediyorum ve iyi göründüğüm çok az kıyafet var güzel olmak istiyorum ve kıyafetlerimin önceden de fena olmadığını düşünüyordum ama şimdi dışarı çıkmaktan biraz korkuyorum çünkü garip olarak algılanmak istemiyorum halk içinde pijama giymek kötü mü

"Me and my friend met a few years ago and lately, she’s gotten too comfortable with me. She keeps touching me inappropriately and I tell her to stop doing it and to fuck off, yet she keeps doing it and it makes me fucking pissed. I don’t know what to do and I’m obviously pissed off. Exams for me are soon and it’s making me even more annoyed since I’m stressed half the time.  She touches me inappropriately broad daylight like I’m a doll or some shit. She says the weirdest shit like ‘I’m going to touch you where the sun don’t shine.’ It’s super childish and I legit want to punch her in the fucking face.

I sit next to a guy who is *genuinely* for a lack of better words, repulsive. He always leans forwards and farts, he constantly smells like a public toilet that hasn’t been cleaned for years, I’m ninety nine percent sure he has lice and I don’t think he even wears any underwear because his asscrack is always out.

It’s genuinely disturbing me now and I don’t know what to do. I can’t move seats because our class is full, and we barely know each other either. It makes me feel ill the entire lesson and it honestly makes me want to pick a different subject.

I, 24F, am in the midst of a contentious divorce/custody battle with my soon to be ex husband, 25M. I am a veteran, and my husband was Active Duty until he was arrested for his horrific strangulation and assault of me in May 2024. I fled from California to another state to avoid him “finishing the job”. He has already pled guilty to the felony domestic violence assault. He was sentenced recently to just probation and a buttload of classes, as long as he honors the permanent restraining order and stays clean on probation. Any violation results in immediate jail time of six months. He only pled guilty after hearing prosecution was flying me out to testify in person.

This man has been abusing me and cheating on me our entire relationship and marriage. The abuse got so bad that he escalated to strangling me so badly my lips busted open and my pupils were ‘incorrect’ for days afterward. After this assault in May, he was arrested, charged, and I got to leave the state without issue.

Now here we are, back in court for divorce and custody. Despite his felony conviction and clear inability to stay sober (he admitted he was only 4 days sober at the time of court when I had been gone for over 3 months), they are trying to force me to return to California one a month for one weekend of every month, including a holiday schedule. That’s simply not financially feasible for me.

My ex husband refuses to give me any money in child support. He was active duty, and now he is being separated for his assault upon me. He has moved into the home of the woman he was cheating on me with the entirety of his deployment, and has bought her a ring! LOL

Our next court date is coming up, and I have been unable to serve him with the divorce summons because I don’t know his address, and not everyone can get to his workplace on base. The police department can’t do it because I was denied a court fee waiver. 

I’m at my wit’s end. Honestly. I truly don’t even know what to say to any of this lol. I’m so sick of it and wish to God he would just give me the fucking divorce! He already has a new female!!!! Like? 

Any advice, feel free to drop in the comments.

"My friend group (all 19F) won’t stop talking about my weight and it’s driving me crazy. For context, I am a bit on the curvier side (5’6 186 lbs) compared to my friends (≈5’3 110 lbs). 

Recently whenever I grab a snack, they say “are you really sure about that?”, or something else to that effect. And when I question it they just tell me they’re “trying to look out” for my health. 

Even today, after we had just arrived in the airport and all eaten chic fil a I wanted to get a sweet treat so I bought a Kit Kat. When one of my friends saw me eating it she asked me how far I walked to get it. When I told her 6 minutes she said, “of course you’d walk so far for that”. When I asked her what she meant, she just said she was happy that she was tiny so that she didn’t have to eat as much as me. 

It feels like it’s always like this too. They’ll make jokes about me being a “big back”, and laugh about how much I eat. But if I complain about it, I’m just overly sensitive and insecure. 

The most annoying part about the whole thing is that I’ve been trying to work on my weight too. Just this summer I became pescatarian, started going on runs, and lost 15 pounds. But nobody interested in making jokes or talking about that. 

There’s also another girl in our friend group who has the exact same build as me, but nobody ever makes fun of her. I just don’t really understand how the way I look is their business. 

Should I have a conversation with my friends about their comments or just keep it to myself and let it be gym motivation? Please tell me what I should do. 

P.S. sorry for the word vomit, I’m not the best writer and I just wanted to get everything down. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I’m a D1 athlete, so I’m also pretty muscular.

"So I’m f and there’s a guy I’ve been talking to and last night we went back home and things started escalating and we were kissing and then taking our clothes off. When I got all of mine off, he started going lower, and I think he was planning on going down on me but he stopped and said “hey…I have an idea” then rolled me over onto my stomach and before I could really object, I suddenly felt him licking my anus.

It was…such an effing strange sensation. Like, it didn’t feel that good but also not unbearable? It kinda feels the way calamari does when you hold it, except…in my butt. I just kinda lied there like a deer in headlights and had no idea what to do (I could've told him to stop, I know) but after what felt like a while, I guess he interpreted my silence as me not being into it and he asked why I wasn’t enjoying it. I just told him it didn’t feel that good and it must’ve bruised his ego because he wanted to stop after that. So we got our clothes back on and then he left a little after. I know he was being a child so I probably won’t be calling him back.

So…I guess one question: am I still a virgin? Idk if “tongue in the butthole” counts but that’s a really awkward way to lose it and a really awkward sexual history to exclusively have performed that act. Next question…am I a baby for feeling mortified that another person has seen my asshole? I’ve always been very shy around that part of me and I feel my anus’ presence is something that embarrasses me easily when it comes to sex, so I just don’t love that someone knows what it looks like.

(ps I do not consider this sexual assault. I consider it an attempt to be spontaneous that just really didn’t land)

EDIT: GOD GUYS STOP MESSAGING ME PLEASE","yani ben f ve orada konuştuğum bir adam var ve dün gece eve döndük ve işler tırmanmaya başladı ve öpüşüyorduk ve sonra tüm kıyafetlerimi çıkardığımda daha aşağı inmeye başladı ve sanırım bana oral yapmayı planlıyordu ama durdu ve hey bir fikrin var dedi sonra beni karnımın üzerine çevirdi ve gerçekten itiraz edemeden aniden anüsümü yaladığını hissettim

çok garip bir histi, sanki o kadar iyi hissettirmiyordu ama aynı zamanda dayanılmaz da değildi, kalamar tuttuğunuzda hissettiği gibi hissettiriyordu, kıçımı hariç tutuyordum, sadece farlara bakan bir geyik gibi orada yattım ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyordum, ona durmasını söyleyebilirdim, biliyorum ama bir süre sonra sanırım sessizliğimi bundan hoşlanmadığım şeklinde yorumladı ve neden bundan hoşlanmadığımı sordu, ona sadece bunun iyi hissettirmediğini ve egosunu incitmiş olması gerektiğini söyledim çünkü bundan sonra durmak istedi, bu yüzden kıyafetlerimizi tekrar giydik ve sonra biraz sonra gitti, biliyorum ki çocukça davranıyordu, bu yüzden muhtemelen onu geri aramayacağım

yani sanırım bir soru hala bakire miyim bilmiyorum dilin kıç deliğinde olması sayılır mı ama bu onu kaybetmenin gerçekten garip bir yolu ve sadece bunu yapmış olmak gerçekten garip bir cinsel geçmiş sonraki soru bir bebek olduğum için başka birinin kıç deliğimi görmüş olmasından utanıyorum her zaman o kısmımın etrafında çok utangaç oldum ve seks söz konusu olduğunda anüsümün varlığının beni kolayca utandırdığını düşünüyorum bu yüzden birinin nasıl göründüğünü bilmesini sevmiyorum

"So my GF cheated on me at a pub and lied to my face about it multiple times when confronted. She was crying telling me how sorry she and banging her head one stuff the night I found out. I was worried about her safety so I didn't want her to go back to hers on her own. She stayed at mine and she told me how sorry she was and how guilty she felt over and over. She begged me to stay and I decided to. Anyway since then she's been fine other then her normal meltdowns and arguments with me, but no cheating or anything like that. But still to this day it causes me so much anxiety when I'm apart from her. I just wonder what if she is cheating and lying to me.

Is it still valid reason for me to break up with her after all this time?","kız arkadaşım beni bir barda aldattı ve yüzüme karşı defalarca yalan söyledi, yüzleştiğimde ağlayarak bana ne kadar üzgün olduğunu söyledi ve kafasını bir yere vurdu, öğrendiğim gece onun güvenliğinden endişe ediyordum, bu yüzden kendi başına evine dönmesini istemedim, benimkinde kaldı ve bana ne kadar üzgün olduğunu ve ne kadar suçlu hissettiğini söyledi, benden kalmamı istedi ve ben de kalmaya karar verdim, o zamandan beri normal çöküntüleri ve benimle tartışmaları dışında iyi ama aldatma veya buna benzer bir şey yok ama yine de bugün bile ondan ayrı olduğumda çok fazla kaygıya neden oluyor, sadece ya beni aldatıyorsa ve bana yalan söylüyorsa diye merak ediyorum

I am a 22yr old female and My mom 45f and my sil 19f have had a little drama going on that started with my mom kissing her grandchild on the forehead (sil’s baby). Sil shared a post a facebook about not kissing babies a few weeks ago but had never made this boundary clear verbally with anyone.  I know some people think not kissing babies is common knowledge but I can assure you that not everyone is aware of this. My brother 24m, sil, and the baby came to visit for the first time in 2-3 weeks (they visited multiple times before this happened) and my mom was excited to see the baby and kissed her on the forehead. My brother and sil did not say or do anything. We visited for awhile longer and the three of them went home and about an hour later my mom received a text message on fb from sil stating that she did not want her kissing baby and that she will not get access to her anymore for crossing her boundaries. Then she deleted my mom on fb. My mom apologized and promised she wouldn’t do it again. 
Since then, they haven’t came to visit and my brother and sil had gotten into an arguments about my mom (I know because he came to sleep here for a night and she posted a picture of all his stuff thrown on the sidewalk). Sil made posts on fb saying that if anyone crosses her boundaries that they will not get access to her baby. My mom has tried apologizing again and reaching out asking them to come visit or to come over for thanksgiving to introduce baby to her other family members like her great great grandmother and her great grandparents but my brother and sil ignored her messages and did not come to visit. That was a few weeks ago and they still haven’t came to visit. This morning my mom tried to message my brother to see if he needed some money for gas or anything but realized that she was blocked. she came and told me and she was holding back tears. This honestly broke my heart and she’s now considering cutting off my brothers phone that she pays for and I told her to do it. But I’m just wondering if anyone has advice on how to make this situation better?
 Just to be clear my mom did not see sil’s photo she shared about not kissing the baby. My mom has fb but is not on it often. 

Edit: some people are asking if my mom and sil had any issues prior to this situation and I’m not aware of any issues they had except one thing I just remembered (sorry this just came to me) but when the baby was born 3 months ago, everyone was visiting at the hospital, sil told us that she did not want anyone to post about the baby before her (she wanted to be the first to post the baby) but my mom was not at the hospital because she is paralyzed from the waist down and was unable to go to the hospital (transportation reasons) so she didn’t get the message to not post the baby, My brother even sent pictures of the baby but did not tell her about sil’s wishes.  my mom had made a post to share with her friends that she was a grandmother. Sil was obviously mad about this but she forgave my mom for it. The communication between them hasn’t been great tbh (also sil is 20 I was wrong) 

Adding a comment I made because I don’t think much people saw it. Brother and sil definitely don’t have a healthy relationship. I don't like to involve myself in others relationships but my niece is involved now and i was just looking for advice on what I can do. I can't control if they choose to stay together or not and I can’t control what my mom does, I just don't want my niece to be affected badly by anyone's decisions or mistakes or whatever. I reached out to sil letting her know that her feelings are valid and I completely understand where she's coming from and that I'll continue to help her whenever I can. But I'm no longer gonna involve myself with this situation. My mom is sad about the outcome but I’ll always be there for her and I’ll give her another grand baby one day so she can shower them with all the love she wants. My relationship with my mom, my brother and sil is good and I hope to keep it that way. Thank to you everyone for your comments and helpful advice I’m doing my best to read everyone’s response :) ","ben bir yaşında bir kızım ve annem ve kayınvalidem arasında küçük bir dram var, annem torununu alnından öptüğünde başladı, sils bebek sil birkaç hafta önce facebook'ta bebekleri öpmemek hakkında bir paylaşım yaptı ama bu sınırı hiç kimseye sözlü olarak belirtmedi, bazı insanlar bebekleri öpmemenin genel bir bilgi olduğunu düşünüyor ama sizi temin ederim ki herkes bunun farkında değil, kardeşim, sil ve bebek haftalardır ilk kez ziyarete geldi, bu olmadan önce birkaç kez ziyaret ettiler ve annem bebeği görünce heyecanlandı ve alnından öptü, kardeşim ve kayınvalidem hiçbir şey söylemedi veya yapmadı, bir süre daha ziyaret ettik ve üçü eve gitti ve yaklaşık bir saat sonra annem fb'den sil'den bebeğini öpmesini istemediğini ve sınırlarını aştığı için bir daha ona erişemeyeceğini belirten bir mesaj aldı, sonra annemi fb'den sildi, annem özür diledi ve bir daha yapmayacağına söz verdi
o zamandan beri ziyarete gelmediler ve kardeşim ve kayınvalidem annem hakkında tartıştılar, biliyorum çünkü buraya uyumaya gelmişti gece ve kaldırıma atılmış tüm eşyalarının bir resmini paylaştı sil fb'de eğer biri sınırlarını aşarsa bebeğine erişemeyeceğini söyleyen paylaşımlar yaptı annem tekrar özür dilemeye çalıştı ve onlara gelip ziyaret etmelerini veya şükran günü için gelip bebeği büyük büyük büyükannesi ve büyük büyük anneannesi ve büyük büyükbabası gibi diğer aile üyeleriyle tanıştırmalarını istedi ama kardeşim ve sil mesajlarını görmezden geldi ve ziyarete gelmedi bu birkaç hafta önceydi ve hala gelmediler bu sabah annem kardeşime benzin parası veya başka bir şey için paraya ihtiyacı olup olmadığını sormak için mesaj atmaya çalıştı ama engellendiğini fark etti gelip bana söyledi ve gözyaşlarını tutuyordu bu gerçekten kalbimi kırdı ve şimdi ödediği ve yapmasını söylediğim kardeşimin telefonunu kesmeyi düşünüyor ama sadece bu durumu nasıl daha iyi hale getirebileceğim konusunda birinin tavsiyesi olup olmadığını merak ediyorum
sadece açık olmak gerekirse annem sils'in bebeği öpmediğiyle ilgili paylaştığı fotoğrafı görmedi annem fb'ye sahip ama sık sık kullanmıyor

düzenle bazı insanlar annem ve sil'in bu durumdan önce herhangi bir sorun yaşayıp yaşamadığını soruyor ve herhangi bir sorun yaşadıklarını bilmiyorum sadece bir şey hariç hatırladığımı üzgünüm bu aklıma geldi ama aylar önce bebek doğduğunda herkes hastanede ziyarete gelmişti sil bize kendisinden önce kimsenin bebek hakkında paylaşım yapmasını istemediğini söyledi bebeği ilk paylaşan olmak istiyordu ama annem belden aşağısı felçli olduğu için hastanede değildi ve hastaneye ulaşım nedeniyle gidemiyordu bu yüzden bebeği paylaşmaması gerektiği mesajını almadı kardeşim bebeğin fotoğraflarını bile gönderdi ama ona sils'ten bahsetmedi keşke annem arkadaşlarıyla paylaşmak için bir paylaşım yapsaydı ve büyükanne olduğunu söyleseydi sil buna çok sinirlendi ama annemi affetti aralarındaki iletişim pek iyi olmadı ayrıca sil ben yanılmışım

çok fazla insanın görmediğini düşündüğüm için yaptığım bir yorumu ekliyorum kardeşim ve sil kesinlikle sağlıklı bir ilişkiye sahip değil başkalarının ilişkilerine karışmayı sevmiyorum ama yeğenim artık dahil ve sadece ne yapabileceğim konusunda tavsiye arıyordum birlikte kalıp kalmayacaklarını kontrol edemem ve annemin ne yapacağını kontrol edemem sadece yeğenimin etkilenmesini istemiyorum Herhangi birinin kararları veya hataları veya başka bir şey yüzünden Sil'e ulaştım ve ona duygularının geçerli olduğunu ve nereden geldiğini tamamen anladığımı ve ne zaman mümkün olursa ona yardım etmeye devam edeceğimi bildirdim ancak artık bu duruma kendimi dahil etmeyeceğim. Annem sonuçtan dolayı üzgün ama her zaman onun yanında olacağım ve bir gün ona bir torun daha vereceğim böylece istediği tüm sevgiyi onlara gösterebilecek. Annemle, kardeşimle ve Sil'le olan ilişkim iyi ve böyle devam etmesini umuyorum. Yorumlarınız ve faydalı tavsiyeleriniz için hepinize teşekkür ederim, herkesin yanıtını okumak için elimden geleni yapıyorum."
One night I was drunk and I sent a video of myself pissing to a group chat with 3 male friends as a joke. A girl saw it twice and my friends said she wanted to forget the image of my thing in her head. 2 days ago my friend brought up the situation as a joke but unironically I felt shame when I remembered what I have done. I talked myself out of the topic. But should I talk with the girl about the video or should I just ignore the shame. Then I feel awful when I think about it. Maybe a few people know how to deal with these types of situations.,bir gece sarhoştum ve kendimin işeme videosunu erkek arkadaşlarımla bir grup sohbetine şaka olarak gönderdim bir kız bunu iki kez gördü ve arkadaşlarım kafasındaki şeyin görüntüsünü unutmak istediğini söyledi birkaç gün önce arkadaşım durumu bir şaka olarak gündeme getirdi ama ironik olmayan bir şekilde yaptığımı hatırladığımda utanç hissettim kendimi konudan uzaklaştırdım ama video hakkında kızla konuşmalı mıyım yoksa utancı görmezden mi gelmeliyim sonra bunu düşündüğümde kendimi çok kötü hissediyorum belki birkaç kişi bu tür durumlarla nasıl başa çıkılacağını biliyordur
"I need some advice...

My brother in law is a grade A pervert who used to go around openly grabbing men's crotches and touching them inappropriately (licking faces, slapping asses, etc). For years we were told ""That's just BIL"" and the entire family turned a blind eye, including my wife. When I tried to stand up for myself I was belittled and treated like I was causing problems. 

My FIL has justified it as ""he wasn't being maliciuous"" and ""that's what guys do"" (aka locker room behavior). Eventually it all came to a head and during an argument my wife had me falsely arrested, then went on a PR campaign making me seem like a monster (she neglected to tell people that I walked away 3 times from the argument and she followed me until my temper boiled over) I even called her mother to ask her to get her away from me to avoid it. 

Flash forward.. I am now shunned from any family events and the entire family treats me like an abuser. I don't tell my wife she can't see her family, but I obviously have major concerns about my two boys being around my BIL. Not only did he physically do what he did, he went out of his way to convince my wife that I was unstable and unfit to be a father (while he physically and emotionally abused his wife and adopted son)

My wife sees no issue leaving me out to dry and being alone most holidays. My father in laws 70th birthday party was this past weekend and I was literally the only person not invited. I told my wife that her friends would be there and I could be civil, as I was not comfortable with my kids there. She basically lied and said it was only family and her dad's friends (not true). Then she posted pictures on social media of her and all her friends, their husbands and all the kids together.... she hid the post from me and my closest friends. I found out when my brother asked me how the party was and said he saw the posts online.

How would you handle this? My wife is never wrong, never admitted fault and has essentially never apologized for her behaviors and throwing me under the bus. Her family simply wrote me off as if I didn't exist and still dote on my BIL like he's some awsome human being. I'm personally sick of being lied to and played for a fool. She will claim she blocked the post so ""I wouldn't get angry"" which is a total gas light.

I honestly think I should just leave and move on with my life. Im dreading the divorce and her family lying to make me lose custody of my kids. HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH A FAMILY OF FULL FLEDGED NARCISSISTS?","biraz tavsiyeye ihtiyacım var

Bize bunun sadece sapıklık olduğu söylendi ve tüm aile görmezden geldi, karım da dahil olmak üzere kendimi savunmaya çalıştığımda küçümsendim ve sorun çıkarıyormuşum gibi davranıldı

kayınpederim bunu haklı çıkardı, kötü niyetli değildi ve erkeklerin yaptığı şey budur, yani soyunma odası davranışları sonunda her şey patlak verdi ve bir tartışma sırasında karım beni haksız yere tutuklattı sonra beni bir canavar gibi göstererek bir halkla ilişkiler kampanyasına başladı, insanlara tartışmadan kaçtığımı söylemeyi ihmal etti ve öfkem taşana kadar beni takip etti, hatta annesini arayıp ondan uzaklaşmasını istedim, bundan kaçınmak için

şimdi herhangi bir aile etkinliğinden dışlanıyorum ve tüm aile bana bir tacizci gibi davranıyor, karıma ailesini göremediğini söylemiyorum ama iki oğlumun kayınvalidemin yanında olmasından açıkça endişeleniyorum, sadece fiziksel olarak yaptığını yaptı mı? Eşimin dengesiz ve baba olmaya uygun olmadığımı ikna etmek için elinden geleni yaptı, oysa kendisi karısına ve evlat edindiği oğluna fiziksel ve duygusal olarak şiddet uyguladı

Eşim beni dışarıda bırakıp çoğu tatilde yalnız kalmakta bir sorun görmüyor kayınpederimin doğum günü partisi geçen hafta sonuydu ve davet edilmeyen tek kişi bendim. Eşime arkadaşlarının orada olacağını ve çocuklarımın orada olmasından rahatsız olduğum için medeni olabileceğimi söyledim. Temelde yalan söyledi ve bunun sadece aile ve babasının arkadaşları olduğunu söyledi. Doğru değil. Sonra sosyal medyada kendisinin ve tüm arkadaşlarının, kocalarının ve tüm çocuklarının birlikte olduğu fotoğrafları paylaştı. Gönderiyi benden ve en yakın arkadaşlarımdan sakladı. Kardeşim partinin nasıl geçtiğini sorduğunda ve gönderileri internette gördüğünü söylediğinde öğrendim.

Bunu nasıl halledersiniz? Eşim asla yanılmaz, asla hatasını kabul etmez ve davranışları ve beni otobüsün altına atması için asla özür dilemez. Ailesi beni yokmuşum gibi görmezden gelir ve hala harika bir insanmış gibi babama düşkündür. Şahsen bana yalan söylenmesinden bıktım ve aptal yerine kondu, sinirlenmemem için gönderiyi engellediğini iddia edecek, bu da tamamen bir gaz lambası

dürüst olmak gerekirse, sadece gitmem ve hayatıma devam etmem gerektiğini düşünüyorum, boşanmaktan ve ailesinin çocuklarımın velayetini kaybetmem için bana yalan söylemesinden korkuyorum, tam teşekküllü narsisistlerden oluşan bir aileyle nasıl başa çıkarsınız"
"
While driving home from a long day at work today I saw a 2-3 year old girl watching videos on a cell phone and running down the side walk on a very busy 45 MPH road. 

There were no adults around and she was running into the intersection when I realized this was bad, parked my car in the turn lane and got out to catch her.

Luckily another two drivers stopped and helped wrangle this girl into the car to keep her safe and away from traffic. The girl was non-verbal, in a diaper, with  no shoes. 
 
We put the little girl in the back seat and I sat with her while we drove to a nearby parking lot where we’d be safe from traffic. The little girl was completely oblivious to the whole encounter and I realized in the car that she smelled like feces and had bandages around her entire chest under the shirt. 

While we waited for the cops to show up, the mom came running looking for the girl. She seemed reasonably upset and didn’t give me bad vibes, but I can’t help but worry about the girl. 

The PD showed up right after the family was reunited and they took the mom’s address and information. None of us who found the girl told the cop about the bandages or smell. 

I know NOTHING about children so I don’t know if my gut is overreacting, or if this is actually a sketchy situation where I should follow up with the authorities about the girl. Do you think CPS will make a house call?

If it matters, this happened in California, USA. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who responded to give me advice!  I called Cps and updated the police. The CPS officer sounded concerned. I’m honestly pretty disturbed by the situation and am grappling with a lot of emotions. I really hope nothing is wrong and it was a bad day for the family. I’m hoping CPS will find everything is okay and give the mom some resources to help out with the little girl. For some reason, I feel like the bad guy calling CPS, but my gut is telling me something isn’t right.
","bugün işten eve dönerken bir yaşında bir kızın cep telefonuyla video izlediğini ve çok yoğun bir mil hızındaki yolda kaldırımda koştuğunu gördüm

etrafta hiç yetişkin yoktu ve kavşağa doğru koşuyordu, bunun kötü olduğunu fark ettiğimde arabamı dönüş şeridine park ettim ve onu yakalamak için dışarı çıktım

neyse ki iki sürücü daha durdu ve bu kızı güvende tutmak ve trafikten uzak tutmak için arabaya bindirmeye yardım ettiler kız ayakkabısız, bezli ve konuşamayan bir kızdı

küçük kızı arka koltuğa koyduk ve yakınlardaki bir otoparka giderken yanında oturdum, orada trafikten güvende olacaktık küçük kız tüm karşılaşmadan tamamen habersizdi ve arabada dışkı gibi koktuğunu ve gömleğinin altında tüm göğsünün bandajlarla kaplı olduğunu fark ettim

polislerin gelmesini beklerken anne koşarak kızı aramaya geldi, oldukça üzgün görünüyordu ve bana kötü hisler vermedi ama kız için endişelenmekten kendimi alamıyorum

polis memuru aile bir araya geldikten hemen sonra geldi ve annenin adresini ve bilgilerini aldılar, kızı bulanlardan hiçbiri polise bandajlardan veya kokudan bahsetmedi

çocuklar hakkında hiçbir şey bilmiyorum, bu yüzden içgüdülerimin aşırı tepki verip vermediğini veya bunun aslında kız hakkında yetkililerle görüşmem gereken şüpheli bir durum olup olmadığını bilmiyorum, sizce CPS bir ev ziyareti yapar mı?

önemliyse bu Kaliforniya ABD'de oldu

düzenleme bana tavsiye vermek için yanıt veren herkese teşekkür ederim, CPS'yi aradım ve polise bildirdim, CPS memuru endişeli görünüyordu, dürüst olmak gerekirse durumdan oldukça rahatsızım ve birçok duyguyla boğuşuyorum, gerçekten bir sorun olmadığını umuyorum ve aile için kötü bir gündü, CPS'nin her şeyin yolunda olduğunu bulmasını ve anneye küçük kıza yardım etmesi için bazı kaynaklar sağlamasını umuyorum, nedense CPS'yi arayan kötü adam gibi hissediyorum ama içgüdülerim bana bir şeylerin doğru olmadığını söylüyor"
"My sister is nasty. She has this insane jealousy with me and is always trying to expose my insecurities to the world. 

For some reason, she thinks I have a small penis because of this 1 picture that was taken when I was 18. I’m wearing sweatpants and it was freezing out, so obviously my “junk” wasn’t in prime form and it’s piercing through my pants. Not a great look. 

Anyway, I wake up on my 25th birthday and she posted the pic on her Instagram story for everyone to see. I was fuming and she just laughed when I asked her to take it down. 

How the fuck do I deal with this kind of behavior? For the record, my “junk” is actually on the larger side and I’m sick of the pervert activity from her. 

She continues to post this pic online every now and then regardless of what I say. How do I deal with this? 


Edit: 

Wow, I did not expect this to blow up the way it did. Thanks for all the comments here. I did block her a few months ago and that did seem to do the trick with all the weird posts. I just keep limited contact now and ignore her if anything starts. 

Probably won’t pursue anything further unless she starts back up again. The picture is still on her Instagram from when it was originally posted years ago. 

","kız kardeşim iğrenç biri, bana karşı çılgınca bir kıskançlığı var ve sürekli güvensizliklerimi dünyaya ifşa etmeye çalışıyor

nedense eşofman giydiğimde ve hava buz gibiyken çekilmiş bu fotoğraf yüzünden penisimin küçük olduğunu düşünüyor, bu yüzden belli ki penisim en iyi durumda değildi ve pantolonumdan içeri giriyor, pek de iyi görünmüyor

neyse, doğum günümde uyandım ve o herkesin görmesi için instagram hikayesine fotoğrafı koydu, öfkeden köpürüyordum ve kaldırmasını istediğimde sadece güldü

bu tür davranışlarla nasıl başa çıkacağım, kayıtlara geçsin, penisim aslında daha büyük ve onun sapık hareketlerinden bıktım

ne desem de, ara sıra bu fotoğrafı çevrimiçi olarak paylaşmaya devam ediyor, bununla nasıl başa çıkacağım

"4 nights ago a kid from my hometown (i’ve known him for as long as i can remember and have been friendly,) invited me over to his house to hang out and i went. i had recently had kind of a falling out with the guy i was seeing, and was pretty vulnerable. genuinely just looking for some comfort and human connection. 

we smoked and watched tv and within 20 minutes he started kissing me, and after that he was immediately on top of me and taking my clothes off. i tried to get him to stop by saying i was on my period, and that it was because i had missed my birth control, all of which is true. it didn’t stop him, but i didn’t say the word no or express for him to stop. but i didn’t want it to happen, i knew it was a potential going over there and that i might have to tell him to stop at some point, but it happened so quick and i was physically overpowered. 

from his perspective i probably seemed like i enjoyed it i guess? it lasted an hour and the whole time i just prayed it was going to stop soon. he was really rough, left bruises all over me, and literally was biting my skin. once it finally stopped, i should have left. but in all honesty, i didn’t realize i was assaulted until today. 

he offered to smoke again, and we tried to watch tv again. within probably 10 minutes he was touching me and it happened again, and probably lasted longer, itwas even more uncomfortable for me. he pressured me to do it this time without a condom because he “couldn’t finish without one.” he also said he would pay for my abortion so he could just finish inside me knowing that my birth control wasn’t effective. he asked several times all of which i clearly said no to, which he eventually respected. 

my body hurt the next 2 like never before after sex but i wasn’t too concerned, until my entire lymphatic system started to swell, and i started to show some other symptoms of an STD. 

i got tested today, it’s been almost 96 hours since it happened. everyone i spoke to at the clinic suggested at least getting a rape kit even if i don’t do anything with it. i don’t know if i can even handle having a pelvic exam right now. but i’m running out of time to have it done. 

i do not know what it would accomplish, if anything i just want other girls and potential partners around him TO KNOW, but also for him to know what he did was wrong, because i don’t even know if he realizes it. 

i don’t really want to relive it in court or even the hospital. i also don’t want to ruin his life, or have it turn back on me. because it wasn’t a forcible attack, i don’t know what a rape kit can really do from a legal stand point, and it would just be my word and character, vs his. so ultimately, i don’t think it’s going to accomplish anything other than more emotional distress for me, but i absolutely do not want him doing this to other people. 

and considering how small our town is i am scared for myself, and what he has told people, or will tell people.","geceler önce memleketimden bir çocuk, hatırladığım kadarıyla uzun zamandır tanıyorum ve arkadaş canlısıyım, beni evine takılmaya davet etti ve gittim, yakın zamanda görüştüğüm çocukla biraz küsmüştüm ve oldukça savunmasızdım, gerçekten sadece biraz rahatlık ve insani bağ arıyordum

sigara içtik ve televizyon izledik ve birkaç dakika içinde beni öpmeye başladı ve bundan sonra hemen üstüme çıktı ve kıyafetlerimi çıkardı, adet döneminde olduğumu ve bunun doğum kontrolümü kaçırdığım için olduğunu söyleyerek onu durdurmaya çalıştım, hepsi doğru, onu durdurmadı ama hayır kelimesini söylemedim veya durmasını söylemedim ama bunun olmasını istemedim, bunun oraya gitme potansiyeli olduğunu ve bir noktada ona durmasını söylemem gerekebileceğini biliyordum ama çok hızlı oldu ve fiziksel olarak alt edildim

onun bakış açısından muhtemelen bundan zevk almış gibi görünüyordum, sanırım bir saat sürdü ve tüm bu süre boyunca sadece yakında durması için dua ettim, gerçekten sertti, her yerimde morluklar bıraktı ve sonunda durduğunda kelimenin tam anlamıyla cildimi ısırdı ayrılmalıydım ama dürüst olmak gerekirse bugün saldırıya uğradığımı fark etmemiştim

tekrar sigara içmeyi teklif etti ve muhtemelen birkaç dakika içinde tekrar televizyon izlemeye çalıştık bana dokunuyordu ve tekrar oldu ve muhtemelen daha uzun sürdü benim için daha da rahatsız ediciydi bu sefer prezervatifsiz yapmam için beni zorladı çünkü prezervatifsiz bitiremezdi ayrıca kürtajımı ödeyeceğini söyledi böylece doğum kontrolümün etkili olmadığını bilerek içimde bitirebilirdi birkaç kez sordu ve ben de açıkça hayır dedim ve sonunda saygı gösterdi

seksten sonra vücudum daha önce hiç olmadığı kadar ağrıdı ama tüm lenf sistemim şişmeye başlayana ve cinsel yolla bulaşan bir hastalığın başka semptomlarını göstermeye başlayana kadar çok endişelenmedim

bugün test yaptırdım neredeyse saatler oldu klinikte konuştuğum herkes en azından bir tecavüz kiti almamı önerdi hiçbir şey yapmasam bile şu anda pelvik muayene yaptırıp yaptıramayacağımı bilmiyorum ama yaptırmak için zamanım tükeniyor

başarılı olacağını bilmiyorum eğer bir şey olursa sadece başka kızlar ve potansiyel istiyorum etrafındaki ortakların bilmesini ama aynı zamanda onun da yaptığının yanlış olduğunu bilmesini istiyorum çünkü farkında olup olmadığını bile bilmiyorum

bunu mahkemede veya hastanede tekrar yaşamak istemiyorum ayrıca hayatını mahvetmek veya bana geri dönmesini istemiyorum çünkü bu zorla bir saldırı değildi bir tecavüz kitinin yasal açıdan ne yapabileceğini bilmiyorum ve bu sadece benim sözüm ve karakterim ve onun sözü ve karakteri olurdu bu yüzden sonuçta bunun benim için daha fazla duygusal sıkıntıdan başka bir şeye yol açacağını düşünmüyorum ama kesinlikle onun bunu başkalarına yapmasını istemiyorum

ve kasabamızın ne kadar küçük olduğunu düşündüğümde kendim ve insanlara söyledikleri veya söyleyecekleri için korkuyorum"
"Ok so I (17m) have a girlfriend (16f) and we recently had sex for the first time. It was my first time ever having sex and I was excited and we were sitting on her bed and started to kiss and then when things started to escalate, she repositioned and bent over the bed and pulled her pants down and said “ok go ahead.” I didn’t really know what to make of it so I just said “okay” and put it in and did my thing, and then right after I came she pulled her pants back up and then sat back down on the bed and asked what we were gonna do next.

She was pretty silent throughout the sex and I don’t think she got much enjoyment out of it. I feel bad for that but I guess I was just so overwhelmed with it being my first time I wasn’t thinking much of it. However, the fact that she was silent and just seemingly wanted to get it over with…doesn’t sit right with me. Makes me kinda worried if she had a bad experience in the past :/

Anyone have any advice? I genuinely don’t know what to do. I’m all for communication but I don’t know if I should push this time

tl;dr: girlfriend acted like she was just getting it over with when we had sex and it hasn’t sat right with me and I’m worried she may have had a bad history with sex

(PS we used a condom, just in case anyone was concerned haha)","tamam yani bir kız arkadaşım var ve yakın zamanda ilk kez seks yaptık bu benim ilk seks deneyimimdi ve heyecanlıydım ve yatağında oturuyorduk ve öpüşmeye başladık ve sonra işler kızışmaya başlayınca pozisyonunu değiştirdi ve yatağa eğildi ve pantolonunu aşağı indirdi ve tamam devam et dedi ne yapacağımı gerçekten bilmiyordum bu yüzden sadece tamam dedim ve giydim ve işimi yaptım ve sonra boşaldıktan hemen sonra pantolonunu tekrar yukarı çekti ve sonra yatağa oturdu ve bundan sonra ne yapacağımızı sordu

seks boyunca oldukça sessizdi ve bundan pek zevk aldığını sanmıyorum bunun için kötü hissediyorum ama sanırım bunun ilk seferim olması beni çok bunaltmıştı fazla düşünmüyordum ancak sessiz olması ve sadece bitirmek istiyor gibi görünmesi bana doğru gelmiyor geçmişte kötü bir deneyim yaşamış olması konusunda beni biraz endişelendiriyor

herkesin bir tavsiyesi var mı gerçekten ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum iletişimden yanayım ama bunu zorlamalı mıyım bilmiyorum zaman

kısa özet kız arkadaşın seks yaptığımızda sanki yeni bitiriyormuş gibi davrandı ve bu bana pek uymadı ve seksle ilgili kötü bir geçmişi olabileceğinden endişeleniyorum

ps endişelenen birileri varsa diye prezervatif kullandık haha"
"I’m about to marry my fiancé, who has been vegan for about 6 years and vegetarian for 9. I respect her lifestyle, and it’s never really been a problem in our relationship. I don’t hate vegan food, but I’m not vegan myself and enjoy a variety of foods, including meat.

Recently, we started planning our wedding, and my fiancé told me she wants the entire wedding to be vegan because the idea of animals dying for our celebration makes her uncomfortable. I understand where she’s coming from, but I find it unfair to be forced into not being able to eat the food I enjoy on such an important day. I’ve never said I hate all vegan food, but I believe I should have the choice to eat what I want, especially on our wedding day.

We had a discussion about it, and she offered to compromise by making the wedding vegetarian instead of fully vegan. However, I still feel like I should have the option to include some non-vegan dishes for myself and possibly other guests who might prefer them.

I’m trying to find a solution that respects her values without completely disregarding my preferences. Any advice on how to navigate this situation?","Yaklaşık yıllardır vegan olan nişanlımla evlenmek üzereyim ve vejetaryenim çünkü yaşam tarzına saygı duyuyorum ve ilişkimizde bu hiçbir zaman sorun olmadı vegan yemeklerden nefret etmiyorum ama kendim vegan değilim ve et dahil çeşitli yiyecekleri seviyorum

Son zamanlarda düğünümüzü planlamaya başladık ve nişanlım tüm düğünün vegan olmasını istediğini söyledi çünkü kutlamamız için hayvanların ölmesi fikri onu rahatsız ediyor nereden geldiğini anlıyorum ama böylesine önemli bir günde zevk aldığım yemeği yiyememeye zorlanmanın haksız olduğunu düşünüyorum hiçbir zaman tüm vegan yemeklerden nefret ettiğimi söylemedim ama özellikle düğün günümüzde istediğimi yeme seçeneğine sahip olmam gerektiğine inanıyorum

Bunun hakkında bir konuşma yaptık ve düğünü tamamen vegan yapmak yerine vejetaryen yaparak uzlaşmayı teklif etti ancak yine de kendim ve muhtemelen bunları tercih edebilecek diğer konuklar için bazı vegan olmayan yemekler ekleme seçeneğim olması gerektiğini düşünüyorum

Tercihlerimi tamamen göz ardı etmeden onun değerlerine saygı duyan bir çözüm bulmaya çalışıyorum bu durumla nasıl başa çıkabileceğime dair herhangi bir tavsiyeniz var mı"

"finally decided to ask for advice and opinions here even though i know the majority vote already lol, i just hope theres maybe a few people who have had to deal with something simular

Anyway ive been in a relationship with my boyfriend for over three years. We are extremely close and are each others best friend. We are in school together. Weve traveled together i am in love with this man and i wanted to move out with him soon

Last month in school my phone had broke so i had to use his phone to take some refrence photos for art class. As i was taking the selfies i realised i hated them and wanted them gone off of his phone. So i went to delete and then went to the “bin” folder to permantely delete them and thats when i saw them all. Photos of a woman naked, *really* naked. Which all looked like they were taken by someone. And i started having a panic attack and ran to the bathroom to get a closer look and whrn i did there was also a video of the girl and another woman on top of each other and i was so so confused. I first thought he was cheating and took the pics of the girl but now not so sure. But i did think wow the girl looks really familiar. I ran out he tried to stop and hug me but i was too panicing thats when a teacher took me away and drove me home. 

When i got home i continued panicing and when i opened snapchat web on my computer of course there was the fuck load of messages pouring in from him , suicide threats, how sorry he was but most of all. All i could see. Was his cousins name and thats when it hit me. It was his 26 year old lesbian cousin. And the video was her and her girlfriend. 

He had borrowed her phone for something at the many family events he attends and went through her camera roll. And recorded all of those nasty things on her phone with his phone.

I cut contact for a week. I couldnt eat or sleep. Ive never felt so horrible and disgusted it was like i was greiving the man i was so in love with a day prior. We had just gotten back from our first trip abroad together and i really thought we had fallen more in love

Im a massive fucking idiot and i hate myself for it but i took him back as he promised he would change and hes so sorry. I know im stupid i just cant do it i cant leave him. Whats wrong with me?

He made me promise not to tell his cousin too because it would ruin his family. But i feel so much guilt

Its still killing me . Eating away at me everyday. When we are together its all i can think about. Ive already had very bad self esteem issues and body dysmorphia for a couple of years. This made it all 10 times worse.

Please help me anyone who can understand how hard it is for me. How do i heal how do i stop thinking about this how.

Tldr: my boyfriend saved his cousins nudes to his phone and i dont know how to move forward with the relationship

Edit: thank you to all that replyed to this post.

Im getting alot of hateful and hurtful messages and comments for not telling the cousin . I completely understand it. I know its horrible to keep this from her. But please try to understand the position im in . I would really be tearing apart this incredibly close family by letting this out. It would effect so much people negatively for possible forever. And id feel guilty for that forever. I know im not doing the right thing but it was an incredibly hard desicion to make. And id be worried for the welfare of my boyfriend if i did.

Please understand i feel so guilty and horrible for keeping it from her. but with this post i was trying to find advice on how to heal myself and tips for moving forward with the relationship as ive decided im going to stay with him. And i know im stupid for it i get told enough by my family and friends . Thank you to everyone taking time to give their input.","Sonunda burada tavsiye ve görüş sormaya karar verdim, çoğunluk oyu zaten bilmeme rağmen lol umarım benzer bir şeyle başa çıkmak zorunda kalmış birkaç kişi vardır

Neyse, erkek arkadaşımla üç yıldan uzun süredir ilişkimiz var, birbirimize çok yakınız ve birbirimizin en iyi arkadaşıyız, birlikte okuldayız, birlikte seyahat ettik, bu adama aşığım ve yakında onunla birlikte taşınmak istiyorum

Geçen ay okulda telefonum bozuldu, bu yüzden sanat dersi için referans fotoğraflar çekmek için onun telefonunu kullanmak zorunda kaldım, özçekimleri çekerken onlardan nefret ettiğimi ve telefonundan silmek istediğimi fark ettim, bu yüzden silmeye gittim ve sonra onları kalıcı olarak silmek için çöp kutusu klasörüne gittim ve o zaman hepsini çıplak, gerçekten çıplak bir kadının fotoğraflarını gördüm, hepsi biri tarafından çekilmiş gibi görünüyordu ve panik atak geçirmeye başladım ve daha yakından bakmak için banyoya koştum ve bunu yaptığımda ayrıca kızın ve başka bir kadının üst üste olduğu bir video da vardı ve çok çok kafam karıştı, önce aldattığını düşündüm ve kızın fotoğraflarını çektim ama şimdi pek emin değilim ama vay canına kız gerçekten tanıdık geliyor diye düşündüm dışarı koştum durup bana sarılmaya çalıştı ama çok paniklemiştim o zaman bir öğretmen beni alıp eve götürdü

eve vardığımda paniklemeye devam ettim ve bilgisayarımda snapchat web'i açtığımda tabii ki ondan gelen bir sürü mesaj vardı intihar tehditleri ne kadar üzgündü ama en çok görebildiğim şey kuzeninin adıydı ve o zaman anladım ki bir yaşındaki lezbiyen kuzeniydi ve videoda o ve kız arkadaşı vardı

katıldığı birçok aile etkinliğinde telefonunu bir şey için ödünç almıştı ve kamera rulosunu karıştırıp telefonuyla tüm o iğrenç şeyleri kaydetmişti

bir hafta boyunca iletişimi kestim, yemek yiyemedim veya uyuyamadım hiç bu kadar kötü ve iğrenç hissetmemiştim sanki bir gün önce çok aşık olduğum adamın yasını tutuyordum birlikte ilk yurt dışı seyahatimizden yeni dönmüştük ve gerçekten daha fazla aşık olduğumuzu düşünmüştüm

ben çok büyük bir aptalım ve bunun için kendimden nefret ediyorum ama söz verdiği gibi onu geri aldım o değişirdi ve çok üzgündü biliyorum aptalım bunu yapamam onu ​​bırakamam bende sorun ne

kuzenine de söylememem için söz verdirdi çünkü ailesini mahvederdi ama çok fazla suçluluk hissediyorum

beni hala öldürüyor her gün birlikte olduğumuzda beni yiyor düşünebildiğim tek şey bu zaten birkaç yıldır çok kötü özgüven sorunlarım ve vücut dismorfisi vardı bu her şeyi daha da kötüleştirdi

lütfen bana yardım edin ne kadar zor olduğunu anlayabilen var mı nasıl iyileşirim nasıl düşünmeyi bırakırım nasıl

özetle erkek arkadaşım kuzeninin çıplak fotoğraflarını telefonuna kaydetti ve ilişkiye nasıl devam edeceğimi bilmiyorum

düzenleme bu gönderiye yanıt veren herkese teşekkür ederim

kuzenime söylemediğim için çok fazla nefret dolu ve incitici mesaj ve yorum alıyorum tamamen anlıyorum bunu ondan saklamanın korkunç olduğunu biliyorum ama lütfen içinde bulunduğum durumu anlamaya çalışın bunu açığa vurarak bu inanılmaz yakın aileyi gerçekten parçalayacağım bu çok sayıda insanı sonsuza kadar olumsuz etkiler ve bunun için sonsuza kadar suçluluk duyuyorum biliyorum ki yapmıyorum doğru şey ama inanılmaz derecede zor bir karardı ve bunu yaparsam erkek arkadaşımın refahı için endişelenirdim

"I (f26) have only had one partner , my bf (m26). Apparently according to him, I am the best he’s ever had. Also, I apparently give really good “head”. I think our sex is great, but I have nothing really to compare it to. I lost my virginity to him (we were about 23). He recently just told me that sometimes it keeps him up at night at the thought that I may have been with other men because “I can’t be that good without having experience”. He begged me to tell him the truth but I have not been with anyone else*. How do I explain to him that I guess I’m just that good? I don’t think I’m that good but he thinks I am ;-;

So my cousin and I are both in our 30s and he just told me just joined a gang. I thought he turned a corner when he became a born again Christian but apparently like a week or two ago he joined a gang. I feel bad because I scolded him for joining because he has a teenager and he's done this. Then again I should've seen this coming because of his impulsive behavior. What can I do to help him?,"kuzenim ve ben ikimiz de s'liyiz ve bana bir çeteye katıldığını söyledi, yeniden doğmuş bir hristiyan olduğunda bir dönüm noktası yaşadığını düşünmüştüm ama görünüşe göre bir veya iki hafta önce bir çeteye katılmış, onu katıldığı için azarladığım için kendimi kötü hissediyorum, çünkü bir ergen çocuğu var ve bunu yaptı, yine de dürtüsel davranışları nedeniyle bunun olacağını tahmin etmeliydim, ona nasıl yardım edebilirim?"
"So I'm friends with this guy and we are in a group chat mostly made of women. With Halloween coming up i texted for everyone to be careful, bring something like pepper spray, and to travel in groups. He started texting back saying that we could just use our fists or kick and rapist in the balls. Now, im not a very fit woman, im pretty skinny and not that strong, as is most of my friend group. I tried telling him That thats not how it works and I sent him a screen shot of an article detailing it. He responded with ""just had to prove a fucking point huh"". This specific friend has made many rape jokes in the past. Not to mention he is 6'0 and a lot stronger than I am.

"I (27f) made a friend (28m) on my flight back home yesterday and as fun as it was to live in the moment we never exchanged numbers :/

He had a Hebrew tattoo on his left arm and a palm tree on his right. Grew up in Hawaii but isn’t Hawaiian and now does some sort of renewable energy work on the islands. I don’t remember his name but think it started with a K. Whatever it was meant warrior in … Celtic? Nordic? Not 100% on that one but he was headed to Tahoe to do some snowboarding with his family.

During the flight he offered and shared Lilikoi snacks with me and the friend I was traveling with (26f). The three of us ended up talking and laughing for the majority of the flight &amp; my friend ended up watching Slumdog Millionare with him. It was the most fun I have ever had on a plane tbh. When it came time to exit the flight we all went into leaving mode and didn’t say goodbye. I won’t lie, my parents were on the flight and it made me feel nervous to ask for his number. He had family on the flight &amp; maybe might have been feeling more on the timid side as well… a girl can dream 🤞🏼

He said he has Reddit so I thought I’d try a missed connection post to reconnect. Some kind redditors on my original post suggested I try other pages so I’ve now cast this and some other lines out for the fish. I don’t know if anything will come of it but the journey has been fun!

I (26F) got drunk and slept with my boss (32M) and I don’t know what to do about it. I’ve never done anything like this before.

This past Tuesday was a really bad day at work. We got threatened with a lawsuit and on top of that everything else seemed to be going wrong. Works ends late for us. My boss and I were the last ones there. We had been talking about how we needed a drink all day long and that was going to be the first thing we both did as soon as we got home - it was just one of those days. So he invited me to go grab a drink. This isn’t super unusual for the people I work with. We all actually like each other, for the most part, and some people hang out outside of work. I’ve never gone out for a drink with him solo though.

So we went to a nearby bar. I had a few drinks. It doesn’t take too much for me to get drunk, but normally I have full control over myself…like I just don’t get that drunk that I do embarrassing things. Well, I rarely get that drunk, let’s say. Can’t claim it’s never happened. Having sex with a co-worker or a random person is definitely not something I’ve ever done when drinking.

We ended up back at his place and had sex. I slept there and the next day I could remember the details clearly enough. It was so embarrassing. I woke up at around 5 am and got an Uber back to work where my car was and went home before I had to be at work for the day on Wednesday.

On Wednesday we avoided each other the best we could and only spoke briefly when it was absolutely necessary for the job. Luckily, I had prescheduled vacation time Thursday and Friday, but I work again tomorrow. The anxiety of facing him again is making me sick. And I’m sitting here at home wondering if everyone knows. What if he told somebody?

The thing is that I was/am very attracted to him, but he was my boss so what could I do? I also could never tell if he was interested in me at all because he’s sort of aloof and it’s hard to gauge him sometimes. We got along great though and this is the best place I’ve ever worked, so I don’t want this to completely screw all of that up.

What’s the appropriate thing to do here?

I feel like I should bring it say something to him about it, but I don’t know what to say or how to bring it up. Maybe I should just not mention it and continue to let things stay awkward indefinitely, but it’s so uncomfortable. I want to just clear the air about it but what do I even say?

TL;DR: I got drunk and slept with my boss. Now things are really awkward at work. I want to talk to him about it to maybe clear the air but I don’t know how to bring it up or what to say","i f sarhoş oldum ve patronumla yattım ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum daha önce hiç böyle bir şey yapmadım

çarşamba günü birbirimizden olabildiğince uzak durduk ve sadece iş için kesinlikle gerekli olduğunda kısa bir süre konuştuk, neyse ki perşembe ve cuma günü önceden planlanmış bir tatilim vardı ama yarın yine işe gidiyorum, onunla tekrar karşılaşmanın kaygısı beni hasta ediyor ve evde oturup herkesin bunu bilip bilmediğini merak ediyorum, eğer birine söylerse ne olur

mesele şu ki ona çok ilgi duyuyordum ama o benim patronumdu, bu yüzden ne yapabilirdim, ayrıca bana ilgi duyup duymadığını da asla anlayamadım çünkü biraz mesafeli ve onu ölçmek zor bazen çok iyi anlaşıyorduk ve burası şimdiye kadar çalıştığım en iyi yer, bu yüzden bunun her şeyi tamamen mahvetmesini istemiyorum

"so my son(6) rides the bus in the morning and waits at a stop with 4 other children around the same age. all the children, including my son have special needs and are in the same class with grades varying from 1st to 5th grade. one of the kids, we'll call her sam(10) waits with her father every morning. he has my phone number bc last year we invited sam to his birthday party. since then, he has called/texted me multiple times asking if I could watch sam outside of school hours. usually I make up an excuse of some sort. I am not comfortable with this for a few reasons. the first being that I barely know them, the only interactions I've had is at this bus stop. the second being that my son is special needs, and is already a lot to handle in such a small space (I live in a 2 bedroom apartment). the third is that sam is not only much older than my son, but much further on the spectrum than he is (I was told by her father she has the mind of a 4 year old). the fourth is that from what I've seen of sam, she's very impulsive and lacks independence (im worried she may hurt herself under my watch). ff to today, he called me and left a voicemail asking if they could drop sam off at my apartment early tomorrow so I could put her on the bus. I am extremely uncomfortable with the thought of this. I've seen her run out into the street at the bus stop multiple times without warning. I also don't know her very well, I don't know what her triggers are, how to soothe her, what she may do or is capable of doing for herself etc. I feel bad because I want to help, but I'm worried what might happen if I do.

I'm 24f and my husband is 29m we've been married for four years and I'm pregnant with our fourth baby girl. He's seemed off lately and I figured something was up so I went through his phone and just like my last pregnancy I found pictures of a girl from Instagram on his recently deleted photos. It was a video of her in her underwear arching her back. However I searched her up and found nothing my guess is she's an OF girl. This happens every time he gets me pregnant then if I follow my doctors orders and stay on bed rest he threatens to kick me out. If I tell him I'm hurting he claims that I don't know what pain is. Then I find those videos and it just makes me feel so much worse. He deleted his Internet history before we went to bed last night and I guess it was so I wouldnt know where he got the videos. Any advice? I'm so upset but feel I may be overreacting because of hormones 😭,"Ben f ve kocam m, dört yıldır evliyiz ve dördüncü kızımıza hamileyim, son zamanlarda garip görünüyordu ve bir şeyler döndüğünü düşündüm, bu yüzden telefonunu karıştırdım ve tıpkı son hamileliğimde olduğu gibi, yakın zamanda sildiği fotoğraflarda instagram'dan bir kızın fotoğraflarını buldum, iç çamaşırıyla sırtını kamburlaştırdığı bir videosuydu, ancak onu aradım ve hiçbir şey bulamadım, tahminimce bir kız çocuğu bu, beni her hamile bıraktığında oluyor, eğer doktorumun talimatlarına uyup yatak istirahatinde kalırsam, ona acı çektiğimi söylersem beni evden atmakla tehdit ediyor, acının ne olduğunu bilmediğimi iddia ediyor, sonra o videoları buluyorum ve bu beni çok daha kötü hissettiriyor, dün gece yatmadan önce internet geçmişini silmiş ve sanırım videoları nereden bulduğunu bilmemek için silmiş.

"Hi.
Sorry if there are any spelling mistakes, English isn’t my native language.

I’m a 25 year old virgin, and although it’s not something I’m ashamed of, I do feel really ready to have sex. Where I live, it’s normal to lose your virginity quite early, so I don’t think I know anyone else who hasn’t had sex yet.

The problem is that I’ve never had a boyfriend or any form of intimate relationship, partly because I suffer from severe anxiety and have struggled with depression for many years. Because of this, I haven’t had the opportunity to get close to people. I’ve considered going out to find a random guy just to get it over with multiple times, but I think I’d be far too anxious in such a situation. 

Recently, I talked to one of my friends, who also suffers from anxiety, about all of this. He offered to have sex with me so that I could just get it out of the way and stop “fearing” that part of a relationship, the next time I meet someone I could see myself being in a relationship with. Without the anxiety about intimacy I think it would make it easier for me to go beyond just friendly relationships.
On one hand, I really want to say yes to his offer because I trust him, and I know he understands me and my situation. But on the other hand, I also fear what might happen to our friendship afterward, I don’t want to lose him as a friend.

So, would it be a bad idea to say yes to his offer, so I can get it over with and possibly be less anxious about intimacy in the future?","merhaba

Hey, I need some advice. I don’t if this is TMI  but YOLO. I’ve been struggling a lot in the bedroom in terms of my confidence with my girlfriend. I don’t know if this is too much information, but here goes: my penis is average-sized, about 5 inches, and I guess it’s on the “thicker” side, as many people say. The issue is my confidence. Ever since my girl dropped the hint that her previous partners were packing white anacondas, I never felt the same. I try to hide it but can’t. I don’t know how to feel. She tells me I’m doing great and it’s the perfect size; it isn’t small. But the thought of her telling me she had much bigger partners before, and mentioning “two hands or more” in the past, literally broke me for weeks. I’m also black and not fitting into the stereotype of having a “BBC,” while her previous white boyfriends had “BWCs.” It eats away at me all the time. I honestly don’t know what to do. She’s told me I’m the perfect size, but I feel like it’s one of those “let me say it’s perfect but in reality it’s small” I have done good to hide my insecurities and pleasure her in other ways since I try to focus on her cumming first, but it’s only causing so much mental anguish I cannot bear it much longer.is there anything I should do to alleviate this :(

Edit: TLDR: 22M feeling insecure about penis size due to being black and having a small penis and GF F24 hinting she had bigger in the past.

Bana harika olduğumu ve mükemmel boyutta olduğunu söylüyor. Küçük değil ama daha önce çok daha büyük partnerleri olduğunu söylemesi ve geçmişte iki veya daha fazla elden bahsetmesi beni haftalarca yıktı. Ayrıca siyahiyim ve bir bbc'ye sahip olma stereotipine uymuyorum. Önceki beyaz erkek arkadaşlarının bbc'leri vardı. Bu beni sürekli kemiriyor. Dürüst olmak gerekirse ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum. Bana mükemmel boyutta olduğumu söyledi ama bunlardan biri gibi hissediyorum. Mükemmel olduğunu söyleyeyim ama aslında küçük. Güvensizliklerimi saklamak ve ona başka şekillerde zevk vermek için iyi bir iş çıkardım. Çünkü ona odaklanmaya çalışıyorum. önce boşalıyorum ama bu sadece çok fazla zihinsel acıya neden oluyor, daha fazla dayanamıyorum, bunu hafifletmek için yapmam gereken bir şey var mı?

"Now me (19m) and my gf (19f) have had our fair share of drunk experiences and most are bad for me because when she drinks she is completely different and is a horny drunk, one time we just had a huge argument about her drinking without telling me (becahse we have a 2 month old baby and it lives with her) and out of nowhere she just says ""so are we gonna fuck kater or what?"" And I was taken aback and she said ""would u rather I fuck someone else or you?""

She also gets verbally abusive and VERY comfortable around people, shes going out with her friend ""K""(20f) and K threw a party over a year ago where she drunk kissed 3 people because she ""thought it was ok because your sister was doing it"" (shes friends w my sister that's how we met) and after this i exploded on her saying that's cheating and broke it off for like a week but got back because it was only a peck.

Another incident was where she drunk kissed my sister infront of me and when we went upstairs I was LIVID with her and she swore up and down shed never do it again.

She told me if she ever slept with anybody drunkenly or mistakenly shed tell me out of guilt (I dont believe this for a second because she admitted to her friend she had a crush on her old coworker) and I was free to do what I wanted after.

She is going out drinking tonight with K (the same girl who threw that party) and everytime she drinks or goes out to drink I can not shake this feeling shes gonna drunk kiss someone again and shes either gonna lie to me about it or I'll find out another way.

I know this level of trust is concerning but she has given me zero reason to trust her because of her past actions, is there a way to move past the mistrust and worry?

TL;DR, my gf has drunk kissed people before while in a relationship with me and after swearing shed never do it again I just cant trust her, how do I build back up the trust? Or will it never come back?","şimdi ben ve kız arkadaşımın sarhoşluk deneyimleri oldu ve çoğu benim için kötü çünkü içtiğinde tamamen farklı oluyor ve azgın bir sarhoş oluyor bir keresinde bana söylemeden içki içmesi hakkında büyük bir tartışma yaşadık çünkü bir aylık bir bebeğimiz var ve onunla yaşıyor ve birdenbire ""Kateter'la mı sevişeceğiz yoksa ne?"" diye sordu ve ben şaşırdım ve ""Başka biriyle mi sevişmemi istersin yoksa seninle mi?"" dedi

ayrıca sözlü tacizde bulunuyor ve insanların yanında çok rahat davranıyor, arkadaşı KF ve K ile dışarı çıkıyor, bir yıl önce bir parti düzenledi ve sarhoş bir şekilde insanları öptü çünkü kız kardeşinin bunu yapması sorun olmadığını düşünüyordu, kız kardeşimle arkadaştı, tanışmamız böyle oldu ve bundan sonra ona bunun aldatma olduğunu söyleyerek patladım ve bir hafta kadar ayrıldık ama sadece bir öpücük olduğu için geri döndüm

başka bir olay da kız kardeşimi önümde sarhoş bir şekilde öpmesiydi ve yukarı çıktığımızda ona çok öfkelendim ve bir daha asla yapmayacağına yemin etti

bana eğer sarhoşken veya yanlışlıkla biriyle yattı mı bana suçluluk duygusuyla söyledi buna bir saniye bile inanmıyorum çünkü arkadaşına eski iş arkadaşına aşık olduğunu itiraf etti ve ben de istediğimi yapmakta özgürdüm

bu gece partiyi düzenleyen aynı kızla içmeye çıkıyor ve her içtiğinde veya içmeye çıktığında bu hissin üstesinden gelemiyorum, yine sarhoş olup birini öpecek ve ya bana yalan söyleyecek ya da başka bir yol bulacağım

"This weighting down on me for many months now, and I’m too ashamed and embarrassed to talk to anyone about it. I assaulted my bf (now ex) last year, and I can’t forgive myself and don’t know what to do. 

We were getting home from a little road trip and we wanted to have sex before hitting the road but didn’t have time for it. We talked about doing it when we’ll get to my place. When we got there, he started saying that it’s late now and he’ll go home, but I didn’t listen to him and started rubbing his pants. He told me no and was trying to remove my hand but I kept going. In a minute I stopped, apologized I he went home. At that moment I didn’t realize the extent of what I did yet. I came from a country with very strong toxic masculinity, where men “never” get raped, it just doesn’t exist as a concept, so it didn’t even cross my mind what I was doing while doing it.. I thought I was playfully seducing him, though he did want sex but only the timing was on the way, so I can touch him and he won’t be able to resist.. My other ex (from my country) was into it and always would get so turned on when I start touching him while he’s busy and tells me no. It was like a game. In my head the logic was “if you don’t want sex we’re not having sex. If you want sex but the timing/place is not right, I’m making it irresistible to say no”. And that’s exactly what I thought at the moment, that he wants sex (bc we discussed it), but the timing is wrong, so I pushed for it. (I don’t think that anymore)

When he got home he texted me how what I did was awful and how it made him feel. I panicked so bad. Went right to him, apologized, he cried, I felt (and still do) as a complete piece of shit. He forgave me, we dated for a few more months and broke up for unrelated reason, but I still can’t forgive myself. I’m thinking that maybe I did ruin everything and that was a hidden reason of breaking up. I can’t forgive myself for violating him like that and I don’t know what to do. I can’t forget seeing him crying, can’t forgive hurting a person I loved this much. We’ve broke up but I want to reach out and apologize for it over and over again bc I feel like it’s never enough. I’ve never been in situation like that before and I definitely never going to do anything like that again, but it weighting down on me every single day. What do I do? 

Edit: I’m not actually going to write him that, I know it would be unfair to him. I just feel like I want to keep apologizing over and over again because it feels like never enough. And that’s true - nothing can undo it, therefore nothing can fix it.

"How to get out of a hot springs trip, because I'm on my period.

It's that time of the month, and I got invited to an end of season get together for my work. I work for a theater and our summer shows are about to wrap, meaning all the actors and crew are going back home across the country. 

Everyone who works for the company and the venue got invited to go to the local hot springs, and the boss is paying for everyone. I can't go, but I don't want to tell my boss why. It's a very small group (like 15 people). People would definitely notice my absence, and my boss did directly reach out to me about it.

"My friend (13F) recently opened up about her relationship with her childhood friend’s father (38M), Pedro (not his real name) in a group chat. Everyone in the group chat was against the relationship yet my friend says we are being too “paranoid.”

It started off of her asking if she’s a bad person because she is talking to Pedro and he has a wife and 3 kids. We responded how she is a victim and is being taken advantage of. We had an entire argument over it and were extremely concerned by this situation. 

During the argument, my friend would say how she’s “mature” and can “consent”. She also mentioned how since she is German, it is apparently normal for girls her age to date and fall in love. We live in America. She thinks she won’t be raped, killed, or anything by Pedro because he is nice.

About her relationship, Pedro knew my friend ever since she was a baby. In their free time, they would cuddle and kiss every time they met in person. Also, Pedro had been sending inappropriate pictures to her and said he wants to marry her once she’s old enough. He manipulated my friend into staying in the relationship by telling her he would kill himself if she leaves. 

Please help me, I am very concerned by my friend’s relationship and i don’t want anything to happen to her.

"I’m at a crossroads in my life, just one month into my marriage, and I’m seriously considering filing for divorce.

To give you some context, my husband and I had a beautiful wedding filled with love and laughter. We had been dating for three years, and throughout our relationship, he always seemed supportive and trustworthy. I felt like we were building a strong life together.

However, last week, everything changed when he came home looking distraught. After some prodding, he finally admitted that he has been struggling with a serious gambling addiction for most of his adult life. He revealed that he had hidden it from me and even continued to gamble after we got married, racking up thousands of dollars in debt.

I was blindsided. I knew he liked to play poker occasionally, but I never realized it had spiraled into something so severe. His explanation painted a devastating picture of secret loans, lies, and missed payments. He expressed deep remorse and insisted he wanted to change, even suggesting he attend support groups.

While I understand that addiction is a complex issue and can happen to anyone, I’m finding it incredibly hard to cope. I feel betrayed, confused, and angry. How could someone I trusted keep such a massive part of their life hidden from me? It makes me question everything about our relationship.

I've spent countless hours thinking about whether we can work through this together or if it’s healthier for me to walk away. I'm scared of the future, not just for us but for my financial safety and emotional well-being. I’ve done some research on support options for partners of addicts and am considering talking to a therapist myself.

I guess I’m reaching out to ask if anyone has been in a similar situation. How did you navigate it? Can a marriage survive something like this, or is it better for me to cut my losses and start anew? I feel so lost and overwhelmed right now.","Hayatımın bir dönüm noktasındayım, evliliğimin üzerinden henüz bir ay geçti ve boşanma davası açmayı ciddi ciddi düşünüyorum

"Alright so this is kind of a weird situation and I know the logical answer is to cut him off but it’s really hard for me to do that. He’s my only friend and I’m an awkward guy. Outside of him and my girl and family I have no other friends. 

So this all started a little over two months ago. Me and him were chilling and I was showing him stuff on my phone. We were going through my camera roll cause I wanted ti show him something. It was in my hidden folder ans I opened it without thinking and a bunch of pictures that me and my girlfriend took together when we were bored popped up instead. They were months old and I forgot they were there otherwise I wouldn’t have opened the folder. Either way, he saw it for a split second and I quickly moved the phone away, laughing and saying sorry about that. 

He asked what was that and I just said my girl likes to take nsfw pics with me cuz she finds them hot. In some of the pics she was nude with like my hand or mouth on her or something. Nothing too explicit but they were definitely for my eyes only. 

He asked to see and I said no. He was like aw come on don’t be like that. I laughed and told him to drop it. He did at that moment until he saw my girlfriend in person again and wrapped an arm around her, when he said hello. Obviously she was confused ans pushed him off, asking what his problem was. He laughed and said nothing but he was blatantly staring at her chest. She shrugged it off but it just pissed me off. 

I told him to knock it off and he said he wasn’t doing anything. Since then he always asks ti see something on my phone and normally I just hand it to him cuz I have nothing to hide on my phone but I found myself not being able to trust him and asked him what for

He said he wants to look at the screenshots of the PowerPoints i took in class. I told him I’d just air drop it to them and he says he doesn’t want them in his camera roll and it’ll be quick. I handed it to him and let him look at it for a few moments as I went back to playing my game and noticed he was typing a lot on my phone when he just wanted to look at pictures. I stood up pretending to grab something from my bedside table and saw him swipe out of the hidden folder after failing to guess my passcode to unlock it, then scroll through my camera roll for the photos. A few seconds later he said aw man can’t find them, and handed it back to me. 

It’s so obvious he was trying to unlock my folder to look at the photos and it just pissed me off. I wanna confront him but I don’t know what to say. I also suck at confrontation also, it’s scary and like I said before he’s my only friend and I don’t wanna piss him off and make him leave. 

My girlfriend doesn’t know he saw a glimpse of the photos but I reckon she doesn’t care because she told me once she showed her friends the videos because she thought it was hot and wanted to show off lmao. Idk what’s he showed them but it doesn’t bother me. My friend trying so hard to look does bother me though. ","tamam bu biraz garip bir durum ve mantıklı cevabın onu hayatımdan çıkarmak olduğunu biliyorum ama bunu yapmak benim için gerçekten zor o benim tek arkadaşım ve ben onun, kız arkadaşımın ve ailemin dışında garip bir adamım başka arkadaşım yok

ne olduğunu sordu ve ben sadece kız arkadaşımın benimle nsfw fotoğraflar çekmeyi sevdiğini söyledim çünkü bazı fotoğraflarda onları ateşli buluyordu çıplaktı sanki elim veya ağzım üzerindeydi ya da başka bir şey çok açıklayıcı değildi ama kesinlikle sadece benim görmem içindi

görmek istedi ve ben de dedim hayır, ""hadi ama böyle olma"" dedi, güldüm ve ona bırakmasını söyledim, o anda bıraktı, ta ki kız arkadaşımı tekrar şahsen görene kadar ve merhaba dediğinde kolunu ona dolayana kadar. belli ki kafası karışmıştı ve onu iterek ne sorunu olduğunu sordu, güldü ve hiçbir şey söylemedi ama açıkça göğsüne bakıyordu, omuz silkti ama bu beni sinirlendirdi

ona bırakmasını söyledim ve o zamandan beri hiçbir şey yapmayacağını söyledi, her zaman telefonumda bir şey görmemi istiyor ve normalde telefonumda saklayacak hiçbir şeyim olmadığı için ona veriyorum ama ona güvenemediğimi fark ettim ve ne için olduğunu sordum

sınıfta aldığım powerpoint'lerin ekran görüntülerine bakmak istediğini söyledi, ona sadece onlara Airdrop yapacağımı söyledim ve kamera rulosunda istemediğini ve hızlı olacağını söyledi, ona verdim ve birkaç dakika bakmasına izin verdim, oyunuma geri döndüm ve sadece resimlere bakmak istediğinde telefonumda çok fazla yazı yazdığını fark ettim, ayağa kalktım ve numara yaptım başucu masamdan bir şey almak için ve şifremi tahmin edemedikten sonra gizli klasörden çıkarken gördüm, sonra birkaç saniye sonra fotoğraflar için kamera rulomda gezindim, ah dostum onları bulamıyorum dedi ve bana geri verdi

fotoğraflara bakmak için klasörümün kilidini açmaya çalıştığı çok açıktı ve bu beni sinirlendirdi, onunla yüzleşmek istiyorum ama ne diyeceğimi bilmiyorum, ayrıca yüzleşmede berbatım, ayrıca korkutucu ve daha önce de söylediğim gibi o benim tek arkadaşım ve onu sinirlendirmek ve gitmesini sağlamak istemiyorum

kız arkadaşım fotoğrafların bir kısmını gördüğünü bilmiyor ama sanırım umursamıyor çünkü bir keresinde bana arkadaşlarına videoları gösterdiğini çünkü bunun ateşli olduğunu düşündüğünü ve hava atmak istediğini söyledi lmao ne gösterdiğini bilmiyorum ama beni rahatsız etmiyor, arkadaşım bakmaya çok çalışıyor ama beni rahatsız ediyor"

"I’m 17 and am a closeted bisexual with a preference for women. My family is extremely homophobic and I can’t risk them knowing. Well I was at a party a few days ago and somehow some guys I know and hated from school found out and they were at the party. They approached me and said that they’d tell everyone unless I had sex with them. I would be in serious danger if my parents found out and I panicked and went with them to a bedroom.

I wanted to save myself for marriage but I couldn’t and I feel really gross. I can’t even report it because then they’ll tell people making what I went through all for nothing. Idk what to do I need help, how can I feel normal after this and hopefully make them see consequence for this?","ben ve gizli bir biseksüelim, kadınlara karşı bir tercihim var, ailem aşırı homofobik ve bunu bilerek riske edemem, birkaç gün önce bir partideydim ve bir şekilde okuldan tanıdığım ve nefret ettiğim bazı adamlar öğrendi ve partideydiler, bana yaklaştılar ve eğer onlarla seks yapmazsam herkese söyleyeceklerini söylediler, eğer ailem öğrenirse ciddi tehlikede olacağımı söylediler ve panikledim ve onlarla bir yatak odasına gittim

kendimi evlilik için saklamak istedim ama yapamadım ve kendimi gerçekten iğrenç hissediyorum, bunu bile bildiremiyorum çünkü o zaman insanlara söylerler, yaşadıklarımı boşuna yapmış olurlar ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, yardıma ihtiyacım var, bundan sonra nasıl normal hissedebilirim ve umarım bunun sonuçlarını görmelerini sağlayabilirim"
"I had an abortion 2 years ago because, at that time, I wasn't ready financially, mentally, and emotionally. A part of me always felt awful about this, but I was never really sad that I did what I did. I think that I'm a very logical and practical person, and 2 years ago, I felt like it was irresponsible to keep the baby (and still feel the same way now.) So I never felt guilty or regretted what I did, and even months after, I never changed my mind. Instead of sadness, regret, or anything like that, I started to worry about something else. I started to worry about how I would feel if and when I got pregnant again and decide to keep it. 

  
Well now I'm a few weeks pregnant and me and my partner (same partner 2 years ago) both agree that we're both finally in a good place and that we're ready to start a family. But I was only happy for a while when I found out. I was happy because this is something I've actually wanted for a long time, happy that I'm the right situation to have this baby, and happy I'm finally building this life with my partner, but then I started to feel guilty. Not guilty for what I did 2 years ago but guilty for what I'm doing now. I feel like I have no right to be happy about this baby. I mean, what makes this baby more deserving to live than the one I aborted? And again, I don't regret the abortion I had, it's more of that I don't feel like I have the right to be happy or to celebrate this one.

To continue my spiral, I'm additionally worried that even when this baby is out, I'm still going to think like this. Think about how my child is alive knowing that I gave one up before him/her. Or I'd ask myself why I'm so happy with this child when I so easily aborted one and then force myself to just be unhappy, because again, I have no right to be happy about this child when I wasn't about the first one. 

Now I honestly don't know what to do or what to think. I don't know what to do with these thoughts and feelings, and honestly, I'm worried that I'm going to feel this way forever. Any advice?   


UPDATE:

Hello! I was replying to most comments last night but got overwhelmed by all the replies I saw when I woke up this morning. I want to say thank you to everyone for their messages, their kind words, advice, tough love, and hard truths. To also clarify something that many people brought up (that I realized I forgot to mention) is that I am in therapy! I've been going for years now for unrelated things and for this also. I think when it just get really bad, I like also try to go to different places to find different perspectives and advices on it. But don't worry, I am also and have been talking to a professional. It has been mostly helpful, but as I mentioned, my new pregnancy now has caused me to spiral back to step 1--which of course is something me and my therapist have been working on.

Again, I would like to wholeheartedly thank everyone. I didn't know what to expect when I posted this, but I woke up today to many messages that I know I will go back to and read in the future. Many of you have reminded me what is important and what I should focus on doing, and a few of you have also given me a new perspective on so many things--which I know I will carry with me to grow and be better for myself and my family. 

I wish also for all of you to have a good day and I share my love to all of you as well!","Yıllar önce kürtaj oldum çünkü o zamanlar maddi, zihinsel ve duygusal olarak hazır değildim, bir parçam bunun için her zaman kötü hissetti ama yaptığım şeyden dolayı asla gerçekten üzgün olmadım, çok mantıklı ve pratik bir insan olduğumu düşünüyorum ve yıllar önce bebeği tutmanın sorumsuzluk olduğunu hissettim ve şimdi hala aynı şekilde hissediyorum, bu yüzden asla suçlu hissetmedim veya yaptığım şeyden pişman olmadım ve aylar sonra bile fikrimi değiştirmedim, üzüntü, pişmanlık veya buna benzer bir şey yerine başka bir şey için endişelenmeye başladım, tekrar hamile kalırsam ve onu tutmaya karar verirsem nasıl hissedeceğim konusunda endişelenmeye başladım

Şimdi birkaç haftalık hamileyim ve ben ve partnerim yıllar önce aynı partnerdik, ikimiz de sonunda iyi bir yerde olduğumuzu ve bir aile kurmaya hazır olduğumuzu kabul ettik ama sadece mutlu olduğumu öğrendiğimde bir süre mutlu oldum çünkü bu aslında uzun zamandır istediğim bir şeydi bu bebeği doğurmak için doğru durumda olduğum için mutluyum ve sonunda partnerimle bu hayatı inşa ettiğim için mutluyum ama sonra suçlu hissetmeye başladım yıllar önce yaptığım şeyden değil şimdi yaptığım şeyden suçlu hissediyorum bu bebek için mutlu olmaya hakkım yok yani bu bebeği kürtaj yaptırdığım bebekten daha fazla yaşamayı hak eden ne ve tekrar kürtaj yaptırdığım için pişman değilim daha çok mutlu olma veya bunu kutlama hakkım olmadığını hissetmemden kaynaklanıyor

sarmal döngümü sürdürmek için ayrıca bu bebek doğduğunda bile böyle düşüneceğimden endişeleniyorum çocuğumun nasıl hayatta olduğunu düşünün ondan önce birinden vazgeçtim ya da kendime bu çocukla neden bu kadar mutlu olduğumu sorardım birini kolayca kürtaj yaptırdığımda ve sonra kendimi sadece mutsuz olmaya zorladığımda çünkü tekrar bu çocukla mutlu olmaya hakkım yok ilk çocukla ilgili olmadığımda

şimdi dürüst olmak gerekirse ne yapacağımı veya ne düşüneceğimi bilmiyorum bu düşüncelerle ve duygularla ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum ve dürüst olmak gerekirse sonsuza dek bu şekilde hissedeceğimden endişeleniyorum herhangi bir tavsiyeniz var mı

tekrar herkese içtenlikle teşekkür etmek istiyorum, bunu yayınladığımda ne bekleyeceğimi bilmiyordum ama bugün uyandığımda gelecekte geri dönüp okuyacağımı bildiğim birçok mesajla karşılaştım, birçoğunuz bana neyin önemli olduğunu ve neye odaklanmam gerektiğini hatırlattınız ve birkaçınız da bana birçok şey hakkında yeni bir bakış açısı kazandırdınız, bunu kendim ve ailem için büyümek ve daha iyi olmak için yanımda taşıyacağımı biliyorum

"TRIGGER WARNING 
So last night me (24f) my brother (26m) and my sister (19f) were out drinking. We all had quite a bit to drink and were out at a club. Lock out came at 2am where everyone went out the front of the club. Me, my brother and a few other guys were standing in a doorway and I was standing next to my brother. The other guys were standing across from us so he was the only one near me. There were no women near us and my brother is straight. I felt my brothers hand on my back between my shoulders and then I felt him start to run his hand down my back and onto my a**.. at first I was shocked and just stood there but then walked away and pulled my sister to the side to tell her what happened. She basically said he wouldn’t have meant it and it was an accident. 
My brother walked off after this and we didn’t see him again until today. He hasn’t said anything about it, we live in the same house and I don’t know how to handle this situation but i feel really uncomfortable now. What do I do? 

EDIT: yes my brother had had quite abit to drink but he’s also a heavy drinker.. if there’s anything he does well it’s hold his liquor. I’ve seen him drink full bottles of vodka and not even slur his speech, so I don’t think it’s a matter of “he drank too much” ","tetik uyarısı
dün gece ben, kardeşim, m ve kız kardeşim f dışarıda içiyorduk hepimiz epey içmiştik ve bir kulüpteydik, sabahın köründe herkes kulübün önünden dışarı çıktı, kardeşim, birkaç adam daha bir kapının önünde duruyorduk ve ben kardeşimin yanında duruyordum, diğer adamlar karşımızda duruyordu, bu yüzden yakınımda tek o vardı, yakınımızda kadın yoktu ve kardeşim dik duruyordu, kardeşimin elini omuzlarımın arasında sırtımda hissettim ve sonra elini sırtımdan aşağı ve a'ma doğru gezdirmeye başladığını hissettim, ilk başta şok oldum ve öylece durdum ama sonra uzaklaştım ve kız kardeşimi kenara çekip ona ne olduğunu anlattım, temelde bunu kastetmediğini ve bunun bir kaza olduğunu söyledi
kardeşim bundan sonra gitti ve onu bugün bir daha görmedik, bu konuda hiçbir şey söylemedi, aynı evde yaşıyoruz ve bu durumla nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum ama şimdi kendimi gerçekten rahatsız hissediyorum, ne yapmalıyım

düzenle evet, kardeşim çok içmişti ama aynı zamanda çok içiyordu, iyi yaptığı bir şey varsa o da tutun içkisini içtiğini gördüm şişeler dolusu votka içti ve konuşmasında bile aksaklık olmadı bu yüzden çok fazla içtiği için sorun olduğunu düşünmüyorum"
"I overheard my wife on the phone say she settled for me.

We have been married for 4 years. I never got the impression that she wasn't into me. Before we married, she might had bouts of not responding to my text or saying much for days at a time, then she would come back to surface and be happy to see me again. She always said it's because she was busy taking care of work or school, and she is glad to have those off her back and see me again. Sometimes she had this thousand yard stare for a couple seconds or when I wasn't looking, now that I think about it.

She likes to go to a different room when she is on the phone, and I never thought much of it. However I was passing by in the hallway and overheard her talking pretty fast with an intense tone in her voice. Apparently she would have preferred to be with a woman, but she was happy ""settling"" for me and that she has a good life with me now, I am a good man she gets along with, and she has no plan of leaving me.

So nothing will change in our marriage. She isn't leaving me or anything. She isn't thinking about other men. She seems to put effort in and I never thought she settled for me. She takes care of me pretty well. Does little things like bring me coffee in the morning and make sure I leave with everything I need, affection, initiates sex, seems to like talking to me. Inside jokes. I would have never guessed. Maybe she's just playing a role. But does it really matter what she's thinking deep inside? Are you what you pretend to be? Am I a little bitch for constantly thinking about how she ""settled"" for me?","karımın telefonda benimle anlaştığını söylediğini duydum

yıllardır evliyiz, evlenmeden önce benden hoşlanmadığı izlenimini hiç edinmedim, bazen mesajlarıma cevap vermeme veya günlerce pek bir şey söylememe nöbetleri geçiriyordu, sonra yüzeye çıkıyor ve beni tekrar gördüğüne mutlu oluyordu, her zaman bunun iş veya okulla meşgul olduğu için olduğunu ve bunları geride bırakıp beni tekrar gördüğü için mutlu olduğunu söylüyordu, bazen birkaç saniye veya ben bakmadığımda bin metrelik bakışlar atıyordu, şimdi düşünüyorum da

telefonda konuşurken farklı bir odaya gitmeyi seviyor ve ben bunu pek fazla önemsemedim, ancak koridorda geçerken oldukça hızlı konuştuğunu ve sesinde yoğun bir ton olduğunu duydum, görünüşe göre bir kadınla olmayı tercih ederdi, ancak benimle anlaşarak mutluydu ve benimle iyi bir hayat yaşadığını, şimdi iyi bir adamım, iyi geçiniyor ve beni terk etmeyi düşünmüyor

bu yüzden evliliğimizde hiçbir şey değişmeyecek, beni terk etmiyor veya başka bir şey, başka erkekleri düşünmüyor, öyle görünüyor çaba sarf ettim ve onun benimle yetindiğini hiç düşünmedim, benimle oldukça iyi ilgileniyor, sabahları bana kahve getirmek ve ihtiyacım olan her şeyle ayrılmamı sağlamak gibi küçük şeyler yapıyor, sevgi başlatıyor, benimle asla tahmin edemeyeceğim şakalar yapmayı seviyor, belki de sadece bir rol yapıyor ama içten içe ne düşündüğünün gerçekten önemi var mı, sen göründüğün gibi biri misin? sürekli olarak onun benimle nasıl yetindiğini düşündüğüm için küçük bir kaltak mıyım?"
"I asked her where her parents are and she said dad is at home while mom is with her grandparents. He apparently lets her come to the park alone quite often. This park is public and right next to a street on two sides of the park. It's not safe, as she could easily be kidnapped and she's clearly trusting enough to tell me her name, age, and why she is alone.

I asked where her house is and she pointed down the street. I kept watch and saw a man come around the corner to glance at the park after 10 minutes. He seemed to look at her, then me (25F), then disappear around the corner again. I asked the girl if that was her house and she said yes. It's 200 feet away around a corner and not directly visible to the playground where the 2 year old was. I confirmed it was her house later when she rode her scooter over there. 

I was able to have full conversations with the girl. I learned that she's almost 3, but i still don't think it's safe for her to be out at the park without direct supervision at that age. She's pretty well-spoken and told me she goes to preschool on weekdays. I'm worried I was able to talk to her so much considering stranger danger, especially getting her name and parents names so easily. 

I don't think I should call 911 or CPS since her dad is just around the corner. And I have a 3 year old daughter myself so i know how difficult it is at that age for them to understand stranger danger. I feel like I should say something, but I'm not sure what to say. I've seen a lot of people going in and out of this park and I'm not even from here so it's not like I'd be recognized. 

I don't think this situation is safe. What should I do?","anne ve babasının nerede olduğunu sordum ve bana babasının evde olduğunu, annesinin dedesi ve büyükbabasıyla birlikte olduğunu söyledi, görünüşe göre sık sık tek başına parka gelmesine izin veriyormuş bu park halka açık ve parkın iki tarafında bir sokağın hemen yanında güvenli değil çünkü kolayca kaçırılabilir ve bana adını, yaşını ve neden yalnız olduğunu söyleyecek kadar güveniyor

evinin nerede olduğunu sordum ve sokağın aşağısını işaret etti, nöbet tuttum ve köşeden parka bakmak için gelen bir adam gördüm, birkaç dakika sonra ona baktı, sonra bana baktı ve tekrar köşeden kayboldu, kıza bunun onun evi olup olmadığını sordum ve evet dedi, bir köşeden birkaç adım ötede ve yaşındaki çocuğun olduğu oyun alanına doğrudan görünmüyordu, daha sonra scooter'ıyla oraya gittiğinde bunun onun evi olduğunu doğruladım

kızla tam sohbet edebildim, neredeyse olduğunu öğrendim ama yine de o yaşta doğrudan gözetim olmadan parkta olmasının güvenli olduğunu düşünmüyorum, oldukça iyi konuşuyor ve bana hafta içi anaokuluna gittiğini söyledi, yabancı tehlikesini göz önünde bulundurarak onunla çok konuşabildiğim için endişeliyim özellikle ismini ve ebeveynlerinin isimlerini çok kolay öğreniyorum

babası hemen köşede olduğu ve benim de bir yaşında kızım olduğu için çocuk koruma servisini aramam gerektiğini düşünmüyorum bu yaşta yabancı tehlikesini anlamalarının ne kadar zor olduğunu biliyorum bir şeyler söylemem gerektiğini hissediyorum ama ne söyleyeceğimden emin değilim bu parka girip çıkan çok insan gördüm ve ben buradan bile değilim bu yüzden tanınmam

"F23 here. My roommates boyfriend (M25) and her (F21) will play shooter games in the living room, and he gets very angry and aggressive. He never says the N-word, but pretty much anything else is on the table, especially and most often slurs used against gay people. My roommate doesnt acknowledge it and it makes me so uncomfortable. I have no idea how he thinks it's an acceptable way to act, but idk if he would even listen to me. Any advice?

Valentine’s Day is less than 2 weeks away, and I really don’t want to spend money unnecessarily just because she’s being emotional about it. Like I said, she has never brought it up until last night, which clearly wasn’t a good time to be sobbing about it so loudly that she woke me up and tried making me feel guilty about it. It seems like a bigger issue than flowers, but she’s making it about the flowers.

"I'm 23F. I know people say it's young, but it doesn't feel that way AT ALL. Plus, youth by definition end at 25 so I'm basically at the dawn of what would considered youth and carefree. I should have things figured out by now.

I've literally done everything wrong until now, missed all the milestones and feel like a 16 yo trapped inside an adult body.

So, here are all the f★ck ups I've done so far:

1. WASTED ages 16-23 self bariccated in my bedroom, maybe due to undiagnosed depression. Spent every single day on the internet, sleeping and eating like shit.
2. Social anxiety. I'm freaking 23 yo and I fear people  and talking to the telephone!!!
3. Failed my college entrance examinations 3 times because I wasn't studying, somehow got admitted, changed multiple courses,  settled with one. Dropped out and went back. Making me now a ""freshman"" at 23, among 17-18 yos.
4. I don't feel passionate about my major, it's very practical and in high demand though.
5. Used to be a straight A student, now haven't opened a book in 8 years. I don't even know if I have the mental capabilities anymore.
6. I might have perfectionism OCD.
7. Have only worked fast food jobs.
8. Am still relying financially on my parents, which makes me feel like shit.
9. No social life. 
10. No boyfriend/sex ever.
11. Literally 0 friends.
12. I feel SO SO behind compared to my peers and that I'll lose my chance at life and die a lonely 60 yo virgin that has never been loved nor done anything with her life.
13. I have literally no clue or direction. I have no idea how I'm supposed to live my life and what choices to make.
14. I feel anxious and guilty about the lost time and the lost opportunities of youth.
15. I feel like I'll never recover from the years of harm I've done to myself and that makes me desperate.
16.  Burned through my summer savings.
17. No driving licence yet.","im f biliyorum insanlar genç olduğunu söylüyor ama hiç de öyle hissettirmiyor artı gençlik tanımı gereği bitiyor bu yüzden temelde gençlik ve kaygısız olarak kabul edilebilecek şeyin şafağındayım artık her şeyi çözmüş olmalıyım

"10 days ago I found out my husband had a month long affair. I was completely devastated. This man has always treated our kids and I so well. I thought our communication and relationship was the best you could ever ask for. Yes we had the normal spats here and there but nothing this major. I never knew he was unhappy and our bed room life was great! For a married couple with two kids, 3 to 4 times a week was our normal.
 
When I found out I told him I wanted a divorce. He told me “no” he “will not agree to a divorce”. I told him to leave and to give me a week. He was gone for two days and texted me saying he is coming home that he “can’t handle being away from my wife and girls”. I wish he would have thought about that before.. I told him he has to agree with couples counseling and he did. We had our first session three days ago and I was so upset, angry and baffled with what he had to say and for his reason for stepping out of our marriage. He told me and the counselor he is tired of the laundry. LAUNDRY! He doesn’t want to look in our hamper for clothes so he just got fed up with it. 

Okay I understand I could do better with putting away our clean clothes after I wash them, but going out of our marriage instead of coming to me and tell me you’re done with it or even help me!? I’m having troubles understanding that.

The love I had for him is different now.. I don’t respect him no more. I don’t look at him as my best friend and lover anymore but just a person I once had true love and adore every inch of has vanished. 10 days ago I was a woman in a loving marriage and had a great relationship and now it’s all gone. 

I don’t know if everything I’m feeling is normal. Don’t know if I can fall in love with him again. Maybe it would be best to file for divorce and move on. I’m conflicted.","günler önce kocamın bir aylık bir ilişkisi olduğunu öğrendim tamamen yıkılmıştım bu adam çocuklarımıza ve bana her zaman çok iyi davrandı iletişimimizin ve ilişkimizin isteyebileceğiniz en iyi şey olduğunu düşündüm evet arada sırada normal kavgalarımız oldu ama bu kadar büyük bir şey değildi mutsuz olduğunu hiç bilmiyordum ve yatak odası hayatımız iki çocuklu evli bir çift için harikaydı haftada iki kez normaldi

öğrendiğimde boşanmak istediğimi söyledim bana boşanmayı kabul etmeyeceğini söyledi gitmesini ve bana bir hafta vermesini söyledim iki gün boyunca gitti ve eve döneceğini ve karımdan ve kızlarımdan uzak kalamayacağını söyleyen bir mesaj attı keşke ona çift terapisine gitmesi gerektiğini söylemeden önce bunu düşünseydi ve öyle yaptı üç gün önce ilk seansımızı yaptık ve söyledikleri ve evliliğimizden ayrılma nedeni konusunda çok üzgün, öfkeli ve şaşkındım bana ve danışmana çamaşırlardan bıktığını söyledi çamaşır sepetimizde kıyafet aramak istemiyordu bu yüzden bıkmıştı

tamam anlıyorum, yıkadıktan sonra temiz kıyafetlerimizi kaldırmam daha iyi olurdu ama gelip bana işin bittiğini söylemek veya bana yardım etmek yerine evliliğimizden ayrılmak, bunu anlamakta zorluk çekiyorum

ona olan sevgim artık farklı, artık ona saygı duymuyorum, onu artık en iyi arkadaşım ve sevgilim olarak görmüyorum, sadece bir zamanlar gerçek aşkım olan ve her santimini hayranlıkla izlediğim biri, günler önce yok oldu, sevgi dolu bir evlilikte kadındım ve harika bir ilişkim vardı ve şimdi hepsi gitti

Cut off because I wasn’t able to pay the bill which he knew about, no big deal. After waking up today around three pm (I work nights he works day and we both watch our child.) I took my daughter and my dog for a walk around the neighborhood. Once we got home I sent him a message through Wi-Fi that I was going to get my medication refilled. After leaving I didn’t even think to look at my phone because obviously it was pointless. What should have been a 5 minute trip turned into a 45 minute. I had our daughter with us. When I got home he gritted his teeth at me collected our daughter and demanded I get inside which I did because I’ve done nothing wrong. We went into a guest room we have and he began accusing me of cheating saying my iPhone location showed I was at one of our neighbors houses and it showed I was in his bedroom. I’ve never spoken to this person in my life. He then continued to talk down to me and even had me strip down to nothing so he could “ check.”  After wards when he calmed down I told him to f••• off and he got slightly offended. I went to my shift and I found my self crying I hid in the linen closet and calmed myself before returning to work. I’m normally a very happy and bubble person but right now I feel like my heart won’t calm down and my stomach is in knots.

"I 24F and my husband 27M have been married for 3 years and have a young son (2). We are both muslim and are both from different cultures (I am Tunisian) and he is Pakistani. I haven't been back home in a while and the last time we went I brought him with me. He hated it and resented me for bringing him there and that was before our child. Now I want to go back home, show my son to my family and reconnect with friends and relatives and he will not let me  go alone and will not come with me. He claims its for religious reasons however his own mother travels alone all the time and I was not brought up in a conservative household and travelling as a woman has never been an issue. He refuses to go with me, and says if I go alone I cannot take my son and must leave him with him. Further he says if I go without him I must take either my brother or dad - neither of which can go this year. My mother will be there but he does not care and says without a man I can't go even though he won't come with me and is forcing me to stay. I don't know what to do. I feel trapped and don't know what to do - do I just take my son and go without him (if i do he says he will call the authorities on me for stealing our child) do I sit it out and remain trapped. Please help!!!

"I’m a bisexual 22 M and my gf is 23 F straight. Shes very supportive of my sexuality and was very happy for me when I finally found myself. But whenever pride is mentioned she goes ballistic. Like when we go past pride flags in a shop she goes “Wtf is the point of the flag? Like they arnt a country. Why is their black and brown on it? Black people are not a sexuality it’s a race”. I explained to her why the flag exists and how the black and brown represents queer people of colour. But she kept saying how stupid and pointless it is. I can’t help but feel really uneasy about this. I asked her drunkenly one night if we could go to a pride festival/march and she was like “errr why??” and I just said I would love to go. I remember her saying yes but she didn’t look too thrilled.
I’ve told her that I just don’t want her to mention any negativity against the pride flag but she’s so strongly against it. She said she’s not against LGBTQ+ people, she just doesn’t like the flag and how it’s a rainbow. 
What do I do? I feel like I need to chat with her about this more.

"i took a turn too fast in my car and spun out... i was going around a 75 or so degree turn and just lost grip on the apex. luckily the car was built for these types of situations and didnt roll. i was going around 110kms/h and im amazed that i was able to straighten out. i was mere centimeteres if not fucking millimeters away from losing control completely and in turn losing my life

"[I punched my brother and now I kinda regret it (part1)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/GYZnjKSOTr)

First of all, I want to thank this wonderful community for the advice and support you’ve given me. I’m only 17, and there’s still so much I’m learning about life. It means a lot to have both adults and fellow teenagers here who understand my situation and are willing to offer guidance.

When my father got home after I punched my brother, he was furious. But thanks to the advice from some amazing Redditors, I felt prepared to explain my side of the story.My dad, mom, brother, and I sat down in the living room. My brother was still crying, holding his nose. Thankfully, the injury wasn’t severe, but seeing him like that made me want to punch myself for what I’d done. My father was trying to calm down. This was the first time violence had entered our family. He asked me in an angry tone, ‘What were you thinking, hitting your little brother?!’...This was the first time I had ever punched anyone, and if it weren’t for the support from this community, I’m not sure what I would have said. I explained that I didn’t mean to hurt my brother or make our mom cry. I told them that I would accept any punishment they decided on because I regret hitting my brother. But I also told them that I don’t regret standing up for my mom, and that I would do the same for any of them if someone in our family was disrespected like that.After I finished, there was complete silence. They all looked at me, and I didn’t even realize I was tearing up until I found myself apologizing to my brother. I told him I was sorry because I can’t stand seeing anyone in our family disrespected. And then I broke down...guilt, anger, regret, remorse, relief, and sadness all hit me at once. My mom hugged me, and for the first time, my brother just sat there in silence. I hope he understood that I was truly sorry and that we were both wrong in our own ways.

My father eventually calmed down and told me that I should never resort to violence again, especially towards family. They also spoke to my brother, telling him that he needs to start acting more maturely and took away his PS5 after he broke my mom’s laptop.I’m deeply grateful to everyone who offered advice in my recent post. I realize now that while I regret punching my brother, I don’t feel guilty for protecting my mom from his uncontrollable behavior. 

I’m relieved that things turned out okay, and I really hope my brother and I can move past this and get back to the way we were. I love him so much, and I love my parents too. Thank you again, from the bottom of my heart, to everyone who helped me through this.","kardeşime yumruk attım ve şimdi biraz pişmanım parthttpswwwredditcomradvicesgyznjksotr

babam sonunda sakinleşti ve bana bir daha asla şiddete başvurmamam gerektiğini söyledi, özellikle aileme karşı. ayrıca kardeşimle konuşup ona daha olgun davranması gerektiğini söylediler ve annemin dizüstü bilgisayarını kırdıktan sonra ps'sini aldı. son gönderimde bana tavsiyede bulunan herkese çok minnettarım. şimdi kardeşime yumruk attığım için pişman olsam da suçluluk hissetmediğimi fark ettim. Annemi kontrol edilemez davranışlarından koruduğu için

Her şeyin yoluna girmesinden dolayı rahatladım ve umarım kardeşim ve ben bunu atlatıp eski halimize dönebiliriz onu çok seviyorum ve ailemi de seviyorum bu süreçte bana yardım eden herkese kalbimin derinliklerinden tekrar teşekkür ederim"
"A few months ago, my colleague Dave started frequently discussing our old hobby of competitive rock climbing. I used to be very passionate about it, but after a series of injuries and health issues, I had to give it up for good. I haven't talked about it at work because I found the experience quite stressful and am still dealing with the physical aftermath.

Dave keeps mentioning it in conversations, assuming I’m still active in the sport and enthusiastic about it. I feel uncomfortable and don’t want to relive those difficult times. How can I gently steer the conversation away without going into too much detail or making things awkward? Any suggestions?","birkaç ay önce meslektaşım dave eski hobimiz olan rekabetçi kaya tırmanışını sık sık tartışmaya başladı. eskiden bu konuda çok tutkuluydum ancak bir dizi sakatlık ve sağlık sorunundan sonra tamamen bırakmak zorunda kaldım. iş yerinde bundan bahsetmedim çünkü deneyimi oldukça stresli buldum ve hala fiziksel sonuçlarıyla uğraşıyorum

"My (33) wife (33) and I have been happily married for almost 10 years now. We were both grown up in traditional families, and fell in love with each other early in life. As a result of that, neither of us have had much opportunity to explore sexually. That’s totally fine with me. She’s everything I want. And until recently, I was sure the same could be said of her.

So, for the last year my wife has been floating the idea of a “free pass.” At first, I was it was just a joke, so I’d go along with it and it would lead to us having sex. But then I realized she actually means it. Things got a bit more complicated.

A while ago she met a guy at the gym (we both go to the same gym frequently) and they would kind of exchange pleasantries which is totally fine. Then, she started asking me to not “hang around” her while we’re at the gym. Okay. No problem. You want your space — you got it. Then she started asking me to not come to the gym on certain days!!! Because she wants to go out and have coffee with this “friend”.

At this point, I got upset and asked her what’s going on. She straight up told me she’s sexually attracted to this “friend” and while she loves, she wanted me to give her a free pass. This has caused some problems between us. I don’t feel comfortable with it at all, but at the same time she’s not my prisoner!

We’ve both been repressed sexually all our lives, and it hurts me that I’m not comfortable with this. Just so you know, she’s VERY MUCH against giving me a free post. I even asked her if she would like to have a threesome (just to see if we could find a compromise) and she told me that it would be “weird!” At the moment we’re good with each other, but she’s heavily floating the idea of the free  pass, and she’s still friends with her gym “friend.”

Don’t know what to do. Please give me some advice.

tl;dr
My wife befriended a guy she’s sexually attracted to and wants a one-way free pass.","Eşim ve ben neredeyse yıllardır mutlu bir evliliğimiz var, ikimiz de geleneksel ailelerde büyüdük ve hayatımızın erken dönemlerinde birbirimize aşık olduk, bunun sonucunda ikimiz de cinsel olarak keşfetme fırsatı bulamadık, bu benim için tamamen sorun değil, o benim istediğim her şey ve yakın zamana kadar onun için de aynı şeyin söylenebileceğinden emindim

bu yüzden son bir yıldır eşim ilk başta ücretsiz geçiş fikrini ortaya attı, bunun sadece bir şaka olduğunu ve buna katlanıp seks yapmamıza yol açacağını düşündüm, ancak sonra bunun gerçekten ciddi olduğunu fark ettim, işler biraz daha karmaşık hale geldi

bu noktada sinirlendim ve ona ne olduğunu sordum, bana doğrudan bu arkadaşına cinsel olarak ilgi duyduğunu ve onu sevmesine rağmen istediğini söyledi ona ücretsiz geçiş izni vermem aramızda bazı sorunlara yol açtı bundan hiç rahat hissetmiyorum ama aynı zamanda o benim tutsağım değil

ikimiz de hayatımız boyunca cinsel olarak bastırıldık ve bundan rahat olmamam beni üzüyor sadece bilmen için bana ücretsiz bir gönderi verme konusunda çok karşı olduğunu söyledim hatta ona üçlü yapmak isteyip istemediğini sordum sadece bir uzlaşma bulup bulamayacağımızı görmek için ve bana bunun şu anda garip olacağını söyledi birbirimizle iyiyiz ama ücretsiz geçiş fikrini çokça ortaya atıyor ve hala spor salonundaki arkadaşıyla arkadaş

"I (36M) have a child (16) my child, who perfere to be refered to as my son was born Intersex, it took longer then I would care to admit to get him diagnosed, we live in japan, and sometimes they don't take these things seriously.

Basically, he was born with XX chromosomes but has testosterone and looks and sounds as if he were a male, but he also has female parts, aside from the chest.

Sadly, his mother, my wife passed away 8 years ago now, by commiting suicide, and she isn't here to help us anymore, so its always really just been us two. he goes to weekly doctors appointments, and I try my best to help him but I have no clue what I'm doing.

I never expected to have a child who wasn't born into a binary gender, and I know his uterus doesn't work, and he is sometimes in lots of pain and at risk of getting cancer.

but the point of this is, I don't know how to comfort him. he was talking to this girl, but she had cut it off since she got teased for liking the (his words) ""freak kid"" I think he's depressed, and I've been trying to help him and show him how to love himself. but therapy has never worked for him, and im genuinely not well versed in all of this.

another thing I'm stuck on is he wants to get a surgery, to remove his testicle, but im aware of how surgeries can be weaponized against intersex people, and I don't want him to do something so serve incase it goes wrong or ruins his body. but I also know that he would feel less like an 'outcast' or 'freak' if he atleast somewhat fit a norm, and all I want for him is to be happy and love his body.

I dont want his depressive state to get worse, I can't loose another person, but I also want him to learn to love and accept himself without change, put it this way; for me, it seems like an already semi attractive woman getting tons of cosmetic surgeries and she ends up being worse off then before.

does anyone have any advice on what I should do? should I get him the surgery, should I try some alternative methods of therapy/help to love himself? any comments are appreciated.","bir çocuğum var, oğlum olarak anılmayı tercih eden çocuğum interseks olarak doğdu, teşhis konması için kabul etmek istediğimden daha uzun sürdü, japonya'da yaşıyoruz ve bazen bu şeyleri ciddiye almıyorlar

"I go to a social dance studio where people dance with a lot of partners and chat sometimes while dancing. There is a woman there who looked very familiar, and after a few weeks I finally figured out why: she was a nude model around 15 years ago. I'm leaning toward not mentioning it because of the awkwardness and possible creepiness. On the other hand, it can be awkward to know things about a person without letting them know you know. If they find out later that you knew the thing for a long time without mentioning it, they could feel even more embarrassed.","insanların çok sayıda partnerle dans ettiği ve bazen dans ederken sohbet ettiği bir sosyal dans stüdyosuna gidiyorum; orada çok tanıdık görünen bir kadın var ve birkaç hafta sonra neden yıllar önce çıplak model olduğunu sonunda anladım; garipliği ve olası ürperticiliği nedeniyle bundan bahsetmemeye meyilliyim; öte yandan, bir kişi hakkında onlara söylemeden bir şeyler bilmek garip olabilir; eğer daha sonra, uzun süredir bir şeyi bildiğinizi ve bundan bahsetmediğinizi öğrenirlerse, daha da utanabilirler."

We met at a downtown coffee spot, and when it came time to order, I went for a croissant and Americano. She, on the other hand, went all out on the menu, talking about wanting ""good food"" and practically ordering half the darn thing. We chatted, and when it was time to settle the bill, she looks me dead in the eyes and suggests splitting it. I was like, nah that's  not happening. She then flips out, calls me GREEDY in front of everyone, pays her part in a hurry, and murmurs to herself how she wishes she'd never met me because I apparently always say no to everything, and bails, leaving me in shock. Later that day, our mutual friend gave me a call, urging me to clarify why I seemingly embarrassed her and suggesting I apologize for refusing to split the bill. Now, I'm torn because while I believe I stood up for myself, there's a part of me wondering if I should've just agreed and covered the tab to avoid any fallout.","altı gün önce çok yakın olmadığım bir kız bana telefon açtı, çok yakın olmasak da görüşmek istiyordu, evet dedim, şehir merkezindeki bir kahve dükkanında tanıştık ve sipariş zamanı geldiğinde kruvasan ve americano sipariş ettim, o ise menüde her şeyi söyledi, iyi yemek istediğinden bahsetti ve neredeyse konuştuğumuz şeyin yarısını sipariş etti, hesabı ödeme zamanı geldiğinde gözlerimin içine baktı ve hesabı bölmeyi önerdi, ben de ""hayır bu olmayacak"" dedim, sonra çılgına döndü, herkesin önünde bana açgözlü dedi, aceleyle kendi payını ödedi ve kendi kendine keşke benimle hiç tanışmasaydım diye mırıldandı, çünkü görünüşe göre her şeye hayır diyorum ve beni şokta bırakarak kaçtı, o günün ilerleyen saatlerinde ortak arkadaşımız beni aradı, neden onu utandırdığımı açıklamam için ısrar etti ve hesabı bölmeyi reddettiğim için özür dilememi önerdi, şimdi kendimi savunduğuma inansam da, herhangi bir olumsuzluk yaşamamak için kabul edip hesabı ödemem gerekip gerekmediğini merak eden bir yanım var, bu yüzden kararsızım"

They need to inform their mother now and are devastated. I want to be there and I know they want me around specially now but I feel like a burden (mainly because I’m holding my grief). 
What can I do?
We are not blood related but are friends for many years and we always introduce each other as siblings, even though we are not. I’m lost and devastated and afraid of being a burden to them because of how I am already feeling sad.

"Neer thought I’d be writing something like this, but here we are. Last night, my boyfriend (24M) and I (22F) were watching a movie together, and it had one of those typical Hollywood sex scenes—perfect lighting, over-the-top moans, the whole fantasy package. We’ve watched plenty of movies like this before, so I didn’t think much of it, until he made a comment that I’m still trying to wrap my head around.

Right in the middle of the scene, he turns to me and says, “Why don’t you sound like that when we have sex?”

I was *shocked*. Like, who says that to their girlfriend? I just sat there for a second, completely thrown off. I didn’t know what to say. I felt embarrassed, angry, and honestly, a bit worthless all at the same time. It's bad enough to be compared to someone on screen who’s portraying this unrealistic idea of sex, but to have my boyfriend openly say he wishes I sounded different in bed? That’s a whole new level of hurt.

Now I’m stuck questioning everything. Is he not satisfied with me? Does he expect me to act like some kind of porn star? It feels like I’ll never be enough for him if he’s comparing me to fake moans from a movie. I always thought we had good chemistry, but now I can’t stop overthinking every little thing.

I don’t know how to bring this up with him without sounding insecure or making things worse, but it’s really bothering me. It’s like he doesn’t even realize how humiliating it is to be compared to some girl on a screen who’s literally acting. Has anyone else had to deal with this kind of comparison? How do I confront him about this without it blowing up into a fight?","böyle bir şey yazacağımı hiç düşünmezdim ama işte dün gece erkek arkadaşım m ve ben birlikte bir film izliyorduk ve tipik hollywood seks sahnelerinden birine sahiptik, mükemmel ışıklandırma, abartılı inlemeler, tüm fantezi paketi, daha önce bunun gibi birçok film izledik, bu yüzden kafamı hala toparlamaya çalıştığım bir yorum yapana kadar pek düşünmedim

sahnenin tam ortasında bana döndü ve seks yaparken neden böyle konuşmuyorsun dedi

şok oldum, kim kız arkadaşına böyle bir şey söyler ki, bir saniyeliğine orada oturdum, tamamen şaşkına döndüm, ne diyeceğimi bilmiyordum, utandım, öfkelendim ve dürüst olmak gerekirse biraz değersiz hissettim, hepsi aynı anda ekranda bu gerçekçi olmayan seks fikrini canlandıran biriyle karşılaştırılmak yeterince kötü ama erkek arkadaşımın yatakta farklı duyulmamı istediğini açıkça söylemesi bambaşka bir acı seviyesi

şimdi her şeyi sorgulamaya takılıp kaldım, benden memnun değil mi, benden bir tür porno yıldızı gibi davranmamı mı bekliyor, beni sahte inlemelerle karşılaştırıyorsa onun için asla yeterli olmayacağım gibi hissediyorum bir filmden beri aramızda iyi bir kimya olduğunu düşünürdüm ama şimdi her küçük şeyi fazla düşünmekten kendimi alamıyorum

bunu ona güvensiz görünmeden veya işleri daha da kötüleştirmeden nasıl söyleyeceğimi bilmiyorum ama bu beni gerçekten rahatsız ediyor sanki ekranda tam anlamıyla oyunculuk yapan bir kızla karşılaştırılmanın ne kadar aşağılayıcı olduğunun farkında bile değilmiş gibi başka biri bu tür karşılaştırmalarla uğraşmak zorunda kaldı mı bu konuda onunla nasıl yüzleşebilirim ve kavga etmeden"
"During the pandemic, we got to know the elderly woman who lives in the neighbouring building alone.  She walks with a walker and is generally pretty frail so when her family couldn’t come and see her, we stepped in to help with shopping, watering the garden, keeping her company, etc.

Obviously, things have returned to normal now and she sees her family a couple of times a week. 

However, about four months ago, my partner got a frantic voicemail from her saying she needed help. He was away at the time so sent me round there. I went and she handed me a shopping list of random items and asked me to go and get them for her because she was desperate. On the list was something like dark chocolate, a newspaper, hand cream, diet lemonade and a comb.  Random, but I gave her the benefit of a doubt.  A week later, she does it again but this time for cherries. When I gently asked her if her family were helping her with her shopping, she snapped at me and said she’d run out which is why she was asking. Hardly an ‘emergency’ as she said on her voicemail.

Since then, she’s called with various ‘emergencies’ like putting the curtain back on the rail, replacing the lightbulb that’s in a cupboard, getting her slow cooker out from under the sink, the list goes on. Every time, she makes it sound like something awful has happened and sounds like she can’t breathe. You get there and she’s talking like normal. 

My partner spotted her daughter outside and asked if they’d noticed any change in her behaviour and explained what was happening. She said she was going to talk to her but we never heard anymore. 

Then my partner got another one of these ‘urgent’ calls but called her out on it, asking what exactly did she want. It took some doing but eventually she said her friend was round, she’d seen his car, and wondered if he’d drop her back to the train station!!

He’s strongly of the opinion that he wants to block her number and tell her to F off (not literally in those words). She’s in her late eighties and it just doesn’t sit right with me. He says he refuses to go round there anymore so it’s about to be solely my responsibility but I hate the thought that she really does need something urgent and we don’t go and something awful happens. Plus, what if she is dementing (which wouldn’t surprise me).

What’s the best way to handle this?","pandemi sırasında komşu binada tek başına yaşayan yaşlı bir kadınla tanıştık, yürüteçle yürüyor ve genelde oldukça güçsüz, bu yüzden ailesi gelip onu göremediğinde alışverişe yardım etmek, bahçeyi sulamak, ona eşlik etmek vb. için devreye girdik

açıkçası her şey normale döndü ve haftada birkaç kez ailesini görüyor

ancak yaklaşık dört ay önce partnerim ondan yardıma ihtiyacı olduğunu söyleyen telaşlı bir sesli mesaj aldı, o sırada evde değildi, bu yüzden beni oraya gönderdi, ben de gittim ve bana rastgele ürünlerden oluşan bir alışveriş listesi verdi ve çaresiz olduğu için gidip bunları almamı istedi, listede bitter çikolata, gazete, el kremi, diyet limonata ve bir tarak gibi şeyler vardı, rastgele ama ona şüphe duyma avantajını verdim bir hafta sonra bunu tekrar yaptı ama bu sefer kiraz için, ailesinin alışverişte ona yardım edip etmediğini nazikçe sorduğumda bana çıkıştı ve bittiğini söyledi, bu yüzden sesli mesajında ​​söylediği gibi acil bir durum değildi

o zamandan beri perdeyi tekrar takmak gibi çeşitli acil durumlarda aradı dolaptaki ampulü değiştiren ray, yavaş pişiriciyi lavabonun altından çıkarmak, her seferinde korkunç bir şey olmuş gibi sesler çıkardığında ve nefes alamıyormuş gibi ses çıkardığında liste uzar gider, oraya vardığında normal şekilde konuşmaya başlar

partnerim kızını dışarıda gördü ve davranışlarında bir değişiklik fark edip etmediklerini sordu ve olanları anlattı, onunla konuşacağını söyledi ama daha fazla haber alamadık

sonra partnerim bu acil aramalardan birini daha aldı ama onu arayıp tam olarak ne istediğini sordu, biraz uğraştı ama sonunda arkadaşının orada olduğunu, arabasını gördüğünü ve onu tren istasyonuna bırakıp bırakmayacağını merak ettiğini söyledi

numarasını engellemek ve ona siktirip gitmesini söylemek istediğine dair güçlü bir fikri var, tam olarak bu kelimelerle değil, seksenlerinin sonlarında ve bu bana doğru gelmiyor, artık oraya gitmeyi reddettiğini söylüyor, bu yüzden tamamen benim sorumluluğum olacak ama onun gerçekten acil bir şeye ihtiyacı olduğunu ve biz gitmiyoruz ve korkunç bir şey olursa ve ya bunamışsa, ki bu beni şaşırtmaz

"My husband birthday is coming up and I'm  in the process of planning his party. As the title implies he has a twin brother. What is the etiquette for inviting his twin? Obviously my BIL will be invited and I have no problem singing happy birthday ect. to both of them. I'm asking more in terms of how to phrase the invitation, as this party is happening at my house and I'm doing all the leg work it's primarily for my husband. Is it offensive if I send BIL an invite to ""come celebrate husbands birthday""? 

Probably overthinking this but I appreciate any insight. 

Edit: As many commenters have asked, no, the party is not happening on their actual birthday. My husband's relationship with his twin has been turbulent in the past but they are currently on good terms. Ik previously my husband has felt overshadowed by his twin so I wanted a day to make him feel special but also without causing unnecessary family drama.","kocamın doğum günü yaklaşıyor ve partisini planlama sürecindeyim, başlıktan da anlaşılacağı gibi ikiz kardeşi var ikizini davet etme görgü kuralları nelerdir tabii ki kayınvalidem de davet edilecek ve ikisine de doğum günü şarkısı söylemekte sorun yaşamıyorum daveti nasıl ifade edeceğim konusunda daha fazla soru soruyorum çünkü bu parti benim evimde oluyor ve tüm ayak işlerini ben yapıyorum öncelikle kocam için kayınvalideme kocamın doğum gününü kutlaması için davet gönderirsem bu rahatsız edici olur mu

"A girl [15f] manipulated me [15m], into getting her pregnant.

I am really freaking out right now and have also thought of ending it all.

3 months ago, a girl [15f] approached me [15m] and we quickly became friends, and would talk with each other all day round in classes. We never met each other outside of classes, and she rarely uses and social media or texting apps in general.

A week ago, she told me that she was luckily invited to a party hosted by the seniors who are graduating soon; and wanted to accompany her. I accepted her invite since this would be our first time meeting outside of school and frankly speaking I had developed some feelings for her by then.

Its the middle of the night, and both of us sneaked out of our houses and went together to the party. We had 2 bottle of alcoholic beers and then were denied by the host due to our age: so angrily both of us went outside to breath in some fresh air. On our way, she asked me to wait a bit outside so she can go to the restroom. I then waited outside the door, and then she emmerged with two plastic glasses of a liquid of some sort which she said was ""Kool-aid"". We drank together, and then my head started hurting and the last thing I remember was both of us running. When I woke up a couple hours later, I was half naked and was on ground in the woods. I then realised she was sleeping right next to me fully naked. I woke her up and she acted surprised and freaked out. She said we had sex, and we just had to accept each other as a couple and move on. I didn't say anything out of embarresment and ran home, I was yelled at a lot by my parents for staying out all night and also for my torn,dirty and smelly clothes. 

I was happy a bit, that I finally lost my virginity to a girl I liked a lot.

3 days go by, and she comes to my house, into my room and started crying; showing me the pregnancy test and saying that she is pregnant. My head started hurting a lot, and I shed a few tears all while looking dead. She asks me again and again on what to do, and doesnt want to get an abortion cuz of her traditional family. I tell her that we have plenty of time to think and if she ever feels tensed then to just meet me.

Yesterday, her best friend meets me during recess and tells me that, [15f] had planned all this out; to manipulate me into making her preg so I have no choice but to be with her for the rest of her life. I ofcourse called this bs but then she showed me the voice recording of that girl admitting all while laughing calling herself a ""genius"". The best friend asked me to please not tell the girl about that recording. I was heartbroken

The girl has called me about 20 times by now, buy i have been avoiding her.

Guys what should i do? I am in literal tears

Update 1: Thanks for all the advices. The most repeated and solid statement i got is that ; the baby is likely not mine... 

This made me happy that I dont have to take the burden but at the same time broke my heart that the girl would go to such measures...

I have talked to my elder brother, and he said that we will get the paternity and std test soon.. I also talked to my school councelor but she told me to ""accept"" the outcomes even if its not my baby since she is a ""hopeless"" innocent girl; and that i need to ""help"" her get through it since she trusted me even though her method was wrong. I call bs on that and just walked out nodding.

I also informed my parents that I was raped and drugged but they just yelled at me alot and told me to apologize to the girl for even calling it a rape. According to them it was a COCSA (child on child sexual assault). I have been deprived of my TV time which kinda sucks..

I will get the recording from that girl tommorow; I have told her that i want to hear it once more in school just to make sure its not AI, while i would be secretly recording it with my own phone. She agreed.

As of the main villain here, I talked to her on call cuz it was really annoying that she called every 3 minutes and i got worried that she would cry to my parents before i told them.. Anyways i acted like i was not aware of her lying. She is now asking, nah i mean forcing me to get a part time job or hustle money. She called it the ""Plan B"" if her parents dont agree, she will run away with me. Nevertheless, I will not let this happen and get ride of this girl from my life as soon as i can...

I am really pissed off right now and at the same time feel very heavy. Its as if I am trying to scream in agony but the sound wouldnt come out of my mouth but rather just air. Thats the best explaination i can give of my current mental mind rn... i also do not think i can trust a female ever again after what had happened to me, i am not saying this as a 7 year old who has a grunch but i am really serious. I was heartbroken, and have accepted that women can be both terrifying and beautiful at the same time..

UPDATE 2: UPDATE: Thanks for all the advices.. it really means a lot to me that some can understand. One advice that I saw the most in this post was ""Call the cops""; I will cover that here

I finally got the recording unethically. I asked that girl to show me the recording once more and i secretly recorded it with my phone. I now have the evidence i need

My brother's friend is a doctor, and he also believes that she was already pregnant since 3 days is not enough. He said that she is most likely between her 8th-12th week since the vomiting starts then. He is very happy to help and is ready to take the NIPP test only when the girl gives consent for it.

I have asked her to take the paternity test, she thought that i was not believing her and cried, cussed me out. Nevertheless she just called me and has agreed to take the NIPP test. I don't know why she agreed but she did.

We will be taking the test within 8 hours. I still haven't showed her the recording. I will show it to her once the results are back. If it isn't mine (which is most likely going to happen) I will just show her the recording and report her to the cops if she still lies. If it is mine (Which is impossible), then I will just go to the cops and show them the recording..

My uncle is a cop and I think we have a good chance of making that case, though If it does go to the courts, I wouldn't have money to get a good lawyer since my parents are totally against it. I am pretty sure we will win though, cuz we have all the evidence we need.

As for getting therapy, I still dont think i am ready yet to talk about such a sensitive thing irl to a stranger for days.

Thanks a lot you guys, i am so grateful for all of your positive responses, I really thought I would be blamed for it just like how my parents and the counsellor did. I will post an update as soon as I get the paternity test results.

babalık testini yaptırmasını istedim, ona inanmadığımı düşündü ve bana küfür etti, yine de beni aradı ve nipp testini yaptırmayı kabul etti, neden kabul ettiğini bilmiyorum ama yaptı

birkaç saat içinde testi yapacağız, hala kaydı ona göstermedim, sonuçlar gelince ona göstereceğim, eğer benim değilse ki büyük ihtimalle olacak, sadece kaydı ona göstereceğim ve hala yalan söylüyorsa onu polise bildireceğim eğer benimse ki bu imkansız, o zaman sadece polise gidip kaydı göstereceğim

amcam bir polis ve bence bu davayı açma şansımız yüksek, eğer mahkemeye gidiyor iyi bir avukat tutacak param yok çünkü ailem buna tamamen karşı, kazanacağımızdan oldukça eminim çünkü ihtiyacımız olan tüm kanıtlara sahibiz

"So basically last night I (24) female and boyfriend (31) male were having a conversation in bed about sex, and why some men feel uncomfortable with butt play or their partners touching their butts. His explanation was essentially that men don’t like sex that puts them in the degrade position, and that being penetrated was degrading. I felt a little offended by that and asked him what he meant. He doubled down, essentially saying that women who have sex are being degraded. I asked , “ are you saying that because I’ve had sex in the past I was degraded and essentially less than, but your sexual experience is fine”, and he said yes, and that men having sexual experiences is different and there’s only specific things that men can do during sex that degrades them, like giving a girl oral and getting nothing in return and being pegged. We been together for a year now, and so far it’s been fairly good, I know he has some issues with sex as a whole because when he was younger, he was not as desirable and didn’t get any female attention. I got mad, we argued, then I left the room. I’m quite upset about this and honestly it makes me not want to be intimate with him at all and I’m considering ending this relationship. I don’t want to be with someone who views the act of sex as something done to me not with me. Am I crazy and being to rash, is this something we can workout or talk about or should I just move on?


Update:

Thank you to everyone who gave me advice, it was much appreciated!  So after the whole fight we went a couple days not really addressing the issue, he ignored it and acted like it never happened and I was still considerably mad, it all came to a head and we finally had a conversation. At first it didn’t go well, he kinda just spent the time discussing why he feels the way he feels, using men’s negative treatment and views on women as a justification for why he views sex for women as degrading (because most men view it that way). A couple days ago we finally had an actual conversation and he finally opened up to me. He said that he’s been feeling like our sex life isn’t good, I don’t cum much and it seems like I’m not entirely into it. He feels like he’s not special to me and just another guy I’m dating before I find my husband. Then he said that his words came from a place of insecurity and he simply lashed out at me. I come from a fairly conservative background and it’s taken be a long time to feel comfortable with my body and sex as a whole, and I told him that it’s not him, and that I’m just not completely opened sexually but that’s something we could work on, and that being rude and lashing out was not a good response to feeling insecure. I also expressed that what he said hurt and I’m not sure if I’m gonna feel comfortable anytime soon having sex with him. It’s just kinda ironic that he wants me to enjoy sex and be sexually liberated but in the same breath says that women having sex are being degraded and wonders why I struggle being opened sexually. We’ve been having issues for a while now, and I guess that conversation was the tipping point. There’s been a few moments in our relationship where when he’s feeling insecure or uncomfortable he just lashes out, yells or says hurtful things. I think a lot of his insecurities comes from our differences in faith, I’m religious and he’s not. I had thought that it wouldn’t be an issue, as long as I love him, but I think we are too incompatible. I told him that this isn’t working for me and that I’m unhappy, and when I think of a life with him, all I see is him being inconsiderate and me being berated. He still thinks we can work it out, but at least for me, this relationship is over.

güncelleme

bana tavsiye veren herkese teşekkür ederim çok takdir edildi bu yüzden tüm kavgadan sonra birkaç gün boyunca gerçekten konuyu ele almadık o görmezden geldi ve hiç olmamış gibi davrandı ve ben hala oldukça kızgındım her şey patlak verdi ve sonunda ilk başta bir konuşma yaptık iyi gitmedi sadece neden hissettiğini tartışarak zaman geçirdi erkeklerin olumsuz muamelesini ve kadınlara bakış açısını kullanarak neden kadınlar için seksi aşağılayıcı olarak gördüğünü haklı çıkardı çünkü çoğu erkek bunu böyle görüyor birkaç gün önce sonunda gerçek bir konuşma yaptık ve sonunda bana açıldı seks hayatımızın iyi olmadığını hissettiğini söyledi çok fazla boşalmıyorum ve tamamen içine girmiyorum gibi görünüyor benim için özel olmadığını ve sadece kocamı bulmadan önce çıktığım bir erkek gibi hissettiğini söyledi sonra sözlerinin güvensizlikten kaynaklandığını ve bana saldırdığını söyledi Oldukça muhafazakar bir geçmişten geliyorum ve vücudumla ve seksimle ilgili olarak kendimi rahat hissetmem uzun zaman aldı ve ona bunun kendisi olmadığını ve cinsel olarak tamamen açık olmadığımı ama bunun üzerinde çalışabileceğimiz bir şey olduğunu ve kaba olmanın ve saldırganlığın güvensiz hissetmeye karşı iyi bir tepki olmadığını söyledim. Ayrıca söylediklerinin beni incittiğini ve yakın zamanda onunla seks yaparken rahat hissedip hissedemeyeceğimden emin olmadığımı ifade ettim. Sadece seksin tadını çıkarmamı ve cinsel olarak özgür olmamı istemesi ama aynı nefesle kadınların seks yapmasının aşağılandığını ve cinsel olarak açılmakta neden zorlandığımı merak etmesi biraz ironik. Bir süredir sorunlar yaşıyoruz ve sanırım bu konuşma dönüm noktasıydı. İlişkimizde güvensiz veya rahatsız hissettiğinde sadece saldırganlaştığı, bağırdığı veya incitici şeyler söylediği birkaç an oldu. Bence güvensizliğinin çoğu inanç farklılıklarımızdan kaynaklanıyor. Ben dindarım ve o dindar değil. Onu sevdiğim sürece bunun bir sorun olmayacağını düşünmüştüm ama sanırım çok uyumsuzuz. Ona bunun benim için işe yaramadığını ve mutsuzum ve onunla bir hayat düşündüğümde gördüğüm tek şey onun düşüncesiz olması ve benim azarlanmam o hala bir şekilde halledebileceğimizi düşünüyor ama en azından benim için bu ilişki bitti"
I’m a bridal hairstylist who is white and I recently had a bride inquire about my services for her upcoming wedding. She found me through social media which is normally how my brides find me and even though she is private I can see in her profile pic that she is African American. I have no problem with this but I do feel like I am under qualified because I have never worked with/styled African American textured hair for a wedding before. I would hate to not be able to give her what she is hoping for on her big day or damage her hair simply because I am not experienced or knowledgeable on the subject. I did go to cosmetology school but what we learned about formal styling in general was limited and I had to teach myself everything I know now. I feel like I should give her a heads up and if she still wants to book me then I’m willing to try but idk? Would that be offensive to do? Will take any advice!,Ben beyaz tenli bir gelin saç stilistiyim ve yakın zamanda yaklaşan düğünü için hizmetlerim hakkında bilgi almak isteyen bir gelinim oldu. Beni sosyal medya aracılığıyla buldu. Gelinlerim beni genelde böyle bulur. Özel biri olmasına rağmen profil resminde Afro-Amerikan olduğunu görebiliyorum. Bununla ilgili bir sorunum yok ama daha önce bir düğünde Afro-Amerikan dokulu saç stiliyle çalışmadığım için yetersiz kaldığımı hissediyorum. Büyük gününde ona umduğu şeyi verememek veya sadece konuyla ilgili deneyimim veya bilgim olmadığı için saçına zarar vermek istemem. Güzellik okuluna gittim ama genel olarak resmi stil hakkında öğrendiklerimiz sınırlıydı ve bildiğim her şeyi kendi kendime öğretmek zorunda kaldım.

"Today my child (14) came out as nonbinary. I want to be supportive and accepting but I’m not sure what to do, does anyone have any advice?","bugün çocuğum nonbinary olarak ortaya çıktı, destekleyici ve kabul edici olmak istiyorum ama ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, herhangi bir tavsiyesi olan var mı?"
"We've been going on holidays with our close friends for many years, every year. A couple of years ago they had a son, and recently they had a daughter. Initially, it wasn't a problem for us, and we continued travelling with them. However, when the boy was 4 or 5, the trips became awful. Basically, it's just us trying to survive without hurting anyone's feelings. The kids are extremely misbehaved, loud and the parents don't even try to control them in any way. If they wake up at 6 am and start screaming, we have to get up too. Their mother herself doesn't even try to be quiet from the moment they wake up. We lie in bed listening to kids screaming and their mom loudly telling them to get up/go to the bathroom/get dressed. When we get up, there's just more running and screaming.   
The older boy is a nightmare. I regret to say this about a child, but I absolutely hate the kid. He is malicious, attention-seeking, gets physically aggressive. He once hit my husband with an open hand because he was angry and threw a pencil in my face when I told him to stop screaming. It actually hurt. His parents? He suffered absolutely no consequences for physically attacking us.   
It is absolutely impossible to play a game or just sit and talk in peace and quiet, because he's constantly sitting with us, nagging us, wants us to include him in every activity (God forbid we pull out cards or a board game, we simply cannot, without him breathing down our necks, grabbing our things, dropping them on the floor). His parents do not react. Heck, his parents will go have a nap and leave him with us, free babysitters.   
We cannot play, cannot switch on the TV (because the kid will torment you until you let him watch cartoons). Last year I mostly spent the final days of the trip in our room, refusing to leave.  What for?

In addition, these trips are pointless for us as a group. We don't do things together any more, all their time is just activities for children. They want to see different places, eat different things, do different things. Even when we decide to have a barbecue, they never sit down at the table with us at this point. They'll just eat their food whenever they want, and we just prepare stuff for ourselves and eat it at a different time. What kind of group trip is it?

My husband says we cannot just tell them it doesn't work for us any more, because we don't want to lose our closest friends. On the other hand, he also says we cannot ever tell them if we decide to spend the next holidays with another group of friends, because it'll trigger a conflict. They won't understand. 

How can we get out of this situation? I do not want to lose friends either, but at this point I just feel terrorized.","yakın arkadaşlarımızla uzun yıllardır her yıl tatile gidiyoruz birkaç yıl önce bir oğulları oldu ve yakın zamanda bir kızları oldu ilk başlarda bizim için sorun değildi ve onlarla seyahat etmeye devam ettik ancak oğlan olduğunda veya geziler korkunç hale geldiğinde temelde sadece kimsenin duygularını incitmeden hayatta kalmaya çalışıyoruz çocuklar aşırı derecede yaramaz ve gürültülü ve ebeveynler onları hiçbir şekilde kontrol etmeye çalışmıyor sabah uyandıklarında ve çığlık atmaya başladıklarında biz de kalkmak zorundayız anneleri bile uyandıkları andan itibaren sessiz olmaya çalışmıyor yatakta yatıyoruz çocukların çığlıklarını ve annelerinin yüksek sesle onlara kalkmalarını, banyoya gitmelerini, kalktığımızda giyinmelerini söylediğini dinliyoruz sadece daha fazla koşuşturma ve çığlık atma var 
büyük oğlan tam bir kabus bunu bir çocuk hakkında söylediğim için üzgünüm ama çocuktan kesinlikle nefret ediyorum kötü niyetli ilgi arıyor fiziksel olarak saldırganlaşıyor bir keresinde öfkelendiği için kocama açık eliyle vurdu ve ona çığlık atmayı bırakmasını söylediğimde suratıma kalem fırlattı aslında ailesini incitti bize fiziksel olarak saldırdığı için kesinlikle hiçbir sonuçla karşılaşmadı 
bir oyun oynamak kesinlikle imkansız veya sadece oturup sessizce konuşun çünkü sürekli yanımızda oturuyor ve bizi sıkıştırıyor her aktiviteye onu dahil etmemizi istiyor tanrı korusun kartlar veya bir masa oyunu çıkarsak bile bunu onun ensemde nefes almadan yapamayız eşyalarımızı alıp yere düşürüyor ailesi tepki vermiyor hatta ailesi gidip uyuyacak ve onu bize ücretsiz bebek bakıcıları bırakacak
oynayamayız televizyonu açamayız çünkü çocuk çizgi film izlemesine izin verene kadar sizi rahatsız edecek geçen yıl çoğunlukla yolculuğun son günlerini odamızda geçirdim ne için ayrılmayı reddederek

ayrıca bu geziler bizim için bir grup olarak anlamsız artık birlikte bir şeyler yapmıyoruz tüm zamanları sadece çocuklar için aktiviteler farklı yerler görmek farklı şeyler yemek farklı şeyler yapmak istiyorlar hatta biz barbekü yapmaya karar verdiğimizde bile bu noktada asla bizimle masaya oturmuyorlar istedikleri zaman yemeklerini yiyorlar ve biz sadece kendimiz için bir şeyler hazırlayıp farklı bir zamanda yiyoruz bu ne tür bir grup gezisi

kocam artık onlara bizim için işe yaramadığını söyleyemeyeceğimizi çünkü en yakın arkadaşlarımızı kaybetmek istemediğimizi söylüyor Öte yandan, bir sonraki tatili başka bir arkadaş grubuyla geçirmeye karar verirsek bunu onlara asla söyleyemeyeceğimizi söylüyor çünkü bu, onların anlayamayacağı bir çatışmayı tetikleyecek

Bu durumdan nasıl kurtulabiliriz? Ben de arkadaşlarımı kaybetmek istemiyorum ama bu noktada sadece dehşete kapılmış hissediyorum"
"I really didn’t want to come to reddit but I’m in desperate need of some advice. I don’t know what to do this whole thing is such a big mess. I’m also starting to feel bad of my decision and my friends that I do have are saying I’m being too harsh on my wife and I shouldn’t treat a lady like this but I’m terribly hurt 

My wife of 8 years had a 1 year long affair with a man that knows she’s married and has children. I found out about this recently by looking through her phone after I caught her in some lies. Her stories just started to get worse. She was such a good liar in the start of her affair but now her stories were just sounding goofy

The home is under my name. I paid for our home. My wife is a stay at home mom. We have 2 children under 5 years old

I was so angry when I found out about the affair, I packed some of her things in a bag and told her to go. She tried fighting to stay and make our marriage work for the kids. But she didn’t deny she had feelings for this man she has been seeing so I didn’t even wanna try since she not only had sex with this guy for a year, she also developed feelings for this guy 

My wife has our joint account card and she also took my personal credit card under my name and I saw she used it to get a hotel overnight and she’s been staying there this week. The kids are obviously with me. I have family telling me to cancel my cards and report her to the police for theft and they told me to leave her high and dry but my friends are telling me I’m being too hard on her and I should just forgive her and make it work since custody battles are harder for men. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to have a harder life if I divorce her. Right now, I just wish I never met her 

She came by twice to the house to try to reconcile. Shes apologized. She’s leaving me 100s of voice calls, miscalled, and texts

"Was hoping for a nice Memorial Day hike with the family and as we're unloading our car a religious couple +4 kiddos tried to hand me a religious pamphlet. I said no thanks. She then walked to my 5yo w/ the pamphlet and I again said ""no"". She then tried to maneuver around me to reach my daughter.  At this point I began shout ""no, go, walk away"" repeatedly and blocking her with my body. She began yelling religious mumbo jumbo, got onto a rock and her husband yelled ""don't touch my wife"" and whipped out his cell phone to start recording while she preached on the rock. We tried to ignore them for the 5-10 min we prepped our gear but she kept calling to my daughter ""hey little girl, god loves you, jesus loves you"" and even did this to my kiddo on the trail.

"My (23F) parents just suprised me with a puppy as my college graduation present. At first, I was super excited, because who isn't excited to see a puppy? But then reality set in. I start my first full-time job in 2 weeks, where I will be gone from 7:30am to 5:30pm. That's 10 hours straight that the puppy would be home alone in a crate.  I will have to give up my lunch break to let the dog out. Dogs are also very expensive, and I've been saving up to buy a new car since mine broke down. I'll have to Potty train it and puppy proof my house (I do art and I have a bit of jewlery, and there's always little things on the floor it could eat). It's peed on my floor so many times already.

Also, I'm not even a dog person!! I like dogs, and I like my parents dogs, but I'm a cat person. I already have a cat, and he hates other animals. Cats are so much easier than dogs, they are fairly low maintenence animals and they won't try and eat my shoes and electrical cords. 

I'm just not sure what to do. I don't want to seem ungrateful, the dog is adorable, but he's only 8 weeks old and barely weaned or anything. A dog is a huge commitment that I don't think I have time for, and that's nor fair to the dog. I honestly don't understand how people with full time jobs get puppies. I'll never be able to just go on vacation or even just go somewhere for a weekend. With a cat, leave them enough food and water and you can go away for a weekend no problem. I'd have to pay someone to watch the dog or take it with me. 

Any advice is welcome. I don't know if I should tell my parents I'm not ready for a puppy and give him back to them, or if I just need to grow up and learn how to take care of a dog.

"Long story.
About 4 years ago right after I (then 17F) started my freshman year of college, my parents (dad and step mom) gave me a 2 month notice that they were moving out of the country, selling their house, and taking my younger siblings with them halfway across the world (I’m talking they told me in October and left in late December / early January ).

They gave me a month to decide if I was coming with them and to drop out of my current college and move to a place I’d only ever visited… it’s 26 hours away by plane.

I declined because the life I knew was here, I had just enrolled in school and started classes and had no idea, preparation, or warning for what life would be like across the world.

Before my parents left, they said they’d help pay for my college. They stated they’d put $50k towards my education.

It’s been 4 years and I haven’t seen a cent.
I’ve seen my family twice in that time and I’m not sure how to bring this up.

Sure they’ve helped here and there, I’d say in grand total since I was 17 (now turning 22) they’ve helped with maybe $1500 in car fixes. That’s about it.

I’ve had my mom to help me, but she’s all I got in this country now and she’s not rich by any means enough to help in the ways they promised with my education.

I don’t know how to bring this up to them, we already have a rocky relationship given the fact they left me behind in a country with bare minimum help and I only see them maybe once every 2 years.

I realize they’ve moved on and probably dont have the money anymore, but is it even worth bringing up?
I know the worse they could say is no or call me ungrateful but is it better to just move on and accept my losses?

I spent all of college hoping they’d keep their promise and help me out but they’ve never mentioned a thing. One time I brought it up recently they told me to “sell drugs” to pay for my loans.

What would you do? Cut them off? Ask again?

Thanks for the help

onlarla gelip gelmeyeceğime karar vermem ve şu anki üniversitemden ayrılıp sadece birkaç saat uzakta olduğum bir yere taşınmam için bana bir ay verdiler, uçakla saatlerce uzaklıkta

reddettim çünkü bildiğim hayat buradaydı, okula yeni kaydolmuştum ve derslere başlamıştım ve dünyanın öbür ucunda hayatın nasıl olacağı hakkında hiçbir fikrim yoktu

annem ve babam ayrılmadan önce üniversite masraflarımı karşılayacaklarını söylediler, eğitimime katkıda bulunacaklarını söylediler

yıllar geçti ve bir kuruş bile görmedim
o zamandan beri ailemi iki kez gördüm ve bunu nasıl gündeme getireceğimi bilmiyorum

elbette burada ve orada yardım ettiler, toplamda, şu anki doğum günümden beri belki araba tamirlerinde yardımcı oldular, hepsi bu

ive annem bana yardım etti ama bu ülkede sahip olduğum tek şey o ve eğitimimle ilgili vaat ettikleri şekilde bana yardım edebilecek kadar zengin değil

bunu onlara nasıl söyleyeceğimi bilmiyorum, zaten sorunlu bir ilişkimiz var, çünkü beni asgari yardımla bir ülkede bıraktılar ve onları yılda bir kez görüyorum

"I (23f) just recently discovered I'm pregnant. My 25(m) boyfriend wants me to have an abortion. I really want to keep the baby but seeing as I'm currently jobless and a student and don't have any money to support a child at the moment, I don't even have health insurance for the pregnancy journey, I think I should too.

I've tried looking for a job but I'm not getting anywhere and currently I can only do remote jobs but the field I'm in doesn't have that many remote opportunities. I'm Kenyan in the legal field. 

I'm an orphan so asking for help from my parents isn't really a choice. And I'm scared if I keep the baby my boyfriend will leave me.

I'm just looking for some advice, what are my options, for those who decided to keep their babies, how did you boost your financial position, what should I do.


Edit: hello everyone. First of all, I want to say that I am extremely thankful to everyone who took their time to offer me advice. I highly appreciate it.

Let me start first by defending my boyfriend, I think I somehow made that comment in a way that made it sound like he gave me an ultimate, my bad. I asked him that we sit and have an honest conversation, what's the valid option he thinks we have right now, he said an abortion, reasons being we both don't have family we can depend on to help us take care of the baby which means we'd need to have a nanny budget in mind considering he doesn't think I should just give up on my education(I have only 12 months of school left), so after three months, we'd need a nanny to enable to finish my studies. Two we are both currently jobless and students, he can find a job, but he wouldn't be able to provide for his child as he'd like. 
Me being scared if I don't have the abortion he's going to leave me is more of my insecurity issues. I'm a people pleaser and sometimes I feel like if I don't do what someone suggested, they'll stop liking me.


The advice you have provided me is quite eye opening. Most of the options I'm getting are from the US and I can guarantee you I've been doing so much research the few days since I discovered that I know most of those options are not available in Kenya. Most of the advice is what I'd consider tough love but you guys seriously do have a point, the conditions I'm in right now are not conditions that would give my child a comfortable life. And I honestly want the best for them.

The reason why I think I should keep my baby is because I have some saved up money but that would only last us upto the baby being around 4 months old( as long as they are only breastfeeding), it would only last aonth if I had to buy baby food and my food too. And I'm wondering if by that time I can get a way to get more income to supplement what I'll have but the chances are slim which is why I'm also leaning towards abortion. But I feel like I already love the little one too much and I don't want to let go. As some people have clearly pointed out, I'm not a child, I fucked around and found out the consequences and wouldn't not keeping the baby me escaping those consequences.

I don't know what I'll do yet, but I'll keep deliberating on it for one more week before the choice is taken out of my hands. 

Once again thank you everyone for taking your time to help me out. I am honestly so drained 😞😞😞","eğer hamile olduğumu yeni keşfettiysem erkek arkadaşım kürtaj yaptırmamı istiyor gerçekten bebeği tutmak istiyorum ama şu anda işsizim ve öğrenciyim ve şu anda bir çocuğu geçindirecek param yok hamilelik süreci için sağlık sigortam bile yok sanırım ben de almalıyım

sadece biraz tavsiye arıyorum bebeklerini tutmaya karar verenler için seçeneklerim neler mali durumunuzu nasıl iyileştirdiniz ne yapmalıyım

düzenleme herkese merhaba öncelikle bana tavsiye vermek için zaman ayıran herkese çok minnettar olduğumu söylemek istiyorum çok takdir ediyorum

önce erkek arkadaşımı savunarak başlayayım sanırım bir şekilde o yorumu sanki bana en büyük kötülüğümü vermiş gibi yaptım ondan oturup dürüst bir konuşma yapmamızı istedim Şu anda sahip olduğumuzu düşündüğü geçerli seçenek nedir? Nedeni, ikimizin de bebeğe bakmamıza yardımcı olacak güvenebileceğimiz bir ailemizin olmaması, yani aklımızda bir dadı bütçesi olması gerektiği anlamına geliyor, çünkü eğitimimden vazgeçmemem gerektiğini düşünüyor, okulumun bitmesine sadece birkaç ay kaldı, bu yüzden üç ay sonra çalışmalarımı tamamlayabilmem için bir dadıya ihtiyacımız olacak, ikimiz de şu anda işsiziz ve öğrenciyiz, bir iş bulabilir ama çocuğuna bakamaz çünkü 
kürtaj olmazsam beni terk edeceğinden korkuyorum, bu daha çok güvensizlik sorunlarımdan biri, insanları memnun etmeye çalışan biriyim ve bazen birinin önerdiği şeyi yapmazsam benden hoşlanmayacaklarını hissediyorum

Bana verdiğiniz tavsiyeler oldukça göz açıcı, aldığım seçeneklerin çoğu ABD'den ve size garanti edebilirim ki, öğrendiğimden beri birkaç gündür çok fazla araştırma yaptım, bu seçeneklerin çoğunun Kenya'da mevcut olmadığını biliyorum, tavsiyelerin çoğu benim sert sevgi olarak düşündüğüm şey ama sizler gerçekten haklısınız, şu an içinde bulunduğum koşullar çocuğuma rahat bir hayat sağlayacak koşullar değil ve dürüst olmak gerekirse onlar için en iyisini istiyorum

bebeğimi tutmam gerektiğini düşünmemin nedeni biraz biriktirdiğim param olması ama bu para sadece bebeğim aylarca yaşayıncaya kadar bize yeter, sadece emziriyorlarsa sadece bir ay yeter, eğer bebek maması ve kendi yemeğimi de almak zorunda kalsaydım ve o zamana kadar sahip olduklarımı tamamlayacak daha fazla gelir elde etmenin bir yolunu bulabilir miyim diye merak ediyorum ama şansım çok düşük, bu yüzden kürtaja da meyilliyim ama sanki küçüğümü çok fazla seviyorum ve bırakmak istemiyorum çünkü bazı insanlar açıkça belirttiler ki ben bir çocuk değilim, etrafta dolaştım ve sonuçlarını öğrendim ve bebeği tutmamak beni bu sonuçlardan kurtaramaz

henüz ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum ama seçim elimden alınana kadar bir hafta daha üzerinde düşünmeye devam edeceğim

bir kez daha bana yardım etmek için zaman ayırdığınız için hepinize teşekkür ederim, dürüst olmak gerekirse çok bitkinim"
"My daughter has been married for 5 years. They have one 3 year old daughter. I've always liked him and he's been a great husband and father. I've never heard my daughter say anything bad him. 

My daughter sat me down the other day and told me that he's bisexual and he started going out with a guy and they became ""boyfriends"". My daughter said that she's completely ok with it. She told me that he told her he was bisexual when they first started dating(but they kept it to themselves) and that they've been monogamous up until six months ago. 

Then they basically had a conversation and she gave him the ok to find a fwb. From there, He ran into someone he knew from work(different departments). They clicked and eventually it evolved to ""boyfriend"" with my wife's ok. She's met the guy and likes him. He's using protection, etc. So, It seems like nothing is being hidden. There doesn't appear to be any relationship problems between them(from what I can see). She said there's not and the marriage is perfect.

My question is.. how should I respond? I feel a bit blindsided because I never got any clue from him that he was anything but straight. So, it was just surprising. Should I just keep it to myself or talk to him?","kızım yıllardır evli bir yaşında bir kızları var her zaman ondan hoşlandım ve harika bir koca ve baba oldu kızımın ona karşı kötü bir şey söylediğini hiç duymadım

kızım geçen gün beni oturttu ve bana onun biseksüel olduğunu ve bir adamla çıkmaya başladığını ve erkek arkadaş olduklarını söyledi kızım buna tamamen tamam dedi bana ilk çıkmaya başladıklarında ona biseksüel olduğunu söylediğini ama bunu kendilerine sakladıklarını ve altı ay öncesine kadar tek eşli olduklarını söyledi

sonra temelde bir konuşma yaptılar ve ona bir fwb bulması için onay verdi oradan iş yerinden tanıdığı biriyle karşılaştı farklı departmanlar anlaştılar ve sonunda karımın erkek arkadaşıyla erkek arkadaş oldu tamam o adamla tanıştı ve ondan hoşlanıyor koruma falan kullanıyor bu yüzden hiçbir şey saklanmıyor gibi görünüyor aralarında herhangi bir ilişki sorunu yok gördüğüm kadarıyla olmadığını ve evliliklerinin mükemmel olduğunu söyledi

sorum nasıl cevap vermeliyim biraz hazırlıksız yakalandım çünkü ondan hiç heteroseksüel olduğunu anlayamadım bu yüzden sadece şaşırtıcı olan bunu kendime mi saklamalıyım yoksa onunla mı konuşmalıyım"

My depression is at an all time high and my trust is out the window. I can barely sleep and I have barely eaten since finding out. I’m really trying my best to get through this but it’s so incredibly difficult. I feel so sick and disgusting. Any advice would be appreciated. I’ve never been cheated on before and the full extent of the lies is insanely cruel. ","Merhaba, başlığın ne dediğini yeni öğrendim, hala şoktayım.

"I (21F) have the most amazing boyfriend. He is everything I ever wanted and needed in my life. He has done nothing but make me want to be better for myself and him and I can see a future with him. 
My sister (19F)  is a very entitled narcissist. Who believes she deserves the best despite how hellish she makes everyone else’s lives around her. She does what she wants when she wants to do it and always has gotten her way. 
My boyfriend came to meet my family for the first time a while ago and I just haven’t been able to stop thinking about the things she said. 
Before meeting him I showed them photos of him and talked about him and the dates we went on previously. She made comments to me such as “he’s out of your league” and that “he would like a girl like me more then you” and all that stuff and my self confidence is not the best already. My sister also overheard my mom and me talking about him when his job was brought up. And she discovered that he makes a good amount of money. (Which is all my sister looks for in men mostly) 
Upon meeting him my sister did the classic hair down and overdressed more fancy. When talking to him all she did was put me down and ask why he wanted to be with me and made comments such as how I was not the best looking, I have not to nice if clothes compared to her and even bringing up my mental health. 
My boyfriend, bless his soul, told her that he thinks I’m beautiful inside and out and no matter what I wear he will still think I’m beautiful. 
After my sister made those comments my boyfriend in spite took me out shopping and got me a whole punch of new clothes.
My sister saw all the bags and noticed how nicely he was treating me and was jealous. She loves to make comments on how “I live and mooch off my bfs money” but I don’t and that comment really upsets me. 
Anyways after seeing my new clothes. She loves to steal them for herself and lie about it. 
Me and my sister have gotten into arguments in front if my bf, when my sister was in the wrong, and my bf had called her out on her lies and selfish narcissistic attitude. 
Side note my sister has a bf who almost always says nothing but then will come to me in private and say how my sister is being crazy. 
I think it’s wrong she pushes me down to my bf and then tells me in private that he’s to good for me. Like she’s trying to break us up. I just don’t know what to do.","en harika erkek arkadaşım var o hayatımda istediğim ve ihtiyaç duyduğum her şey o tek yaptığı şey kendim ve onun için daha iyi olmamı istemek oldu ve onunla bir gelecek görebiliyorum

erkek arkadaşım ruhuna sağlık, ona içten ve dıştan güzel olduğumu düşündüğünü ve ne giyersem giyeyim yine de güzel olduğumu düşüneceğini söyledi

"back in april this guy texted me on instagram, he started conversation by sending me a dick pic and when i told him i was 14 he didnt seem to care so i just blocked him out of instinct. then about 2-3 weeks later me and my friend (ill call him john) were bored and decided to send him some 🌽 videos we found on twitter. we charged him about $6-$15 per video/picture, i made sure to tell him “i was 16” and he didnt care. this went on for about a week or two until me and john got bored and decided seeing his dick 5 times a day while only getting paid about $10 that we split down the middle wasnt enough. i should also mention that when we started selling to him, me and john made a separate account so he didnt know it was the same person he texted before. me and john came to an agreement that we should block him, but i guess for whatever reason john unblocked him and started talking to him again. 

fast-forward to now and i dont text him much on instagram anymore because i have his number. we talk almost every day and 90% of it is him begging me for nudes and to come fuck him (hes an incel) or me degrading and fat shaming him. i have his address, phone number, full name, the state he lives in, age, all of that. but im not sure how to go about reporting him because ive said some pretty vile things to him that range from threatening to kill him, have him killed, or threatening to send him cp (which im not proud of and was an empty threat). on top of that, john is using one of his other accounts to continue selling to him. my biggest hurdle is reporting him without having my parents find out, i already know that if they find out about him im going to be in a world of trouble for the rest of my life and the topic would be never ending. 

is it possible to anonymously report him and send them all of the info without it being obvious that im involved in the case? im afraid he might be talking to other children and im positive that he has cp in his phone because he sent it to me, the girl in question looked no older than 16 at the very most so id assume shes the same age as me. hes also offered to buy me 🍃 and alcohol. also i forgot to add that he lives in conneticut, im in florida so i assume it will be harder to do what i need to do. can someone help me? is it possible to have someone thats older do it for me? should i just forget about it and hope for the best? any help (&amp; advice obv) is appreciated 🫶 theres also a ton of details i left out so if you have any questions feel free to ask. Also id like to add since its causing confusion that i did NOT send him any cp, all content sent to him were actual “actors” that are well over 18; he sent cp to me 
","nisan ayında bu adam bana instagram'dan mesaj attı, bana bir penis resmi göndererek konuşmaya başladı ve ona olduğumu söylediğimde umursamamış gibi göründü, bu yüzden içgüdüsel olarak onu engelledim, birkaç hafta sonra ben ve arkadaşım, ona john diyeceğim, sıkıldık ve ona twitter'da bulduğumuz bazı videoları göndermeye karar verdik, video resim başına yaklaşık ücret aldık, ona sıkıldığımı söylediğimden emin oldum ve umursamadı, bu yaklaşık bir veya iki hafta sürdü, ta ki ben ve john sıkılana ve günde sadece o kadar para alırken penisini birkaç kez görmeye karar verene kadar. Ortadan ikiye ayrıldık, ayrıca ona satış yapmaya başladığımızda ben ve john ayrı bir hesap açtık, böylece aynı kişi olduğunu bilmiyordu, benden önce mesaj attı ve john onu engellememiz konusunda anlaştılar, ancak sanırım ne hikmetse john onu engellemeyi kaldırdı ve onunla tekrar konuşmaya başladı

şimdiye kadar hızlı ilerleyelim, artık instagram'dan ona pek mesaj atmıyorum çünkü numarası bende var, neredeyse her gün konuşuyoruz ve bunun nedeni benden çıplak fotoğraflar ve gelip onu becermem için yalvarması, ya o bir incel ya da ben onu aşağılamak ve şişmanlıkla utandırmak adresi telefon numarası tam adı yaşadığı eyalet yaşı hepsi var ama onu nasıl şikayet edeceğimi bilmiyorum çünkü ona öldürmekle tehdit etmekten, onu öldürmekle tehdit etmekten veya ona cp göndermekle tehdit etmekten, ki bundan gurur duymuyorum ve boş bir tehditti, üstüne üstlük john ona satış yapmaya devam etmek için diğer hesaplarından birini kullanıyor en büyük engelim onu ​​ailemin öğrenmesini beklemeden şikayet etmek eğer onu öğrenirlerse hayatımın geri kalanında başım büyük belaya girecek ve konu asla bitmeyecek

onu anonim olarak şikayet edip onlara tüm bilgileri, davaya dahil olduğumu belli etmeden göndermek mümkün mü? başka çocuklarla konuşuyor olabilir diye korkuyorum ve telefonunda cp olduğundan eminim çünkü telefonu bana gönderdi söz konusu kız en fazla benden büyük görünüyordu bu yüzden benimle aynı yaşta olduğunu varsayıyorum ayrıca bana ve alkol ısmarlamayı teklif etti ayrıca eklemeyi unuttum connecticut'ta yaşıyor ben florida'dayım bu yüzden varsayıyorum Yapmam gerekeni yapmak daha zor olacak, biri bana yardım edebilir mi? Bunu benim için daha yaşlı birinin yapması mümkün mü? Bunu unutup en iyisini mi ummalıyım? Elbette her türlü yardım ve tavsiye takdir edilir. Ayrıca atladığım bir sürü ayrıntı var, bu yüzden herhangi bir sorunuz varsa sormaktan çekinmeyin. Ayrıca kafa karışıklığına yol açtığı için eklemek istiyorum; ona hiçbir cp göndermedim. Ona gönderilen tüm içerikler çoktan bitmiş gerçek oyunculardı. Bana cp gönderdi."
"I'm 3 years recovered from an eating disorder which took over my entire life. I measured everything I ate and logged it, wouldn't go over 600 calories if I could help it.

I'm finally in a place where I'm happy and my relationship with food has improved a LOT.

Restriction and categorising foods into being bad and good is something I have worked very very hard at unlearning.

But, my mother in law seems to think everything is bad for you, including foods I know ARE good for me. (Lentils, chickpeas, soya milk, tofu, nuts and seeds, etc, all the typical ""health foods"" I enjoy incorporating into my meals. Even certain vegetables I enjoy are apparently bad for me.)

I've invited my in laws to our house many times because I'd love to cook for them, it's something I really enjoy doing. Every time I mention any dish, anything at all, my mother in law says how bad something is.

I went to their house yesterday and helped her to make teas and coffees for everyone, I usually drink oat milk but she didn't have any, so I opted for soy which she had in the cupboard covered in dust (she must have purchased it before deciding it was bad)

I politely commented how my doctor actually recommended I drink more of this, so not to worry that there's no oat! She then lectures me on how it's actually terrible for you and how I should stop.

I tell her that I had bloodwork done recently and how happy I was to discover I'm not deficient in anything, how my doctor was impressed. I was genuinely so pleased about this, as due to my eating disorder history I've always been deficient in something.

All she says in response is ""well they should check your gut health then, that'll tell you everything you need to know""

I've considered the possibility that she may have an eating disorder herself, spoken to my partner about this too and he thinks it could be possible. He doesn't remember a time where she wasn't dieting. She's very thin.

But regardless of that, I don't want to be brought down, to have my progress stunted, because of this.

I've noticed my old thoughts regarding good and bad foods starting to creep back up on me, and I'm terrified.

How do I address this without upsetting her or potentially ruining our relationship?

Thank you.","Yıllarca hayatımı ele geçiren bir yeme bozukluğundan kurtuldum, yediğim her şeyi ölçtüm ve kaydettim, eğer yapabilseydim kalorileri aşmazdım

Sonunda mutlu olduğum bir yerdeyim ve yiyeceklerle olan ilişkim çok gelişti

Kısıtlama ve yiyecekleri kötü ve iyi olarak kategorize etmek, çok çok çalışarak öğrendiğim bir şey

Ama kayınvalidem her şeyin sizin için kötü olduğunu düşünüyor, benim için iyi olduğunu bildiğim yiyecekler dahil mercimek, nohut, soya sütü, tofu, kuruyemiş ve tohumlar vb. Yemeklerime dahil etmeyi sevdiğim tüm tipik sağlıklı yiyecekler, hatta sevdiğim bazı sebzeler bile görünüşe göre benim için kötü

Kayınvalidemleri birçok kez evimize davet ettim çünkü onlar için yemek yapmayı çok seviyorum, her seferinde herhangi bir yemekten bahsettiğimde gerçekten yapmaktan zevk aldığım bir şey, kayınvalidem bir şeyin ne kadar kötü olduğunu söylüyor

Dün evlerine gittim ve herkese çay ve kahve yapmasına yardım ettim, genellikle yulaf sütü içiyorum ama onda yoktu, bu yüzden dolapta tozla kaplı soya sütü seçtim, karar vermeden önce satın almış olmalı kötüydü

Doktorumun aslında daha fazla içmemi önerdiğini ve yulaf olmadığı için endişelenmemem gerektiğini nazikçe yorumladım, sonra bana bunun aslında sizin için ne kadar kötü olduğunu ve bırakmam gerektiğini anlattı

Ona yakın zamanda kan testi yaptırdığımı ve hiçbir eksikliğimin olmadığını keşfettiğim için ne kadar mutlu olduğumu söyledim, Doktorum bundan gerçekten çok memnundu, çünkü yeme bozukluğu geçmişim nedeniyle her zaman bir şeyde eksikliğim vardı

Cevap olarak söylediği tek şey, bağırsak sağlığınızı kontrol etmeleri gerektiğiydi, o zaman bilmeniz gereken her şeyi size söylerdi

Kendisinin de yeme bozukluğu olabileceği olasılığını düşündüm, bu konuda partnerimle de konuştum ve bunun mümkün olabileceğini düşünüyor, diyet yapmadığı bir zamanı hatırlamıyor, çok zayıf

Ama buna rağmen bu yüzden ilerlememin engellenmesini istemiyorum

İyi ve kötü yiyecekler hakkındaki eski düşüncelerimin beni tekrar etkilemeye başladığını fark ettim ve korkuyorum

"I’ve found myself in this awkward situation a couple times &amp; I still don’t know how to handle it. So far, I have heard my roommate having sex a couple times from my room or shared living space while entering our apartment. However, she is not very loud. Obviously, I don’t want to interrupt or invade her privacy, &amp; having a conversation about it feels awkward, as it might come across as me trying to control her sex life. I would also be embarrassed if my roommate confronted me about hearing me having sex.

I understand she has a bf &amp; values her time &amp; intimacy with him. The main issue for me is that  I can’t do chores, eat, or cook while they’re having sex because our rooms are right outside our shared living space &amp; I would feel uncomfortable doing that while they are in the middle of intimacy &amp; could potentially hear me right outside my roommate’s room.

For context, I’m a virgin &amp; the thought of my roommates overhearing me having sex makes me feel paranoid &amp; mortified. Has anyone been in this situation? If so, how did y’all handle it? I’m curious to know how other people have handled it.","Kendimi bu garip durumda birkaç kez buldum ve hala bununla nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmiyorum, dairemize girerken oda arkadaşımın odamdan veya ortak yaşam alanımdan birkaç kez seks yaptığını duydum, ancak çok gürültülü değil, açıkçası mahremiyetini bölmek veya ihlal etmek istemiyorum ve bunun hakkında konuşmak garip hissettiriyor çünkü onun seks hayatını kontrol etmeye çalışıyormuşum gibi görünebilir, ayrıca oda arkadaşım seks yaptığımı duyduğunda bana karşı gelirse utanırım

"Throwaway account because I am not proud of the actions that took me out of my daughter’s life. 

My daughter was born in 2005. In 2006 I was charged with some crimes. Originally got probation and my wife stayed with me. I violated probation and went to prison and my ex filed for divorce before I left county for the prison. But then she didn’t push the divorce. It just sat there. For almost two years. She also cut off contact with me and would not send me letters or allow me to have phone calls. I got zero information about my daughter. 

I figured my wife just didn’t have time or money to finalize the divorce. And while I didn’t have any money, I had time and the ability to file motions in my divorce case for free. I accepted everything my wife asked for. She got our house, cars, what little money we had and full custody (until I got out and then it was supposed to be revisited). I got our divorce finalized about 25 months after she filed it. Then I still had another six years I spent locked up. 

I got out at the end of 2016. I entered therapy and tried to make contact with my ex to try to set up some reunification with my daughter (who was 11 by then. I hadn’t seen her since she was 2). Because my charges were violent (but not domestic) my PO didn’t allow me to see my daughter unless her Mom said it was okay. And I was told that would not happen by my exes Dad. 

I was on parole until February 2019. As soon as I got my termination papers I went to the court house and filed what I thought I needed to in order to see my daughter, or start the process. Found out I did it wrong. That took 6 months to get my incorrect filing dismissed so I could refile the right way. Hired a lawyer and filed parentage time papers. My ex already had a lawyer and the day after my wrong filing was dismissed she filed to have her new husband adopt my daughter. 

Apparently that type of case has to be resolved before mine can be acted on. So I had to file as an intervenor in that case to object. They were using some procedural hurdles to delay delay delay. And then in March 2020 Covid struck and the court system ground to a halt for non criminal matters. 

Remember my daughter was born in 05. So a few months after COVID started she turned 15. It took what seemed like forever to finally get to a hearing with the court. We had to try mediation and that was an absolute waste of money. I wouldn’t budge from wanting to have some contact with my daughter and my ex wouldn’t budge from me completely giving up parental rights. We finally were going to have a hearing in September 2021. She was almost 16. The night before court my exes lawyer reached out and said the adoption was what my daughter wanted. And regardless of any other evidence or argument the court was most likely going to heavily weight her decision and also most likely discriminate against an absent father who had been gone for so long and did I really want to keep fighting and pissing off my daughter. 

That made a lot of sense. So I withdrew my objection to the adoption as long as the court asked her if that was her wish and I still be allowed to send letters and presents even if I got no reply about them. 

That was almost three years ago. My daughter reached out to me over email almost six months ago and while many of her emails are coming from a place of pain I feel like there had also been a lot of healing too and some growth in our relationship. It’s possible she is just using me because I send her money and gifts. But I have a budget I discussed with my current wife that we feel comfortable spending on my oldest daughter and I don’t spend outside that without talking with my wife. 

I found her TikTok account shortly after she emailed me. Her username on TikTok is the same as her Venmo. Several of her videos mentioned being a #csasurvivor. 


I wasn’t sure until today if her stepdad did something, or someone else. Or if she thought I did something before getting locked up. It seems like my ex had not abided by the part of our divorce decree that says we can’t denigrate the other person in the presence of our child. Or allow family to do so either. Anyway, my daughter replied to an email I sent yesterday asking if she’d be ok with me going to her HS graduation this month as long as I didn’t upset her Mom (basically stay away so that her mom doesn’t know I am there). She said that would be fine. And then she told me her stepdad had abused her when she was little. And for a long time she’s been mad at me (rightly so) for not being there to treat her with the love and care a daughter deserves from her Dad. 

I bought access to the web portal in my state where you can look up information on pending cases. And sure enough I found my ex filed for divorce last year in September and the StepDad was arrested last June. He’s out on pretrial release until he goes to trial in September. 

I’m not gonna go vigilante. I have to much to lose by going back to prison, my current wife and younger kids as well as the opportunity to build a relationship with my older daughter. 

And I don’t need therapy advice. I will definitely be talking to at least two therapists about this. I have different therapists that deal with different issues for me working in tandem. 

But I just needed to vent. And scream. And wail. And cry. And tell people I don’t know that my actions set in motion my daughter’s eventual sexual assault. I’m not taking responsibility for his crimes obviously. That bastard can go to prison for as long as they can sentence him. But if I had been the father she needed and deserved, possibly she wouldn’t have been hurt so bad. 

Any advice on how to empathize with my daughter and what kind of support she needs would be much appreciated. 

Tl;dr

My actions indirectly eventually led to my daughter being abused by my ex wife’s new husband. Help!","throwaway account because i am not proud of the actions that took me out of my daughters life

remember my daughter was born in  so a few months after covid started she turned  it took what seemed like forever to finally get to a hearing with the court we had to try mediation and that was an absolute waste of money i wouldnt budge from wanting to have some contact with my daughter and my ex wouldnt budge from me completely giving up parental rights we finally were going to have a hearing in september  she was almost  the night before court my exes lawyer reached out and said the adoption was what my daughter wanted and regardless of any other evidence or argument the court was most likely going to heavily weight her decision and also most likely discriminate against an absent father who had been gone for so long and did i really want to keep fighting and pissing off my daughter 

that made a lot of sense so i withdrew my objection to the adoption as long as the court asked her if that was her wish and i still be allowed to send letters and presents even if i got no reply about them 

that was almost three years ago my daughter reached out to me over email almost six months ago and while many of her emails are coming from a place of pain i feel like there had also been a lot of healing too and some growth in our relationship its possible she is just using me because i send her money and gifts but i have a budget i discussed with my current wife that we feel comfortable spending on my oldest daughter and i dont spend outside that without talking with my wife 

i found her tiktok account shortly after she emailed me her username on tiktok is the same as her venmo several of her videos mentioned being a csasurvivor 


i wasnt sure until today if her stepdad did something or someone else or if she thought i did something before getting locked up it seems like my ex had not abided by the part of our divorce decree that says we cant denigrate the other person in the presence of our child or allow family to do so either anyway my daughter replied to an email i sent yesterday asking if shed be ok with me going to her hs graduation this month as long as i didnt upset her mom basically stay away so that her mom doesnt know i am there she said that would be fine and then she told me her stepdad had abused her when she was little and for a long time shes been mad at me rightly so for not being there to treat her with the love and care a daughter deserves from her dad 

i bought access to the web portal in my state where you can look up information on pending cases and sure enough i found my ex filed for divorce last year in september and the stepdad was arrested last june hes out on pretrial release until he goes to trial in september 

im not gonna go vigilante i have to much to lose by going back to prison my current wife and younger kids as well as the opportunity to build a relationship with my older daughter 

and i dont need therapy advice i will defkesinlikle bu konuda en az iki terapistle görüşeceğim farklı terapistlerim var farklı sorunlarla ilgileniyorlar birlikte çalışıyorlar 

ama sadece içimi dökmem, bağırmam, ağlamam ve tanımadığım insanlara eylemlerimin kızımın sonunda cinsel saldırıya uğramasına neden olduğunu söylemem gerekiyordu suçlarından sorumlu değilim belli ki o piç kurusu onu cezalandırabildikleri sürece hapse girebilir ama eğer ben onun ihtiyaç duyduğu ve hak ettiği baba olsaydım muhtemelen bu kadar incinmezdi

Hi everybody! 

I’m currently 19 weeks pregnant with my first baby and I’m moving to Denmark in about two weeks from the Netherlands. My husband is Danish and I’ve asked him several questions such as what are some Danish customs with regards to birth? Do people drop by to see the baby after the birth or is it more private, is there special food that you typically eat, am I supposed to host something, is it normal for people to see the baby for the first time during the baptism, etc etc etc. However, we are the first in his family/environment to get a baby in a very long time, so he doesn’t have a single clue what the customs are himself. I hope you will be able to help me a little bit so I know what to expect. 


Mange tak!","herkese merhaba

şu anda ilk bebeğime hamileyim ve yaklaşık iki hafta içinde Hollanda'dan Danimarka'ya taşınıyorum. Kocam Danimarkalı ve ona doğumla ilgili Danimarka gelenekleri nelerdir, insanlar doğumdan sonra bebeği görmek için uğruyor mu yoksa daha özel mi? Genellikle yediğiniz özel bir yemek var mı, bir şeye ev sahipliği yapmam gerekiyor mu, insanların vaftiz sırasında bebeği ilk kez görmesi normal mi vb. vb. vb. gibi birkaç soru sordum. Ancak aile ortamında çok uzun zamandır bebek sahibi olan ilk kişiyiz, bu yüzden geleneklerin ne olduğunu kendisi bile bilmiyor. Umarım bana biraz yardımcı olabilirsiniz, böylece ne beklemem gerektiğini bilirim

"My boyfriend of 5 years just told me that it’s not my fault I was born as the weaker sex. He then proceeded to tell me that he 100% believes that women are the weaker sex. I told him this isn’t a conversation to have in front of other people and now my friends think I should break up with him because he should see me as an equal to me not as the weaker sex 😅 I realized I didn’t really ask a question but how would you guys bring it up? It’s so late where we are do I wait till morning or bring it up before he claims he doesn’t remember while it’s essentially still fresh?

Update: we talked it over it was just a misunderstanding because of the point in conversation that he brought it up he meant physically but he brought it up at the wrong point of the conversation which lead me to believe he meant it in relation to what we were talking about. ","Yıllardır birlikte olduğum erkek arkadaşım bana zayıf cinsiyet olarak doğmamın benim suçum olmadığını söyledi ve ardından bana kadınların zayıf cinsiyet olduğuna inandığını söyledi. Ona bunun diğer insanların önünde konuşulacak bir konu olmadığını söyledim ve şimdi arkadaşlarım onunla ayrılmam gerektiğini düşünüyor çünkü beni zayıf cinsiyet olarak değil benimle eşit görmesi gerektiğini düşündüm. Aslında bir soru sormadığımı fark ettim ama sizler bunu nasıl gündeme getireceksiniz? Çok geç, bulunduğumuz yerde sabahı mı beklemeliyim yoksa hatırlamadığını iddia etmeden önce mi gündeme getirmeliyim? Temelde hala tazeyken

Güncelleme, bunu konuştuk, sadece konuşmanın hangi noktasında gündeme getirdiğinden dolayı bir yanlış anlaşılmaydı. Fiziksel olarak gündeme getirmek istemişti ama konuşmanın yanlış noktasında gündeme getirdi ve bu da benim konuştuğumuz konuyla ilgili olarak bunu kastettiğine inanmama yol açtı."
"We live in New Zealand and our parents live in the UK. We’ve told them that we won’t be having overnight house guests for at least a month after our baby is born. The reasons are that we’d like to bond as a new family, establish our own routines, there are quite a few unresolved issues with my mum that makes things difficult for me, and the postnatal period is very difficult and house guests (no matter who it is) will inevitably make it harder.

My husband’s parents have totally understood and will find alternative accommodation when they visit. My parents are being quite difficult, and I’ve had several renditions about how I don’t know how hard it’s going to be and i need their support. They’ve brought up various things that they’ve done for me in the past and insinuated that I owe them. They say that they can’t afford a flight and accommodation, which I totally understand makes things difficult for them. They say they love me and want to be around to help and won’t interfere, but I absolutely will struggle with having them stay with us.

I’m not going to budge on our decision, but I feel sick waiting for their next “move”.
Any advice would be really appreciated.

We absolutely are not going to back down on this, I think I just needed to know that I wasn’t being a complete unreasonable bitch and that other people understand our decision making x x x","Yeni Zelanda'da yaşıyoruz ve ebeveynlerimiz İngiltere'de yaşıyor, onlara bebeğimiz doğduktan sonra en az bir ay boyunca gecelik ev misafiri kabul etmeyeceğimizi söyledik, bunun nedenleri yeni bir aile olarak bağ kurmak, kendi rutinlerimizi oluşturmak, annemle ilgili çözülmemiş birkaç sorun var ve bu benim için işleri zorlaştırıyor ve doğum sonrası dönem çok zor ve ev misafirleri kim olursa olsun kaçınılmaz olarak işleri daha da zorlaştıracak

"NYE was well underway and we three losers were sloppy drunk on the floor when the ""deep"" conversations started. For about 20 minutes the guys were talking about self identity and purpose so I chimed in to say I was thankful to have our friend around. That's when my boyfriend cried out that the friend deserved his midnight kiss too. I thought he was just kidding until my head was forcefully pushed into our friend's head.

Something was off...

My boyfriend started speaking incoherently as he picked us up off the floor and continued to push us together as if we were dolls in the hands of a hyperactive preschooler. When I broke free I frantically asked what my boyfriend was doing. He yelled ""can't you see we are the same!"" That sent him into a nervous fit and he stormed out saying he was having a heart attack. It didn't take long for me to realize he was having a psychotic episode and his delusions kept getting more bizarre. Something about lava lamps and not crying enough for his grandparents deaths. It all came rushing out like a flood.

He kept this up for about an hour before he was back to reality and we could process what happened. He said he was very aware but his body acted on it's own. I don't think he actually had his wits about him because he didn't know about the kiss thing until I told him much later. All signs point to psychosis in my mind, so I'm not really angry. The friend was very forgiving, but I'm still very shaken up.

I don't fully understand what I'm asking for, but I have a feeling I shouldn't keep this to myself. I don't know enough about mental health to know if this is a safe situation or not. It has never happened before but he has become hysterical over presumed infidelity in the past. I never did cheat, but he seems to worry about that sometimes. That's why I was so shocked that he wanted me to kiss his friend! Something is really wrong and I need to find a way keep us all safe.

  
EDIT: thanks to everyone for sharing their recommendations and experiences. It really helps to sort out my racing thoughts over this. I can say many ofour suspicions have crossed my mind. If anything, I feel more validated and better equipped to take the next steps. 

For added context, we're all in our late 20s and have know eachother since high school. This relationship has gone on for 13 years and generally has been peaceful. Recently however, I have noticed my boyfriend deals with more agitation and disillusionment. We've talked for a while about making some changes in lifestyle. He agrees but has not taken initiative to do the ""self-help"" routine. I know we're well past motivational books by now and I am in no position to address this by myself. 

If anyone knows of resources I can contact to find treatment before he gets to the psych hold phase I would really appreciate it!","nye çoktan başlamıştı ve biz üç kaybeden yerde sarhoş bir şekilde yatıyorduk, derin sohbetler başladığında yaklaşık dakikalarca adamlar kimlik ve amaç hakkında konuşuyorlardı, ben de arkadaşımın etrafta olduğu için minnettar olduğumu söylemek için araya girdim, tam o sırada erkek arkadaşım arkadaşının da gece yarısı öpücüğünü hak ettiğini haykırdı, şaka yaptığını düşündüm, ta ki kafam zorla arkadaşımızın kafasına sokulana kadar

bir şeyler tersti

erkek arkadaşım bizi yerden kaldırırken tutarsızca konuşmaya başladı ve sanki hiperaktif bir okul öncesi çocuğunun elindeki bebeklermişiz gibi bizi birbirine itmeye devam etti, kendimi kurtardığımda çılgınca erkek arkadaşımın ne yaptığını sordum, aynı olduğumuzu göremiyor musun diye bağırdı, bu onu sinir krizi geçirdi ve kalp krizi geçirdiğini söyleyerek dışarı fırladı, psikotik bir nöbet geçirdiğini anlamam uzun sürmedi ve sanrıları giderek daha da tuhaflaştı, lav lambaları ve büyükanne ve büyükbabasının ölümü için yeterince ağlamamasıyla ilgili bir şey, her şey bir sel gibi akıp gitti

bunu yaklaşık bir saat boyunca sürdürdü gerçekliğe dönmeden ve ne olduğunu anlayabilmeden önce çok farkında olduğunu söyledi ama vücudu kendi kendine hareket etti sanırım aslında aklı başında değildi çünkü öpücük olayını çok sonra söyleyene kadar bilmiyordu tüm işaretler aklımda psikoza işaret ediyor bu yüzden gerçekten kızgın değilim arkadaş çok affediciydi ama hala çok sarsılmış durumdayım

ne istediğimi tam olarak anlamıyorum ama bunu kendime saklamamam gerektiğini hissediyorum bunun güvenli bir durum olup olmadığını bilmek için ruh sağlığı hakkında yeterince bilgim yok daha önce hiç olmadı ama geçmişte varsayılan sadakatsizlik yüzünden histerik oldu hiç aldatmadım ama bazen bundan endişe ediyor gibi görünüyor bu yüzden arkadaşını öpmemi istemesine çok şaşırdım bir şeyler gerçekten yanlış ve hepimizi güvende tutmanın bir yolunu bulmam gerekiyor

düzenleme önerilerini ve deneyimlerini paylaşan herkese teşekkürler bu konuda yarışan düşüncelerimi düzenlememe gerçekten yardımcı oldu şüphelerimizin çoğunun aklımdan geçtiğini söyleyebilirim bir şey varsa kendimi daha doğrulanmış ve bir sonraki adımları atmaya daha hazır hissediyorum

ek bağlam için hepimiz geç s ve liseden beri birbirimizi tanıyoruz bu ilişki yıllardır devam ediyor ve genel olarak son zamanlarda barışçıl ancak erkek arkadaşımın daha fazla ajitasyon ve hayal kırıklığı yaşadığını fark ettim bir süredir yaşam tarzında bazı değişiklikler yapmak hakkında konuşuyoruz o da kabul ediyor ancak öz yardım rutinini uygulamak için inisiyatif almadı biliyorum ki artık motivasyon kitaplarını çoktan geçtik ve bunu kendi başıma çözecek durumda değilim

"A few weeks ago I got a letter from a debt collector saying that I owe for a electric bill in a state a never lived in. So I called the police, and told them it wasn’t me. Few days later the detective called me and told me, that I had a house in that State, and that the house haven’t paid rent. He said that someone went to court for me and everything. I told him I never did anything like that, I never been there. So a few more days passed, and he called me back, and said he has proof that my mom was using my ID and SSN. I told him was he sure, he said spoke to her, and she said that I did have a house in that state, and that I was just trying to get it removed from my credit by calling the police. I told him I never lived there. He said it was definitely her, and her husband went to court saying he was going for me. He asked if would I Press charges. I told him no, I don’t think she would do that. He said he could press charges himself, because she shouldn’t take advantage of me like this. And that he would call her one more time to talk about it.

I feel so bad about all of this. I didn’t know she would do something like this. I think I will call him back and tell him that I let her use my name. I don’t know if I would get in trouble for saying I let her. I really don’t want anyone to get in trouble, especially my mom. She said I should have just told her to pay it, she said would have, but I didn’t even know she did this. I’m in so much stress about this right now. If she gets charge, how much time would she get? I really wish I never did this.

Update. The Detective said he would press charges.

"My husband (31) and I (32F) have been married for ten years and have been together since high school. We moved in together immediately when we left for college and so moved directly from our parents’ houses into a place of our own. We have a ten month old daughter and she is our first.

I have never considered our house to be dirty, though I knew it wasn’t sparkling clean, I’m not delusional. We do laundry regularly, we wash our bedsheets every 2-3 weeks, our dishes are always done, and we don’t have any clutter. In my mind, I have always looked around our house and thought it was “tidy”. I am realizing suddenly that I am wrong.

My mother was a true hoarder and when my older sister moved back in in her twenties, their home turned into a true hoarder house, like you see on TV. I had moved out right around the same time, but any time I came home to visit, I thought they were disgusting and I swore I would always be cleanly. 

My mother in law is an absolutely clean freak, whose home is more sterile than anything. My husband used to get screamed at if the vacuum lines weren’t right on the carpet or his clothes weren’t folded right. We have always thought we were a happy medium between our families.

Recently I went to a friend’s house and they were finishing up “spring cleaning”. They told me they were exhausted and went through all they had done to spruce the house up. I went home and looked at my house and I am disgusted. I want to cry and throw up.

Our baseboards are hideous. The grout on our tiles is dark brown — we mop, I thought that was enough! The outside of my shower where it meets the floor made me feel ashamed of myself. I started cleaning thinking, well I need to fix this. I cleaned for hours, I was exhausted, and I don’t feel like I even made enough progress to relax.

What do we do? Has anyone else ever come to this realization? How do you fix it? I am not expecting to be perfect (we’re always going to have a couple too many glasses on the nightstand and a small next of socks at the end of the bed — I’m not going to pretend to care about that stuff) but I want my house to be clean. I DO NOT want my daughter to grow up and look back and think her parents were disgusting. 

My husband is on board but I don’t even feel like I know where to begin. I am overwhelmed. We can afford a weekly maid service, but I feel like we need to do something initially before expecting a stranger to help. 

Help us fix ourselves.","kocam ve ben on yıldır evliyiz ve liseden beri birlikteyiz üniversiteye gitmek için evden ayrıldığımızda hemen birlikte taşındık ve böylece doğrudan ebeveynlerimizin evlerinden kendi evimize taşındık on aylık bir kızımız var ve o bizim ilk kızımız

"My (40M) girlfriend (31F) lives with her father and step-mom. The step-mom has been making little snide remarks about how it's weird that a 31year old still lives with her father; that most her age do everything in their power to move out.

What the step-mom doesn't know is that the house used to belong to my GF's grandparents, and left it to GF's mom when they died. When she passed away, the house was left to my GF, who was 19 at the time. There was no reason for her father to move out so they lived there until he got married, and she moved in. I guess no one thought to mention to the step-mom that the house belongs to my GF, and not her father. She loves her house, she grew up there, and her memories of her Mom are tied to that house. She and I are talking about her moving in with me, but in no way shape or form is she entertaining the idea of selling the house.

My GF is chosing to ignore the passive-aggressive remarks to keep the peace. I am trying to stay out of it, out of respect for my GF and her father who is a genuinely nice guy. However, everytime I'm there and the step-mom makes a comment about my GF leaving, I see it as a disrespect towards her and can only contain my annoyance.

I adviced my GF to tell her father to inform her step-mom who actually owns the house. Not to kick her father out, but rather to set the step-mom straight as to who is the guest, and who actually is the owner.

The last time we talked about her moving in with me, I jokingly (but not) told her that she should inform her step-mom that since she (my GF) will no longer be living there, step-mom and father are no longer guests and should start paying rent. Their guest status is revoked and will now be tenants. The house has been fully paid for since her grandparents days; there is no mortgage or outstanding equity loans on the house. Upkeep and taxes are the only thing that needs to be paid for. I suggested that a token rent equal to those costs be paid; to make sure she isn't paying out of pocket for a house she isn't living in, and to make sure the step-mom knows her standing.

How hard should I push this?

***UPDATE: So I showed her this thread, and she now understands that there are lot more at stake than hurt feelings  by letting her step-mom know the truth. She is now pushing her Dad to have ""the talk"" with his wife. She is spending a few nights over at my house to give them the privacy, and as a lead to her moving in. Our hope is that when she comes back to her house (fingers crossed it's just to pick up a few things), step-mom won't be making those comments anymore.***","kız arkadaşım f babası ve üvey annesiyle yaşıyor üvey anne bir yaşındaki çocuğun hala babasıyla yaşamasının ne kadar tuhaf olduğu hakkında küçük alaycı yorumlar yapıyor ki yaşıtlarının çoğu evden taşınmak için ellerinden geleni yapıyor

kız arkadaşım barışı korumak için pasif agresif yorumları görmezden gelmeyi seçiyor ben de kız arkadaşıma ve gerçekten iyi bir insan olan babasına saygımdan dolayı bu işin dışında kalmaya çalışıyorum adam ama her seferinde oradayken ve üvey annem kız arkadaşımın evi terk ettiğine dair bir yorum yaptığında bunu ona karşı bir saygısızlık olarak görüyorum ve sadece sinirimi tutabiliyorum

kız arkadaşıma, evin gerçek sahibi olan üvey annesine babasını kovmasını değil, üvey anneye kimin misafir kimin ev sahibi olduğunu söylemesini söylemesini tavsiye ettim

en son benimle birlikte yaşamaya başlaması hakkında konuştuğumuzda şaka yollu ama ona üvey annesine kız arkadaşım artık orada yaşamayacağı için üvey anne ve babasının artık misafir olmadığını ve kira ödemeye başlamaları gerektiğini söylemesini söyledim misafir statüleri iptal edildi ve artık kiracı olacaklar ev büyükanne ve büyükbabasının günlerinden beri tamamen ödendi evde ipotek veya ödenmemiş sermaye kredisi yok bakım ve vergiler ödenmesi gereken tek şey bu masraflara eşit sembolik bir kira ödenmesini önerdim böylece içinde yaşamadığı bir ev için cebinden para ödemediğinden ve üvey annenin durumunu bildiğinden emin olmak için

ne kadar zorlamalıyım bu

güncelleme bu yüzden ona bu konuyu gösterdim ve artık üvey annesine gerçeği söyleyerek incinmiş duygulardan çok daha fazlasının tehlikede olduğunu anladı, şimdi babasını karısıyla konuşmaya zorluyor, onlara mahremiyet sağlamak için birkaç gece benim evimde kalıyor ve taşınması için bir yol olarak umudumuz, eve döndüğünde sadece birkaç şey almak için olması, umarım üvey annesi artık bu yorumları yapmaz"
"Two months ago, I (36F) began dancing as my long term BF was sent to prison. My daughter, who is 17, picked up on changes and inquired about the shifts in my schedule. Initially, I told her I was working night shifts at an Amazon distribution warehouse. However, she recently discovered my stripper bag in the trunk of my car and confronted me with a text and a photo, simply asking, ""What is this?"" When she returned home, I chose honesty and revealed the truth about me working at a strip club. She seems to be in shock, understandably so, and didn't ask many questions. I'm thinking on how best to approach and discuss this matter with her. What would be the most sensitive and effective way to handle this situation?",İki ay önce uzun süredir birlikte olduğum erkek arkadaşım hapse girdiğinde dans etmeye başladım. Değişikliklerden sonra yakalanan kızım programımdaki vardiyalar hakkında bilgi aldı. İlk başta ona bir Amazon dağıtım deposunda gece vardiyasında çalıştığımı söyledim. Ancak kısa süre önce arabanın bagajında ​​striptizci çantamı buldu ve bana bir mesaj ve bir fotoğrafla bunun ne olduğunu sordu. Eve döndüğünde dürüstlüğü seçtim ve striptiz kulübünde çalıştığımla ilgili gerçeği açıkladı. Anlaşılabilir bir şekilde şokta görünüyordu ve fazla soru sormadı. Bu konuyu onunla nasıl konuşacağımı ve ona nasıl yaklaşacağımı düşünüyorum. Bu durumla başa çıkmanın en hassas ve etkili yolu ne olurdu?
"Hello. I've been really toying with the idea for a long time but I figured an outside opinion was needed before I jump the gun. For context: I have a gemstone name. I don't have a problem with the name in itself, but I do have a problem with the 'stripper' or 'is that your real name?' comments for my entire life. I'm 27 now and am debating if I really want to keep having this conversation for the next 50 years. 

My parents call me by my Spanish name and my friends all call me by a nickname of the spanish name, so it's honestly just my professional life that is affected

Update: Thanks for all the advice! Hearing so many perspectives really helped me out. I'm going hold off on any permanent changes for now, but will be more confident in introducing myself as my preferred name. As some comments said here, I'll try and find my own meaning for my original name so I won't be so worn down by what other people think. 

This was my first post to this sub, and it definitely made a difference to hear some third-parties :)","merhaba, bu fikirle uzun zamandır gerçekten oynuyordum ama acele etmeden önce dışarıdan bir görüşe ihtiyacım olduğunu düşündüm, bir değerli taş adım var, ismin kendisiyle ilgili bir sorunum yok ama striptizciyle ilgili bir sorunum var ya da bu senin gerçek adın mı? Hayatım boyunca yorumlar şu anda ve önümüzdeki yıllarda bu konuşmayı gerçekten yapmak isteyip istemediğimi tartışıyorum

ebeveynlerim bana İspanyolca adımla sesleniyor ve arkadaşlarımın hepsi bana İspanyolca adımın bir takma adıyla sesleniyor, bu yüzden dürüst olmak gerekirse etkilenen sadece profesyonel hayatım

güncelleme, bu kadar çok bakış açısı duymak bana gerçekten yardımcı oldu, şimdilik kalıcı değişiklikler yapmayı erteleyeceğim ama burada bazı yorumların söylediği gibi tercih ettiğim adla kendimi tanıtma konusunda daha özgüvenli olacağım, orijinal adım için kendi anlamımı bulmaya çalışacağım, böylece diğer insanların ne düşündüğü beni bu kadar yıpratmaz

bu, bu alt başlığa ilk gönderimdi ve kesinlikle bazı üçüncü tarafları duymak fark yarattı"
"I hope this post is allowed. I can’t say names or details really but just know he’s a manager of a restaurant, that has two locations in Tacoma, and is locally owned. I was assaulted at his house, he gave me a pill he claimed to be Molly , and I ended up blacking out. I woke up with no clothes , and in a lot of pain, over time im finding out people are not surprised , and that someone has called the store before claiming he assaulted her too. I don’t know what to do, do I go to the owner? I know if I do to record. I’m scared because this all depends on my lively hood. I wonder if the other women who called is on here, I want to hear her story. I feel bad she was silenced. Not to mention the owners are conservative. And I’m confused on if it’s even a good idea to say anything at all. ","Umarım bu paylaşıma izin verilir, isim veya ayrıntı veremiyorum ama sadece şunu bilin ki o, Tacoma'da iki şubesi olan ve yerel bir restoranın müdürü, evinde saldırıya uğradım, bana bir hap verdi, Molly olduğunu iddia etti ve ben bayıldım, üzerimde hiçbir şey olmadan ve çok fazla acıyla uyandım, zamanla insanların şaşırmadığını ve birinin daha önce mağazayı arayıp ona saldırdığını iddia ettiğini öğrendim, ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum, sahibine mi gitmeliyim, kayıt altına alırsam korkuyorum çünkü bu tamamen geçim kaynağıma bağlı, arayan diğer kadının burada olup olmadığını merak ediyorum, hikayesini duymak istiyorum, susturulduğu için kötü hissediyorum, sahiplerinin muhafazakar olmasından bahsetmiyorum bile ve herhangi bir şey söylemenin iyi bir fikir olup olmadığı konusunda kafam karışık"
"My dad(70s) called me up this past Saturday morning and asks if I can talk. Of course, I tell him, what's up?
'The police came and raided my house on Thursday and seized all of the electronics on suspicion of CP, and I'm pretty sure they're going to find what they're looking for.'

He went on to say that he deeply regrets it, and mentioned that he was going to talk to an attorney about next steps. I basically just said thanks for your honestly but I don't really know what else to say in response to that. 

To both myself and my brother, he has admitted to it and has been as remorseful as you'd expect someone that's been caught for something like this would be. One of my biggest issues right now is that I don't know how much of what he says I can actually believe. I asked at one point how long this has been part of his life, he says 'too long', then later he says 4 years. My brother was talking to(yelling at) him about this, and he told him 2-3 years, and then separately told him it had only been since after my mom died a year and a half ago. 

I guess I'm just interested in any other people's experiences that may have gone thru this or similar. 

Edit: It's probably important to note that I have four kids, all 18 and over, and one toddler grandson from our oldest. No reports of anything involving them, thankfully. And for what it's worth, I asked him the day he told me if anything physical had ever happened, and he said, ""No, never."" Don't know how much I can believe that, but there it is. 

Thanks to all that have answered thus far. I will respond to everyone, but it may take a bit, as I have a busy weekend ahead of me. ","babam beni geçen cumartesi sabahı aradı ve konuşabilir miyim diye sordu tabii ki ona ne olduğunu söyledim
polis geldi ve perşembe günü evime baskın düzenledi ve cp şüphesiyle tüm elektronik eşyalara el koydu ve aradıklarını bulacaklarından oldukça eminim

derinden pişman olduğunu ve bir avukatla sonraki adımlar hakkında konuşacağını söyledi temelde sadece dürüstlüğün için teşekkür ettim ama buna cevaben başka ne söyleyeceğimi bilmiyorum

hem kendime hem de kardeşime itiraf etti ve beklendiği gibi pişmanlık duyuyor böyle bir şey yüzünden yakalanan biri şu anki en büyük sorunlarımdan biri söylediklerine ne kadar inanabileceğimi bilmemem bir noktada bunun hayatının ne kadar zamandır bir parçası olduğunu sordum çok uzun zaman önce dedi sonra yıllar dedi kardeşim ona bağırarak bundan bahsetti ve ona yıllar önce söyledi ve sonra ayrıca annem bir buçuk yıl önce öldükten sonra olduğunu söyledi

sanırım sadece herhangi biriyle ilgileniyorum diğer insanların bu veya benzer şeyler yaşamış olabilecek deneyimleri

düzenle muhtemelen dört çocuğum ve en büyüğümüzden bir de yürümeye başlayan torunum olduğunu belirtmek önemlidir, şükürler olsun ki onlarla ilgili hiçbir rapor yok ve değeri ne olursa olsun ona o gün sordum, bana fiziksel bir şey olup olmadığını söyledi ve hayır asla dedi, buna ne kadar inanabilirim bilmiyorum ama işte bu

şimdiye kadar cevap veren herkese teşekkürler, herkese cevap vereceğim ama önümde yoğun bir hafta sonu olduğu için biraz zaman alabilir"
"So, I have a little cousin that I babysit every day against my will, his mom drops him off at my grandma's place (where I live) every afternoon, he's 8 years old and a very... weird kid; he's an ipad kid in every definition of the word, and his mom spoils him rotten with every single gift and toy he wants. 

He's been having some weird conversations, with very heavy sexual undertones, for instance, today he came up to the housekeeper and asked if her husband had cheated on her and how big his pp was, then went on detail on how, had her husband cheated, she should sleep with another guy with an even bigger pp to take revenge. Another time, he was explaining dog mating to my grandma, and how his mom does the same thing with his dad, and how his dad does that with a bunch of ""pretty ladies"".  
Yesterday, he accidentally saw me and my gf kissing (it wasn't a french kiss, just a quick goodbye peck) and now he won't leave us alone, he keeps barging into my room when she's around to ""keep an eye on us so we're not doing naughty stuff"". His mom is completely oblivious to this behavior, and she won't believe anything we say, even after we told her about it, because he's her ""precious little boy"" who ""would never do anything wrong"" and she's ""exhausted from work all the time and can't watch him because it's too much work"". 

  
I have no idea how to approach this kind of situation with his mom, and I don't have anywhere else to talk about this, because I'm a queer woman, and I'm scared of being labeled as a groomer if he starts telling people that he saw me kiss my gf. I'm 100% sure this kid has seen his parents doing stuff and is getting this kind of behavioral issue from home and, if I talk to his mom again, she'll pull the bait and switch and say that I'm the one who isn't caring for her kid properly, so what do I do, how do I make this stop, because he just barges into people's places and drops the most obscene stuff, even after verbal reprehension.

I'm not a parent, I've never had to deal with this type of stuff, and it's making me extremely uncomfortable.","yani her gün isteğim dışında baktığım küçük bir kuzenim var, annesi onu her öğleden sonra yaşadığım büyükannemin evine bırakıyor, yaşında ve çok tuhaf bir çocuk, kelimenin her anlamıyla bir iPad çocuğu ve annesi onu istediği her hediye ve oyuncakla şımartıyor

çok ağır cinsel imalar içeren bazı garip konuşmalar yapıyor, örneğin bugün hizmetçiye geldi ve kocasının onu aldatıp aldatmadığını ve pp'sinin ne kadar büyük olduğunu sordu, sonra kocasının onu nasıl aldattığını ayrıntılı bir şekilde anlattı, intikam almak için daha büyük pp'si olan başka bir adamla yatmalı, bir başka seferinde büyükanneme köpek çiftleşmesini ve annesinin babasıyla aynı şeyi nasıl yaptığını ve babasının bunu bir sürü güzel kadınla nasıl yaptığını anlatıyordu
dün yanlışlıkla beni ve kız arkadaşımı öpüşürken gördü, Fransız öpücüğü değildi, sadece hızlı bir veda öpücüğüydü ve şimdi bizi rahat bırakmıyor, etrafta olduğunda bizi gözetlemek için odama dalmaya devam ediyor, böylece yaramazlık yapmıyoruz, annesi tamamen habersiz bu davranış ve biz ona bundan bahsettikten sonra bile söylediğimiz hiçbir şeye inanmıyor çünkü o onun asla yanlış bir şey yapmayacak değerli küçük oğlu ve o sürekli işten yorgun ve çok fazla iş olduğu için onu izleyemiyor

annesiyle bu tür bir duruma nasıl yaklaşacağımı bilmiyorum ve bunun hakkında konuşabileceğim başka bir yerim yok çünkü ben eşcinsel bir kadınım ve eğer insanlara kız arkadaşımı öptüğümü gördüğünü söylemeye başlarsa bir bakıcı olarak etiketlenmekten korkuyorum eminim bu çocuk anne babasının bir şeyler yaptığını görmüştür ve evden bu tür davranış sorunları yaşamaktadır ve eğer annesiyle tekrar konuşursam yemi çekip değiştirecek ve çocuğuna düzgün bakmayanın ben olduğumu söyleyecek, peki ne yapmalıyım bunu nasıl durdurabilirim çünkü insanların yerlerine dalıp en müstehcen şeyleri sözlü azarlamadan sonra bile söylüyor

My 34 year old daughter has suddenly died the day after Christmas (illness). Viewing planned for Sat Dec. 30th. Her son’s 11th birthday is Wed.Jan 3. How can we recognize his birthday during this horrific time? (Dad not in picture but my daughter had live-in boyfriend) Edited to add: he has an 8 year old sister ,1 yaşındaki kızım noelden sonraki gün aniden öldü. Cumartesi aralık ayında hastalık nedeniyle muayene olması planlanıyordu. Oğlunun doğum günü çarşamba. Bu korkunç zamanda onun doğum gününü nasıl anlayabiliriz? Baba fotoğrafta yok ama kızımın yaşayan erkek arkadaşı vardı. Bir yaşında bir kız kardeşi olduğunu eklemek için düzenlendi.
"So, just a few minutes ago I was on this some sort of sex chat site (I’m embarrassed to admit that but it’s important to the information I’m about to give). Some person posted a photo of this girl and then posted a full name and the state and that she lived in, and basically posted about how they wanted people to rape her. 

I was very fucking taken aback by this, and honestly I felt really concerned, so I looked up the girls name on Facebook. She’s a real person, and she lives in the state that this sick fuck said she lived in. 


I feel like I can’t stand by and not do anything. What do I do about this situation? I’ve heard stories about there being large groups of people who do this type of thing so I want to keep myself anonymous while forwarding this information so I’m not potentially retaliated against. 


I took a screenshot of the OP in question so I have evidence, but what do I do from here?


UPDATE: I did call the police first in her town then in my town. Thank you all for the help and advice, I feel a lot better knowing that the authorities are aware of this situation. ","yani sadece birkaç dakika önce bir tür seks sohbet sitesindeydim bunu itiraf etmekten utanıyorum ama vereceğim bilgi için önemli biri bu kızın bir fotoğrafını paylaştı ve sonra tam adını ve yaşadığı eyaleti yazdı ve temelde insanların ona tecavüz etmesini istediklerinden bahsetti

bu beni çok şaşırttı ve dürüst olmak gerekirse gerçekten endişelendim bu yüzden kızın adını facebook'ta aradım o gerçek bir insan ve bu hasta herifin yaşadığını söylediği eyalette yaşıyor

sanki kenarda durup hiçbir şey yapmadan duramam gibi hissediyorum bu durum hakkında ne yapabilirim bu tür şeyler yapan çok sayıda insan olduğuyla ilgili hikayeler duydum bu yüzden bu bilgiyi iletirken kendimi anonim tutmak istiyorum böylece potansiyel olarak misilleme yapılmaz

söz konusu operasyonun ekran görüntüsünü aldım böylece kanıtım olur ama bundan sonra ne yapacağım

güncelleme önce onun kasabasında sonra da benim kasabamda polisi aradım yardım ve tavsiyeleriniz için hepinize teşekkür ederim yetkililerin bu durumdan haberdar olduğunu bilmek beni çok daha iyi hissettiriyor"
"A friend (m37) of mine (m40) recently sent out an invite to their wedding but I wasn't invited to the ceremony, only the after party and the invitation said to gift them cash for their honeymoon. 

The friend is someone I've known for a few years but we rarely actually speak or meet up. A few weeks ago I got a text to tell them my address so they could send me something in the post. A few days later, before it had even arrived, they told me that it was for their wedding in a month but they hadn't even proposed yet. 

The invite arrived today and inside there was a tick box to which part of the wedding I was invited and it was only to the ""evening after party"". Inside the invite was a small card that said they didn't want gifts from people but would appreciate cash towards their honeymoon spending money. 

I'd have preferred to be invited to the actual ceremony as I'm not really a ""party"" person but I planned that if I was invited to the party only I wouldn't go but would send a card and a small gift, as I'm not the most wealthy person. But now they stated that they don't want gifts, only cash, I'm not sure what to do as I'd only be able to send a small amount which would be quite embarrassing. What should I do in this scenario? I don't have money to send a decent amount but they made it clear they don't want gifts. ","bir arkadaşım yakın zamanda düğünlerine davet gönderdi ama ben törene davet edilmedim sadece after party'ye davet edildim ve davetiyede balayı için nakit hediye etmem gerektiği yazıyordu

arkadaşım birkaç yıldır tanıdığım biri ama nadiren konuşuyoruz veya buluşuyoruz birkaç hafta önce onlara adresimi söylemem için bir mesaj aldım böylece bana postayla bir şey gönderebileceklerdi birkaç gün sonra daha gelmeden bana bir ay sonraki düğünleri için olduğunu söylediler ama henüz evlenme teklifi bile etmemişlerdi

davetiye bugün geldi ve içinde düğünün hangi bölümüne davet edildiğimi belirten bir kutucuk vardı ve sadece akşam after party'ye davet edildim davetiyenin içinde insanlardan hediye istemediklerini ancak balayı harcamaları için nakit para istediklerini belirten küçük bir kart vardı

aslında parti insanı olmadığım için gerçek törene davet edilmeyi tercih ederdim ama sadece partiye davet edilirsem gitmemeyi planlamıştım ama en zengin kişi olmadığım için bir kart ve küçük bir hediye gönderecektim ama şimdi hediye istemediklerini sadece nakit istediklerini söylediler ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum sadece küçük bir miktar gönderebildim ki bu oldukça utanç verici olurdu bu senaryoda ne yapmalıyım makul bir miktar gönderecek param yok ama hediye istemediklerini açıkça belirttiler"
"My brother died on the 28th. I get one last chance to see him before he’s cremated next week. I want to go and say goodbye one last time but I don’t want the last memories of my brother to be of him lying there in the morgue. Has anybody been in this situation before? And if you didn’t go to see your family member did you regret it? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated

Edit: Thanks for the overwhelming amount of responses. It brought me to tears to see how many people are hurting the same as I am, but being able to read everyone else’s stories has brought me a lot of comfort and helped eliminate some of the isolation i’ve been feeling since my brother passed. I’ve decided that it’s best for me to go and say my final goodbye. Don’t forget to love your family while you still can. ","kardeşim 3'te öldü, gelecek hafta yakılmadan önce onu görme şansım oldu, son kez vedalaşmak istiyorum ama kardeşimin son anılarının morgda yatması olmasını istemiyorum daha önce böyle bir durumla karşılaşan oldu mu ve eğer aile üyenizi görmediyseniz pişman oldunuz mu herhangi bir düşünceniz çok takdir edilecektir

düzenleme çok sayıda yanıt için teşekkürler, benimle aynı acıyı çeken kaç kişi olduğunu görmek beni ağlattı ama herkesin hikayelerini okuyabilmek bana çok fazla rahatlık verdi ve kardeşim öldüğünden beri hissettiğim izolasyonun bir kısmını ortadan kaldırmama yardımcı oldu, gidip son vedamı etmemin benim için en iyisi olduğuna karar verdim, hala yapabiliyorken ailenizi sevmeyi unutmayın"
"I am a 35 year old single father with 2 children. My son is 15 and my daughter is turning 10 in December. My dad is 62. 

Before anyone ask, my wife and I are divorced and she has little to no contact with our family.
 TLDR: she was an addict, a cheater, and manipulator and by court order she is not allowed to see me or the children till she undergoes rehab and it's been 7 years and she has not bothered to make any attempt.

Me and my dad have always had a disgusting relationship. My mother unfortunately passed giving birth to me and allegedly my father has not been the same ever since. Not having a mom definitely impacts me and it hurts to know my children lack a mother as well, however growing up with my dad has reinforced my will to not have my children grow up with an abusive parent like I did.

My dad assaulted me, barely fed me, and never treated me with love. I wore clothes other family members gave me after noticing I couldn't fit mine. My teacher even noticed I got came to class with no shoes, because I did not have a single pair that could fit me and that led to a confrontation.

When I got married, my dad did not show, nor did he ever speak to me or inquire where I went when I left home at 16. 

Flashforward when I had my first child it was clear Dad was sick. He's always been sick with something. My wife at the time, before things devolved, really wanted me to try and reconnect with him and after much persuasion I let him meet my son. 

At this point my son had to be like 8. He took a liking to my son and treated him with affection he never gave me. He would buy my son toys, shoes, games, etc. And son obviously took a liking to him. He would also reach out to my daughter, but less so. It was clear that my son was the son he wished he had.

Despite this he was always bitter to me treating me like I did not exist. I'll tell my son he can't have more desert at a family party and he'd say he can. He seemingly went out of his way to spite me. It eventually reached a boiling point when I heard my son say a racial slur that he said he learned from Grandpa. I did not like what he was teaching my son and my son also started to grow hostile and passive aggressive towards me as if my dad has been telling him negative things about me.

In mid October of this year, my Dad found out he had sepsis. He was in the hospital for weeks. They eventually contacted me and one of my uncles expressing he would be best left to hospice care. My dad expressed he wanted to essentially do outpatient care at my home to be with his grandchildren. And this is where we are today

I am staunchly against him coming into my home or around my children. He has been nothing but bitter to me and a bad influence on them. The last conversation I had with him was him saying that ""he is not sad he's gonna die, but he's sad because when he dies his grandchildren won't have a real father."" And that hurt. I sacrifice everything for my children and I frankly don't care about his situation especially if he's going to express those sentiments. 

My relatives have reached out in text, mail, in person visits, and more to talk me into letting him stay saying ""I won't have to put up with him for long"" etc. But I refuse.

Am I doing the right thing here?","ben bir yaşında çocuklu bekar bir babayım oğlum ve kızım aralık ayında doğum yapacak babam 

herkes sormadan önce karım ve ben boşandık ve ailemizle çok az veya hiç teması yok
tldr o bir bağımlı, bir dolandırıcı ve manipülatördü ve mahkeme kararıyla rehabilitasyona girene kadar beni veya çocukları görmesine izin verilmiyor ve yıllar geçti ve hiçbir girişimde bulunmaya zahmet etmedi

ben ve babam her zaman iğrenç bir ilişkiye sahiptik annem ne yazık ki beni doğururken öldü ve iddiaya göre babam o zamandan beri aynı değil bir anneye sahip olmamak beni kesinlikle etkiliyor ve çocuklarımın da bir anneye sahip olmadığını bilmek canımı acıtıyor ancak babamla büyümek çocuklarımın benim gibi tacizci bir ebeveynle büyümemesi yönündeki isteğimi güçlendirdi

babam bana saldırdı beni neredeyse hiç beslemedi ve bana asla sevgi göstermedi diğer aile üyelerinin bana verdiği kıyafetleri giydim benimkilere uymadığımı fark ettikten sonra öğretmenim bile sınıfa ayakkabısız geldiğimi fark etti çünkü bana uyacak tek bir çift ayakkabım yoktu ve bu da bir yüzleşme

evlendiğimde babam gelmedi ve benimle hiç konuşmadı veya evden ayrıldığımda nereye gittiğimi sormadı

ilk çocuğum olduğunda ileriye doğru bir bakış, babamın hasta olduğu açıktı, her zaman bir şeyden hastaydı, işler kötüye gitmeden önce o zamanlar karım gerçekten onunla yeniden bağlantı kurmamı istedi ve çok ikna ettikten sonra onu oğlumla tanıştırdım

bu noktada oğlumun oğlumu sevmesi ve ona bana asla vermediği şefkatle davranması gerekiyordu, oğlum için oyuncaklar, ayakkabılar, oyunlar vb. alırdı ve oğlum da onu sevmeye başladı, kızıma da ulaşırdı ama daha azdı, oğlumun istediği oğul olduğu açıktı

buna rağmen bana karşı her zaman kin beslerdi, sanki yokmuşum gibi davranırdı, oğluma bir aile partisinde daha fazla tatlı yiyemeyeceğini söylerdim ve o da yiyebileceğini söylerdi, görünüşe göre bana inat etmek için elinden geleni yapardı, sonunda oğlumun büyükbabasından öğrendiğini söylediği ırkçı bir hakaret duyduğunda kaynama noktasına geldi, ben de öğrenmedim oğlumun öğrettiği gibi ve oğlum da bana karşı düşmanca ve pasif agresif olmaya başladı, sanki babam ona benim hakkımda olumsuz şeyler söylüyormuş gibi

bu yılın ekim ayının ortalarında babam sepsis olduğunu öğrendi, haftalarca hastanede yattı, sonunda benimle iletişime geçtiler ve amcalarımdan biri, hospice bakımına bırakılmasının en iyisi olacağını söyledi, babam torunlarıyla birlikte olmak için esasen evimde ayakta tedavi görmek istediğini söyledi ve bugün bulunduğumuz yer burası

evime veya çocuklarımın yanına gelmesine kesinlikle karşıyım, bana karşı sadece acımasızdı ve onlar üzerinde kötü bir etkisi oldu, onunla yaptığım son konuşmada, öleceği için üzgün olmadığını ama üzgün olduğunu çünkü öldüğünde torunlarının gerçek bir babaları olmayacağını ve bunun acı verici olduğunu söyledi, çocuklarım için her şeyi feda ediyorum ve açıkçası özellikle bu duyguları ifade edecekse durumunu umursamıyorum

akrabalarım bana mesaj yoluyla, şahsen ziyaretlerde bulunarak ve daha fazlasıyla, uzun süre ona katlanmak zorunda kalmayacağımı söyleyerek beni ikna etmeye çalıştılar ama reddediyorum

burada doğru şeyi mi yapıyorum"
"My (50f) son (25m) is engaged to his fiancée (31f). They have been dating for a year, and I must admit I don’t really support this decision. Frankly, I’m not fond of my son’s fiancée. For starters, my son has a job, but it’s not enough to support a family. Currently, he lives with me and his father (55m). His fiancée, doesn’t have a job and lives with her parents. The plan is that after the wedding, my son will move in with his fiancée in her parents’ house. I met her at her parents’ house, and she was very rude to them, yelling, calling them stupid, and bossing them around, behaving like a 16-year-old.

Her parents seemed really nice, which added to my concerns. When I shared my concerns with my son, he accused me of treating him like a child and insisted he’s an adult who can make his own decisions. While he’s certainly an adult, I was just expressing my concerns. Despite my reservations, my son’s fiancée has diagnosed him with a personality disorder, specifically BPD, despite not being a therapist. We’ve never seen signs of Borderline Personality Disorder in him, but she insists he has it. He hasn’t seen a therapist but continues to tell people he has BPD, which bothers me. When I expressed my concerns about their marriage, he dismissed me as a ‘hater’ and ‘unsupportive’ for no reason which wasn’t my intention. Is my son right? Am I just being a hater and not being supportive? Am I justified in feeling the way I feel? Is this marriage a red flag, or am I just being paranoid? Are my concerns wrong?","f oğlum m nişanlısıyla nişanlı f bir yıldır çıkıyorlar ve itiraf etmeliyim ki bu kararı gerçekten desteklemiyorum açıkçası oğlumun nişanlısından hoşlanmıyorum öncelikle oğlumun bir işi var ama şu anda bir aileyi geçindirmeye yetmiyor benimle ve babası m ile yaşıyor nişanlısının bir işi yok ve ailesiyle yaşıyor plan şu düğünden sonra oğlum nişanlısının ailesinin evine taşınacak onunla ailesinin evinde tanıştım ve onlara çok kaba davrandı onlara aptal diye bağırıp emirler yağdırdı bir yaşında bir çocuk gibi davrandı

"Today he gave me his phone because he wanted to show me a video. But then I saw the search history on his phone.
Kissing? Girlfriend ASMR? Porn surgery? Porn addiction symptoms? Penis... 
It's stupid things that make a 9 year old go crazy for. But I am genuinely worried. He now knows about sex and is actively looking for things related to it. 

Because the same thing happened to me when I was his age and I literally got a porn addiction. By no means do I want him to be like me. I tried turning on restricted mode on YouTube but I really doubt it can filter it out well, and he can just search whatever he wants.

"My husband (23) and I (M22, 23 tomorrow) went out to an outdoor mall with a group of 5 of his friends their age range is 20-24. There were 2 women, and 5 guys including the two of us. Money is not an issue for any of the people in attendance.  
We brought Christmas gifts for everyone there. For the ladies, we brought their Christmas and birthday gifts as we won't be seeing them for a while. Both received a loungefly backpack, one got Billie Eilish's photo album and the other a signed edition of her favorite series. It was clear we put thought and money into their gifts. Both ladies had a gift from the other. They had nothing for us. I don't care that they didn't get me anything for Christmas or my birthday. But I care that my husband didn't receive anything. I may have paid for their gifts, but he chose what to get them and put thought and effort into all of it.   
When I saw that they had gifts for each other and not him, I decided that I was going to buy him anything he wanted. He only wanted two things the whole day, while his friends splurged on themselves (not one of them spent under 200$ before we got food). There was a figure stand set up outside one of the stores, and they had FurryBones. They are little skeleton figures wearing onesies. He fell in love with a starfish and a unicorn. So of course I bought him them. Both ladies commented on how ugly the faces were before I bought it.   
At lunch, they opened the boxes of the things they had bought while waiting for the food to arrive. Various anime figures were on the table, each showing off what they had gotten. My husband pulled out his boxes and was told to ""put that creepy shit away"" by one of the ladies. The other one turned towards me and berated me for being able to pay 45$ for creepy figures. I just rolled my eyes at them. Looking at the website, I was upcharged by 10$ but I don't really care. I thought that would be the end of it, but they were sending me private messages all night about how I am buying my husband creepy shit and telling me that I should be encouraging him to look at cuter figures not dead ones. So I told them that I'd made the decision to buy him anything when they hadn't gotten him a gift. They called me an asshole and left the group chat. They have been refusing to answer my husband and I. I think this is stupid, I can buy whatever I want, but maybe I should have just ordered them online rather than buying them there and then. I don't want my husband to lose friends over this, but he is allowed to like ""creepy things."" Neither of the three guys that were there seem to care and think the ladies are overreacting.

I think there is a deeper issue, but how do I address any of this? ","kocam ve ben yarın bir grup arkadaşıyla açık hava alışveriş merkezine gittik yaş aralıkları kadınlar ve erkekler de dahil olmak üzere ikimiz de oradaydık para hiç sorun değildi katılımcılar için

"I’ll start this by saying, I love my MIL in many ways. She’s kind, generous, and truly would do anything for our family. That’s the reason I feel bad about the stance I am taking on my second birth. 

I’m due on Nov 30th with baby #2 and we have a 20 month old at home. My in laws live 4 hours away and my mom lives in a different country, so my goal is to stagger their visits. All along, I always wanted my mom to be there on day 1 so that she can watch our dog and daughter while me and my husband go to the hospital and then my in-laws would come 2-3 weeks later after my mom is gone. My husband made it very clear that this would cause “detrimental” problems between me and his mom as his mom is dead set on being there on day 1, in fact preferably, in the delivery room or shortly after the baby is born. 

Rewind back to when my daughter was born: my in-laws were at the hospital 4 hours after I gave birth with balloons and a professional camera to take photos. I was so overwhelmed, tired, trying to breastfeed, etc. and I don’t want a repeat of that, which is why I think it’s better for everyone if they just come 2-3 weeks later. 

I also want to add, my mom is flexible, she said she will come whenever I ask her to. I just wish my MIL was the same way, but no, she INSISTS on being there on day 1 and my husband just won’t talk to her because in his words he said “she will hate you for this”. 

I don’t feel comfortable having my in laws at my house for an extended period of time while I am not home - quite frankly I am very picky about how dishes are done, how laundry is done, and how my daughter is fed, and they do everything the opposite of how I’d like it to be done, so it gives me major anxiety thinking about coming home from the hospital to a disorganized home with a second baby. Not to mention, there’s no telling how long they’ll stay and I don’t feel like hosting them then. I want to bond with my baby, not entertain them. 

I’m 29 weeks pregnant today and I’m already losing sleep over this situation - it’s giving me major anxiety. How can I keep the peace and tell my MIL that I don’t want her coming until 2-3 weeks after the baby is born without her “hating” me? Shouldn’t my husband be advocating for me?

kızım doğduğunda geri dönelim, kayınvalidemler doğumdan saatler sonra hastanedeydi, balonlarla ve fotoğraf çekmek için profesyonel bir kamerayla, emzirmeye çalışırken çok bunalmıştım, yorgundum vb. ve bunun tekrarlanmasını istemiyorum, bu yüzden herkes için daha iyi olduğunu düşünüyorum onlar sadece haftalar sonra geliyorlar

ayrıca annemin esnek olduğunu da eklemek istiyorum, ne zaman istersem geleceğini söyledi, keşke kayınvalidem de aynı şekilde olsaydı ama hayır o gün orada olmakta ısrar ediyor ve kocam onunla konuşmuyor çünkü kendi sözleriyle bunun için senden nefret edeceğini söylüyor

"I (M22) went to meet up with a girl whom I thought was really nice. My intentions were purely platonic though. Apparently she thought it was a date. I found out because today she texted me that it was really nice to get know me, but she thinks there is a lot of differences between us. Generally some of her messages make more sense in hindsight, but I am really blind when it comes to these things. Obviously there was some miscommunication on my part.
My question is, should I just gracefully accept my “defeat”, tell her it’s alright and that I wish her all the best?

He went to court but it was dismissed. He’s always loved crime videos, violence etc. But these past 2 years he became insanely violent and my mom just brushes it off because he’s “autistic”. For example he kept saying he will kill us (sometimes he jokes but I can’t tell anymore if he’s serious). He also plays with butterknifes. He watched crime videos on youtube, and he smashes walls and hits. I haven’t told my mom about him joking about killing us, butterknives or crime videos, im scared she will lose her mind.

"My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 5 years now. 

He keeps asking for blowjobs alone despite the fact that I give him head *literally EVERY SINGLE TIME* we have sex, which is fairly regularly. He is threatening to break up with me over the lack of blowjobs by themselves because it’s “been 3 years” (although not exactly; I’ve given him head by itself on a few occasions in that time frame). 

I told him I don’t like giving head in general, that it’s not him, and that I have reasons (various sexual traumas (i.e., statutory rape), a severe jaw bone disorder/pain, and trauma from past issues in our relationship) for not wanting to give him head by itself. He says he *expects* it in a relationship and that no other girl he’s been with has had a problem with doing this for him. He keeps saying a blowjob by itself is different from getting a blowjob before sex. I think a blowjob is a blowjob no matter what happens before or after the fact. 

I feel like he’s being picky. I get having needs, but I don’t understand begging for something that you get regularly, even if it’s not “carried out to completion/start to finish” how he wants. He says he likes getting head from me before sex but I don’t feel like any of it is actually good enough for him because it’s not “how he wants it”.


ETA: while we’re here… what are your thoughts on these other aspects of our relationship?

He thinks it’s okay to look at and interact with thirst traps (especially if he knows the girl personally!), leave disgustingly explicit comments on posts and flirt with women on amateur porn subreddits, and flirt with his female friends without my permission. I have stated on multiple occasions that I am not comfortable with any of this. He says he likes nudity and doesn’t see it as a problem and that he should be able to express himself because he’s “comfortable in his skin”. I find this all to be incredibly disrespectful. 

We have had threesomes at my request because I am bi-curious. When this was first brought up, he decided to arrange a threesome with his female best friend. Fine, whatever. But, that’s not all! I told him before I agreed to anything that I did NOT want to do it with anyone he had a prior sexual or romantic history with, for obvious fucking reasons. I asked him on NUMEROUS occasions over the course of 9 months if he had ever had feelings for or a sexual/romantic history with this girl. *Each time, he said no*. Then, one day, he just randomly admits “I had feelings for her before meeting you and she also gave me head at one point” as if it were nothing. The threesome never happened with her. This particular issue is the main example of trauma in our relationship that I mentioned above. I felt manipulated into agreeing to a threesome that violated my initial boundaries. Its been three years since this happened and it STILL causes issues with me sexually, and affects my self-esteem in the relationship. 


He tells me I need to “get over these things and grow up” (verbatim) 


This is just scratching the surface, but these are two other issues that have been brought up tonight since this discussion about the perceived lack of blowjobs started. 

Thoughts? ","erkek arkadaşım ve ben yaklaşık yıldır birlikteyiz

her seks yaptığımızda ona oral seks yapmama rağmen tek başına oral seks istemeye devam ediyor, ki bu oldukça düzenli bir şekilde oluyor, yıllar geçmesine rağmen oral seks yapmadığım için benimle ayrılmakla tehdit ediyor, o zaman diliminde birkaç kez ona oral seks yaptım

genel olarak oral seks yapmayı sevmediğimi, bunun kendisi olmadığını ve çeşitli cinsel travmalar, örneğin yasal tecavüz, şiddetli çene kemiği bozukluğu, ilişkimizde ona oral seks yapmak istemediği için geçmişte yaşadığımız sorunlar, bunu bir ilişkide beklediğini ve birlikte olduğu hiçbir kızın bunu onun için yapmaktan rahatsız olmadığını söyledi, oral seks yapmanın tek başına seksten önce oral seks yapmaktan farklı olduğunu söylüyor, bence oral seks, öncesinde veya sonrasında ne olursa olsun oral sekstir

seçici olduğunu düşünüyorum, ihtiyaçlarım olduğunu anlıyorum ama düzenli olarak aldığınız bir şey için yalvarmayı anlamıyorum, baştan sona istediği gibi olmasa bile, istediği gibi olmasını sevdiğini söylüyor seks öncesi benden başını kaldır ama bunların hiçbiri onun için yeterince iyi değil çünkü istediği gibi değil

eta buradayken ilişkimizin bu diğer yönleri hakkında ne düşünüyorsun

özellikle kızı şahsen tanıyorsa susuzluk tuzaklarına bakmanın ve onlarla etkileşime girmenin sorun olmadığını düşünüyor gönderilerde iğrenç derecede açık yorumlar bırakmak ve amatör porno alt dizinlerinde kadınlarla flört etmek ve iznim olmadan kadın arkadaşlarıyla flört etmek birçok kez bunlardan hiçbirinden rahatsız olduğumu söyledim çıplaklığı sevdiğini ve bunu bir sorun olarak görmediğini ve kendini rahat hissettiği için ifade edebilmesi gerektiğini söylüyor tüm bunları inanılmaz derecede saygısız buluyorum

benim isteğim üzerine üçlü yaptık çünkü ben biseksüelim bu ilk açıldığında kadın en iyi arkadaşıyla üçlü yapmaya karar verdi tamam neyse ama hepsi bu değil ona söylemeden önce herhangi bir şeyi kabul ettiğimi ve bunu yapmak istemediğimi belli sebeplerden dolayı daha önce cinsel veya romantik bir geçmişi olan biriyle yapmadığımı aylar boyunca birçok kez sordum bu kıza karşı hisleri veya cinsel-romantik bir geçmişi vardı her seferinde hayır dediğinde sonra bir gün rastgele itiraf etti seninle tanışmadan önce ona karşı hislerim olduğunu ve bir noktada bana oral seks yaptığını sanki hiçbir şey olmamış gibi söyledi onunla üçlü hiç olmadı bu özel sorun ilişkimizde yukarıda bahsettiğim travmanın ana örneğidir ilk sınırlarımı ihlal eden bir üçlüye razı olmaya zorlandığımı hissettim bu olaydan bu yana üç yıl geçti ve hala cinsel olarak bende sorunlara yol açıyor ve ilişkideki öz saygımı etkiliyor 

bana bunların üstesinden gelmem ve kelimesi kelimesine büyümem gerektiğini söylüyor 

bu sadece yüzeysel ama bunlar bu gece oral seks eksikliğinin algılanmasıyla ilgili tartışma başladığından beri gündeme gelen iki sorun daha

"Hey,

This is my burner account to get this off my chest (ps: English is not my first langauge)

But ever since I knew about what sex was, I have been thinking about it every single day. Meaning since I turned 10, I have been making scenarios of my head about it. Then I got into watching porn, but I stopped during my teenage years when I got into a fandom, I turned my fantasies into reading and writing NSFW fanfiction. So for the past 13 years of my life, all I think about all the time is sex.

When I grew older, I met few guys, and eventhough I don't share my fantasies or my thoughts with anyone, they were always quick to get dirty with me, but I always ended things before they escalate (I'm still a virgin, the most I've done is a make out session). However, I've had a masturbation addiction 4 years ago, which is now resolved, but I still find myself touching myself every once in a while, and I dont like that at all cause it reminds me of a low point of my life.

I don't feel like this is normal at all, I catch myself the entire day imagining such scenarious, and whenever my friends speak about this topic they speak about it like they have no desire in it- or it's something not important.

So I want to know if there's any way to stop this? Is it normal? Is it not? Should I just accept it? I'm getting really tired of myself so I need help

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT (UPDATE): I have recieved way more comments and messages than I expected so It's going to be hard to reply to every single one, but I did read all of them, and many were a perspective I needed to see.

I decided to talk to my therapist about this, I didn't know if it was something worth bringing up with him because I didnt know if it was normal, but seeing that I have ADHD, and sometimes the thoughts do distract me and lead me to zoning out, I think it's better to speak about it so thanks for suggesting that

Also my family aren't conservative at all, and sex was never a taboo where I live, I'm not sure about why I am the way I am, but again I hope that I will know why and how to deal with it when it becomes distacting.

Thanks for taking the time to comment and reach out!","hey

ama seksin ne olduğunu öğrendiğimden beri her gün bunu düşünüyorum yani döndüğümden beri bununla ilgili kafamda senaryolar üretiyorum sonra porno izlemeye başladım ama ergenlik yıllarımda bir hayran kitlesine girdiğimde bıraktım fantezilerimi nsfw hayran kurguları okumaya ve yazmaya çevirdim bu yüzden hayatımın son yıllarında düşündüğüm tek şey seks oldu

yaşlandığımda birkaç adamla tanıştım ve fantezilerimi veya düşüncelerimi kimseyle paylaşmasam da her zaman benimle hemen kirlendiler ama her zaman işleri kızışmadan bitirdim hala bakireyim en fazla yaptığım şey öpüşme seansıydı ancak yıllar önce mastürbasyon bağımlılığım vardı ve şimdi çözüldü ama hala ara sıra kendime dokunduğumu görüyorum ve bundan hiç hoşlanmıyorum çünkü hayatımın en kötü anını hatırlatıyor

bunun normal olduğunu düşünmüyorum kendimi bütün gün hayal kurarken yakalıyorum böyle senaryolar ve arkadaşlarım bu konu hakkında konuştuklarında sanki hiç arzuları yokmuş gibi veya önemli olmayan bir şeymiş gibi konuşuyorlar

bu yüzden bunu durdurmanın bir yolu olup olmadığını bilmek istiyorum, normal mi değil mi, kabul etmeli miyim kendimden gerçekten yoruldum, bu yüzden yardıma ihtiyacım var

düzenleme güncellemesi beklediğimden çok daha fazla yorum ve mesaj aldım bu yüzden hepsine cevap vermek zor olacak ama hepsini okudum ve çoğu görmem gereken bir bakış açısıydı

terapistim ile konuşmaya karar verdim, bunun onunla konuşmaya değer bir şey olup olmadığını bilmiyordum çünkü normal olup olmadığını bilmiyordum ama dikkat eksikliği ve hiperaktivite bozukluğum olduğunu ve bazen düşüncelerin beni rahatsız ettiğini ve dalıp gitmeme yol açtığını gördüğümde bunun hakkında konuşmanın daha iyi olduğunu düşünüyorum bu yüzden önerdiğin için teşekkürler

ayrıca ailem hiç muhafazakar değil ve yaşadığım yerde seks asla tabu olmadı, neden böyle olduğumdan emin değilim ama yine de nedenini ve uzaklaştırıcı hale geldiğinde bununla nasıl başa çıkacağımı bilmeyi umuyorum

"We Both are 19 y/o. There is this girl (we are classmates and also are in the same college club). She's actually very cute and I was attracted to her since day one, but never had enough courage to speak to her. Today, at about 8 AM. I was cycling outside(it was too foggy in the early morning), when I met her on the way. Now, please don't judge me guys I never had a GF before so I was very nervous but finally asked her out. Now, here's what makes it problematic, she said that she'd date me if I promised to marry her in the future(she seemed very serious about it). The reason is that a few years ago there was a guy she was in a relationship with, who suddenly broke up with her and later she found out that he was cheating on her, and this has left some mental scar on her. I have asked for some time for my answer. Please help me if u guys can.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: Ty ppl for ur advices....As the top upvoted reply suggests I did ask her out(since I actually do like her) but I asked it'll be causual n not marriage, it will be dangerous not only for me but for her too if I was not compatible hope she'll agree to that, otherwise it will be more or less over for us for now she asked for some time to think.Also I swore my loyalty(not that I was gonna cheat anyways)","ikimiz de orada bir kız var, sınıf arkadaşıyız ve aynı üniversite kulübündeyiz, aslında çok tatlı ve ilk günden beri ona ilgi duyuyordum ama bugün sabahın erken saatlerinde dışarıda bisiklete biniyordum, yolda onunla karşılaştığımda hava çok sisliydi, lütfen beni yargılamayın beyler, daha önce hiç kız arkadaşım olmadı, bu yüzden çok gergindim ama sonunda ona çıkma teklif ettim, işte sorunlu olan şey, eğer gelecekte onunla evlenmeye söz verirsem benimle çıkacağını söyledi, bu konuda çok ciddi görünüyordu, bunun nedeni birkaç yıl önce ilişkide olduğu ve aniden onunla ilişkisini bitiren bir adam olması ve daha sonra adamın onu aldattığını öğrenmesi ve bunun onda zihinsel bir yara bırakması, cevabım için biraz zaman istedim, lütfen bana yardım edin, eğer yapabilirseniz

düzenleme tavsiyeleriniz için teşekkürler, çünkü en çok oy alan yanıt, onu dışarı çıkmaya davet ettiğimi gösteriyor, aslında ondan hoşlanıyorum ama sordum, bu evlilik değil, sıradan bir ilişki olacak, sadece benim için değil, onun için de tehlikeli olacak eğer uyumlu olmazsam umarım kabul eder aksi takdirde bizim için az çok bitmiş olur düşünmek için biraz zaman istedi ayrıca sadakat yemini ettim aldatacağımı da söylemiyordum"
"I (female, 16) have a small friend group consisting of a few other girls and one ftm friend that I have known for a decade. He has met my family, but they don’t know about his transition yet, and he doesn’t want me to tell them. He is quite masculine presenting, however, and though I have known him since before the transition, some of the other members of the friend group didn’t. Hence why when he met my other friend’s family (Sarah, female 16), they had assumed he was a cisgender male. 

Here’s where the problem comes in: My friend group was planning on having a Christmas sleepover, and added Sarah to the group (we usually have it with me, him, 2 other friends from elementary school whose families don’t know about his transition, and another friend whose parents don’t really care about her having a mixed gender sleepover). Me and the other girl’s families are fine with having him there, but Sarah’s family expressed discomfort with there being a guy present, and doesn’t want her to come to the sleepover. If we tried to hide the fact that he would be joining, chances are that Sarah’s family will end up finding out and Sarah will no longer be able to hang out with us. Sarah said that we should hang out as an entire friend group, and he can leave before the sleepover portion. However, the rest of the friend group and I really don’t want to exclude him, but we also really don’t want to exclude Sarah as we have already discussed plans with her. What should we do?

PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL OF HIS IDENTITY, I’m not asking for advice to change his identity, I’m asking for advice about a sleepover.","ben bir kadın, birkaç kızdan ve on yıldır tanıdığım bir ftm arkadaşımdan oluşan küçük bir arkadaş grubum var, ailemle tanıştı ama onlar henüz onun geçişini bilmiyorlar ve bana söylememi istemiyor, oldukça erkeksi bir görünüme sahip, ancak ben onu geçişten önce tanıyor olsam da arkadaş grubundaki diğer üyelerden bazıları tanımıyordu, bu yüzden diğer arkadaşlarımın ailesiyle tanıştığında Sarah, onun cisgender bir erkek olduğunu varsaydılar

işte sorun burada başlıyor, arkadaş grubum bir Noel pijama partisi yapmayı planlıyordu ve Sarah'ı da gruba ekledi, genellikle ben, ilkokuldan diğer arkadaşları ve aileleri onun geçişini bilmeyen ve ailesi onun karma cinsiyetten bir pijama partisi yapmasını pek umursamayan başka bir arkadaşıyla birlikteyiz, ben ve diğer kızların aileleri onun orada olmasından memnunuz ama Sarah'nın ailesi bir erkeğin orada olmasından rahatsız olduklarını ve onun pijama partisine gelmesini istemediklerini söyledi, eğer onun katılacağını gizlemeye çalışırsak Sarah'nın ailesinin bunu öğrenmesi ve Sarah'nın artık bizimle takılamayacağı ihtimali yüksek Sarah, bir erkek olarak takılmamız gerektiğini söyledi tüm arkadaş grubu ve pijama partisi kısmından önce ayrılabilir ancak arkadaş grubunun geri kalanı ve ben onu gerçekten dışlamak istemiyoruz ancak Sarah'ı da gerçekten dışlamak istemiyoruz çünkü onunla planları zaten konuştuk ne yapmalıyız

lütfen kimliğine saygı gösterin kimliğini değiştirmesi için tavsiye istemiyorum pijama partisi hakkında tavsiye istiyorum"
"Edit: I never expected this post to turn out the way it did but I'm definitely not complaining 😭 but a lot of people have been asking, so if your wondering as well, yes, it's official!!! What a story we have 🤍

Hey everyone, I'm back with another stupid question but I need help, I just don't know how to go about it, everything I practiced sounds odd. 

So a little background: I met this guy a couple of weeks ago, I asked him out and we've been hanging out and we've been on about 3ish maybe 4 ""dates"" (I'll call them dates but it's just like lunch/a movie) anyways, I like have a really big crush on the guy and I don't know how to tell him I want to be in an official relationship with him without sounding odd. Like I'm 17 almost 18 and he's 16, I can't just say ""hey, wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend"" 😭 like that sounds childish. 

So if you have any experience with this or can help me at all, please do. I really don't know how to go about it. Thank you all in advance!!!!

biraz geçmiş bilgisi, birkaç hafta önce bir adamla tanıştım, onu dışarı çıkmaya davet ettim ve takıldık ve belki buluşmalar hakkında konuştuk, onlara buluşmalar diyeceğim ama bu sadece bir öğle yemeği filmi gibi, her neyse, adama gerçekten aşık oldum ve ona resmi bir ilişkide olmak istediğimi garip görünmeden nasıl söyleyeceğimi bilmiyorum, neredeyse ben ve o, sadece merhaba, erkek arkadaş ve kız arkadaş olmak istiyorum diyemem, bu çocukça geliyor

"I mentioned to the family politely that I thought anybody can park on the street since they do not own the street… not sure what to do since that’s my favorite parking spot, they also mentioned they have “3 cars” and they tell everyone not to park there, i apologize and moved on but Im upset because I think I’m right… anyways I dont want problems with anybody lol",Aileye kibarca herkesin sokağa park edebileceğini düşündüğümü söyledim çünkü sokağın sahibi onlar değil. Ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum çünkü orası benim en sevdiğim park yeri. Ayrıca arabaları olduğunu ve herkese oraya park etmemeleri gerektiğini söylediler. Özür diledim ve geçtim ama sinirliyim çünkü zaten haklı olduğumu düşünüyorum. Kimseyle sorun yaşamak istemiyorum lol
"My parents kicked out of me out of my bedroom and told me to sleep on the sofa, to make space for the new baby to sleep in my bedroom.  Now I don’t have a desk of my own, or a bed or a wardrobe in my room. I’ve got nowhere to call my own space, and it’s really getting me, i have no privacy, the sofa is in the living room so I can’t just go to sleep when I want, I don’t have my own space and it’s driving me insane.

On top of this my parents say I should be grateful because I’m 18 and they don’t force me to pay rent,  but I am hardly even given any space anyways, how could they possibly charge me rent. My clothes are in fucking trash bags in the living room.

"This is my first time using Reddit so I apologize if the formatting is messy!

Some background info, I became a mom at 15 and I wasn't able to tell the father because my parents moved as soon as they found out I was pregnant and I was afraid to contact him and didn't know how I could. So he never knew she even existed until recently when I got hold of his socials and messaged him and told him. Now there is a high probability he will be coming back into our lives. But when my daughter started asking about why other people had daddies and she didn't I just told her that sometimes mommies and daddies don't get along and they have to move away from each other even though that wasn't really the truth. So what do I tell her now? Some people are saying to tell her the truth but she's really too young to really understand that. Some people are saying to just tell her we reconciled but I don't know. I'm getting mixed advice from my friends and family so I was curious what other people would think is a good way of explaining it to her

Thank you in advance for any advice and God bless!","reddit'i ilk kez kullanıyorum bu yüzden biçimlendirme dağınıksa özür dilerim

"My parents (65F and 71M) own a home that's paid off and worth around $600k, but they're currently struggling with credit card debt and a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) totaling about $200k.

"Okay so this guy asked me to make fake nudes of his daughter by using AI because he didn't know how to do anything on the web. (I make fakes of Anime girls using AI). Now he sent me some actual like Instagram images of his daughter, and asked. I told him that it's not possible to make fakes of real people because i didn't want him being a fucking weirdo, but then he precedes to send me a full ass nude of his daughter in the shower that he said was fake because ""She;s extremely religious she doesn't take nudes.. trust me"" . (It was not fake at all, and she looks 22ish). Anyways, with a simple search I found her instagram and now I'm wondering if you were a girl would you want someone to tell you what is going on?

"TW: SA. My (22F) entire life my parents wanted me to be a doctor, and I thought I wanted the same. I’m an only child, my parents are immigrants and both have good jobs. (Moms a psychiatrist dads an engineer who wishes he had pursued medicine) They raised me to believe that a doctor was the only career worth pursuing and the only option I had. Until I went to college and got a bit of freedom from them they actually convinced me that all other jobs were somehow lesser and I actually thought it was my only option. They raised me believing that education and religion were the two most important things and everything else, friends, hobbies, etc. were a complete waste of time. I also grew up muslim (i’m not religious) and my parents were very strict growing up with who I could hang out with, what I could wear, what I could do. They would let me have friends over rarely but only under their supervision so I mostly could only see my friends in school and was often left out of stuff. I wasn’t allowed to participate in after school clubs. I wasn’t allowed to have hobbies outside of academics. I wasn’t even allowed to have a job, and if I did do anything (such as the occasional tutoring I’d do for family friends) they refused to allow me to be paid for it. They told me I didn’t need to worry about a job or money ever because they would provide everything for me, all I had to do was study hard and get into medical school. I was always interested in art/music but any time I would get caught doing it my mom would beat me or punish me by taking away my phone for weeks at a time, so I was never able to pursue the things I enjoyed. When I went to college (parents forced me to go to an all girls private college and paid for everything), I majored in neuroscience because my moon thought it was the perfect premed major and took the courses I needed to get into medical school. I didn’t enjoy it, but I got decent grades with a 3.65 avg gpa the first 3 years. My first year of college was the best year of my life because I finally had some freedom from my parents, but unfortunately had to come back home for 1.5 years due to covid. Even while I was in college they were still very strict though and would come to school randomly to make sure I was there, would constantly facetime me at random times to see what I was doing, and had my location. My senior year of college my life completely changed though. My parents bought a house near my campus where I could finish my last year. This was mainly so I could be in the city which was around a lot of hospitals and they wanted me to get in my clinical/volunteering hours. I stay in one room and they are renting out the other three rooms. It was the most freedom I’d ever had even though they put cameras everywhere around the house to see when I leave and who I bring over. I also had to come home every weekend, but still the freedom I had was amazing. 

Unfortunately soon after I started my senior year I had to deal with a stalker situation that resulted in multiple instances of SA. I won’t go into much detail about the situation. I went to my school about it, and they helped me by giving me leniency on when i turned in assignments but that was about it. I was too scared to involve my parents knowing that if I did they would force me to come home and I’d somehow be even more miserable. I eventually went to the police with the support and encouragement of my bf and that situation has been dealt with. However it resulted in me being diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ptsd and completely flunking my senior year of college. (gpa dropped to a 3.1) My physical health had also gone to shit and I was barely getting 4 hours of sleep a night due to nightmares. I hid all of this from my parents. I lost all my college friends due to not contacting them at all while this was going on. My boyfriend was the only one who knew anything. 
He was really worried about me and said I should tell my parents and that they’d understand and help me. I refused but he didn’t listen and told my mom while the three of us were together one day without telling me beforehand. She completely freaked out and refused to listen, saying we were lying to her and something like that would never happen. She didn’t mention it again. He is a student himself so doesn’t have much money but helped me pay for medication and therapy after this. I’m still working through it but have improved since last year.

During therapy which I did for about three months I also changed a lot. I realized I wasn’t pursuing medicine for the right reasons and now have no interest in pursuing it. My therapist encouraged me to try explaining this to my parents. I knew it wouldn’t go well, but I tried anyways and my mom again completely freaked out and said she would disown me if I did anything other than medicine, so I dropped it. She assumed I had only said that because I was feeling insecure about my ability to do it, and assured me she believed in me and I’d be fine. I also was encouraged to focus on my mental health and do things I enjoy. I’ve been finally pursuing things I’ve always wanted to like singing and learning the guitar. I’ve also been working out and trying to improve my physical health. But this whole time my parents think I’ve been applying to medical schools. They keep asking me if I’ve gotten any interviews, which obviously will never come. I have no idea what’s going to happen when I “don’t get in.” I have no idea what I’m going to do. I have nowhere to  stay and no friends to stay with. I don’t have a job or any money. I don’t know how to tell my parents I lied. I know they are toxic but I have no other family. The only person I have is my boyfriend but he doesn’t have the money to help me. I don’t know what kind of job I would even want to do because all my interests are so unconventional, and there’s nothing in the field I studied that interests me. The thought of being kicked out of this house and having to move back home with them makes me feel so helpless, but I don’t even know if that will be an option because they might just disown me. Even though I’ve improved mentally, I’m still struggling. I know I’m an idiot for not thinking of a plan while I had some small freedom living away from them. It stresses me out so much that I’ve just been putting it off while I dealt with everything else. Now I barely have time before they figure everything out and I don’t know what to do. I feel so lost and scared.","tw sa my f entire life my parents wanted me to be a doctor and i thought i wanted the same im an only child my parents are immigrants and both have good jobs moms a psychiatrist dads an engineer who wishes he had pursued medicine they raised me to believe that a doctor was the only career worth pursuing and the only option i had until i went to college and got a bit of freedom from them they actually convinced me that all other jobs were somehow lesser and i actually thought it was my only option they raised me believing that education and religion were the two most important things and everything else friends hobbies etc were a complete waste of time i also grew up muslim im not religious and my parents were very strict growing up with who i could hang out with what i could wear what i could do they would let me have friends over rarely but only under their supervision so i mostly could only see my friends in school and was often left out of stuff i wasnt allowed to participate in after school clubs i wasnt allowed to have hobbies outside of academics i wasnt even allowed to have a job and if i did do anything such as the occasional tutoring id do for family friends they refused to allow me to be paid for it they told me i didnt need to worry about a job or money ever because they would provide everything for me all i had to do was study hard and get into medical school i was always interested in artmusic but any time i would get caught doing it my mom would beat me or punish me by taking away my phone for weeks at a time so i was never able to pursue the things i enjoyed when i went to college parents forced me to go to an all girls private college and paid for everything i majored in neuroscience because my moon thought it was the perfect premed major and took the courses i needed to get into medical school i didnt enjoy it but i got decent grades with a  avg gpa the first  years my first year of college was the best year of my life because i finally had some freedom from my parents but unfortunately had to come back home for  years due to covid even while i was in college they were still very strict though and would come to school randomly to make sure i was there would constantly facetime me at random times to see what i was doing and had my location my senior year of college my life completely changed though my parents bought a house near my campus where i could finish my last year this was mainly so i could be in the city which was around a lot of hospitals and they wanted me to get in my clinicalvolunteering hours i stay in one room and they are renting out the other three rooms it was the most freedom id ever had even though they put cameras everywhere around the house to see when i leave and who i bring over i also had to come home every weekend but still the freedom i had was amazing

during therapy which i did for about three months i also changed a lot i realized i wasnt pursuing medicine for the right reasons and now have no interest in pursuing it my therapist encouraged me to try explaining this to my parents i knew it wouldnt go well but i tried anyways and my mom again completely freaked out and said she would disown me if i did anything other than medicine so i dropped it she assumed i had only said that because i was feeling insecure about my ability to do it and assured me she believed in me and id be fine i also was encouraged to focus on my mental health and do things i enjoy ive been finally pursuing tşeyler her zaman şarkı söylemekten ve gitar çalmayı öğrenmekten hoşlanmışımdır ayrıca spor yapıyorum ve fiziksel sağlığımı iyileştirmeye çalışıyorum ama bu süre boyunca ailem tıp fakültelerine başvurduğumu düşünüyor bana sürekli mülakatlara çağrılıp çağrılmadığımı soruyorlar ki bu mülakatlar asla gerçekleşmeyecek mülakatlara çağrılmadığımda ne olacağı hakkında hiçbir fikrim yok ne yapacağım hakkında hiçbir fikrim yok kalacak yerim ve kalacak arkadaşım yok bir işim veya param yok aileme yalan söylediğimi nasıl söyleyeceğimi bilmiyorum toksik olduklarını biliyorum ama başka ailem yok sahip olduğum tek kişi erkek arkadaşım ama onun bana yardım edecek parası yok ne tür bir iş yapmak istediğimi bile bilmiyorum çünkü tüm ilgi alanlarım çok alışılmadık ve okuduğum alanda beni ilgilendiren hiçbir şey yok bu evden atılma ve onlarla eve geri dönme düşüncesi beni çok çaresiz hissettiriyor ama bunun bir seçenek olup olmayacağını bile bilmiyorum çünkü zihinsel olarak gelişmeme rağmen beni reddedebilirler hala mücadele ediyorum bir plan yapmadığım için aptal olduğumu biliyorum küçük bir özgürlük onlardan uzakta yaşamak beni o kadar çok strese sokuyor ki her şeyle ilgilenirken bunu erteliyordum şimdi onlar her şeyi anlamadan önce neredeyse hiç zamanım olmuyor ve ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum kendimi çok kaybolmuş ve korkmuş hissediyorum"
"I (29M) have been hanging out a lot with a friend of mine (30F). The last 2 times we ended up kissing. I’ve been avoiding taking things further, but I think it’s inevitable. I like her and she likes me back. The issue is that I feel insecure about having sex with her.

My last 2 experiences (with other girls) were not so great, in the last one I couldn’t even keep an erection. Now, I’m naturally nervous, this girl is very pretty and has a lot of experience so I don’t want to disappoint her. I’ve been considering buying some “long-lasting” condoms, but I’m not sure if they would work. What can I do to feel more relaxed and confident the next time I see her? Did anyone experience this?","bir arkadaşımla çok takılıyorum son öpüşmemizde daha ileri gitmekten kaçınıyordum ama bunun kaçınılmaz olduğunu düşünüyorum ondan hoşlanıyorum ve o da benden hoşlanıyor sorun şu ki onunla seks yapmak konusunda kendimi güvensiz hissediyorum

I’m wondering if i can call the police and have them do something about it because i’m pretty sure thats an invasion of privacy because i get naked and change in my room. I’m pretty sure if i talk to her about it she’s gonna say no so i don’t know if i should break it instead or maybe just cover it up. It’s been there for years but i haven’t really been this upset about it until now. I also know that since i’m 18 now it would be considered child pornography having the camera in my room but maybe there’s something else that would make her remove it. Please help guys it’s just creepy and annoying knowing that i could be watched at any moment.,Polis çağırıp bir şeyler yapmalarını sağlayabilir miyim diye merak ediyorum çünkü bunun mahremiyet ihlali olduğundan oldukça eminim çünkü odamda çıplak dolaşıp üstümü değiştiriyorum ve eğer onunla bu konuda konuşursam bana hayır diyeceğinden oldukça eminim bu yüzden onu kırmalı mıyım yoksa sadece örtmeli miyim bilmiyorum yıllardır orada ama şimdiye kadar bundan bu kadar rahatsız olmamıştım ayrıca şu an odamda kamera olmasının çocuk pornosu olarak kabul edileceğini de biliyorum ama belki de onu kaldırmasını sağlayacak başka bir şey vardır lütfen yardım edin beyler her an izlenebileceğimi bilmek ürkütücü ve sinir bozucu
"So basically, i've been dating my 24 year old girlfriend for over a year now (i'm 23) and i've noticed this issue in our relationship ever since the beginning. For context, I've listened to alternative and rock music ever since I was 14 - It means a lot to me, and in the past i've spent hundreds of dollars traveling to see my favourite bands live, as most are older and don't play as many shows. It's not like mid-western emo, its basically just the popular stuff from popular alternative bands that has stuck with my for neaarly 10 years. My girlfriend literally could not care less about music - she doesn't get the big deal, and only listens to trashy pop songs on those ""hottest hits"" playlists. I wouldn't mind this, but it seems like she's made it her life's goal to make fun of the music I listen to. She tags me in posts of emo people doing cringe things and says, ""omg its you"" and tells everyone around us about my ""horrible taste in music"" and has gone as far as to avoid driving anywhere with me. I assume she takes it as a joke, because there have been at least 6 times where I have gone to her about this and she tells me its not a big deal or that I need to learn to take a joke. I know this seems like i'm taking it too seriously but it feels like she's targetting a specific part of my personality. I guess i've let it go on this long because I thought she might stop soon. What do I do? I'm getting really sick or her being so close-minded and immature about my music taste but other than that our relationship has been great. ","Yani temelde bir yıllık kız arkadaşımla bir yıldan fazla bir süredir çıkıyorum ve ilişkimizde bu sorunu en başından beri fark ettim. Bağlam için 19 yaşından beri alternatif ve rock müzik dinliyorum. Bu benim için çok şey ifade ediyor ve geçmişte en sevdiğim grupları canlı izlemek için yüzlerce dolar harcadım çünkü çoğu yaşlı ve çok fazla konser vermiyor. Orta batı emo'su gibi değil, temelde sadece popüler alternatif grupların popüler şarkıları ve neredeyse yıllardır aklımda. Kız arkadaşım müziği zerre umursamıyor, büyük meseleleri anlamıyor ve sadece en popüler hit çalma listelerindeki çöp pop şarkılarını dinliyor. Bunu umursamam ama hayatının amacını dinlediğim müzikle dalga geçmek olarak belirlemiş gibi görünüyor. Beni emo insanlarının yaptığı cringe şeyler içeren gönderilerde etiketliyor ve ""Aman Tanrım, bu sen misin?"" diyor ve etrafımızdaki herkese müzik zevkimin berbat olduğunu söylüyor ve hatta benimle hiçbir yere gitmekten kaçınıyor. Sanırım bunu bir şaka olarak algılıyor çünkü en azından bu konuda ona gittiğimde ve bunun büyük bir mesele olmadığını söylediği zamanlar oldu. şaka yapmayı öğrenmem gerektiğini biliyorum bunun çok ciddiye aldığım gibi göründüğünü biliyorum ama o benim kişiliğimin belirli bir kısmını hedef alıyor gibi hissediyorum sanırım bu kadar uzun süre devam etmesine izin verdim çünkü yakında duracağını düşündüm ne yapmalıyım gerçekten hastalanıyorum ya da o benim müzik zevkim konusunda çok dar görüşlü ve olgunlaşmamış ama bunun dışında ilişkimiz harika"
"My partner (26M) and I (26F) have been together since sophomore year of college in 2018. We started living together in summer 2023 after I got my second degree to become a nurse. Now I work as a nurse making 100k and my bf is an engineer making 80k. My bf is American but his parents are from another continent and came over to the US in the late 90’s. They’re super traditional and super religious. They didn’t even want us dating at first bc I’m fully American and they wanted him to date “within his culture” but that was very early in the relationship and they love me now. I lived with the parents for a few months while in nursing school and my bf lived at his apartment bc the parents house was close to my college and my bfs place was way too far from it. So we all have a great relationship. They were against us moving in together but knew they couldn’t stop us so accepted it. Now everything is normal. A few months ago I found out I was pregnant. Now I’m 3 months pregnant and my bf hasn’t told his parent (I told mine last week). He said he’ll tell them at the end of June— which doesn’t bother me bc tell them when you’re comfortable just don’t wait til I’m showing you know. When I was driving to my parents house to tell them I told my bf of my plan via phone. I assumed my bf didn’t want to be there bc I told him a week prior the date I planned to tell them and that morning he slept in. My bf blew up on me saying why would I assume he wouldn’t want to be there to do it together (which was my fault) and that he just forgot. So I waited for my bf and he came to my parents house with me to tell them together. They were SO happy. NOW my bf is saying he doesn’t want me to be there when he tells his parents because “he doesn’t know how they will react”. We don’t know how they will react because 1) its out of wedlock, 2) they wanted my bf to be more,I guess, advanced? Idk how to phrase it but they want him to buy a house &amp; get his masters first before kids. Also my bf would be the first in his family to have a kid outside of marriage out of his first cousins (bc he’s the first born). My bf did tell me he told them when he wants to propose to me a few months ago so they know it’s coming. I really want to be there because you know “united front”. But my bf is strong in saying no. Obviously he can’t stop me but I do want to respect his wishes. I want to be there but he’s afraid they may yell or say something that hurts me or say something that makes me want to stay away from them (during the pregnancy &amp; with the baby). Please help. Should I just give my bf the space to tell them himself or continue to be firm about going? Would it be disrespectful if I don’t show my face? I’m just afraid of doing the wrong thing. Plus, we will have to revisit the topic eventually when I go to the parents house anyway. 

*Also plz be nice. My bf is a good guy. We have a great relationship and his family is lovely most of the time lol*","Partnerim m ve ben üniversite ikinci sınıftan beri birlikteyiz ve ben hemşire olmak için ikinci derecemi aldıktan sonra yazın birlikte yaşamaya başladık, şimdi hemşire olarak çalışıyorum ve K yapıyorum ve erkek arkadaşım bir mühendis ve K yapıyorum erkek arkadaşım Amerikalı ama ailesi başka bir kıtadan ve 1990'ların sonlarında ABD'ye geldiler, aşırı geleneksel ve aşırı dindarlar, ilk başta bizim flört etmemizi bile istemediler çünkü ben tamamen Amerikalıyım ve onun kendi kültürü içinde flört etmesini istiyorlardı ama bu ilişkinin çok başlarındaydı ve şimdi beni seviyorlar, hemşirelik okulundayken birkaç ay ailemle yaşadım ve erkek arkadaşım onun apartmanında yaşıyordu çünkü ailemin evi üniversiteme yakındı ve erkek arkadaşımın evi de üniversiteden çok uzaktı, bu yüzden hepimizin harika bir ilişkisi var, birlikte yaşamamıza karşıydılar ama bizi durduramayacaklarını biliyorlardı ve bu yüzden kabullendim, şimdi her şey normal, birkaç ay önce hamile olduğumu öğrendim, şimdi aylık hamileyim ve erkek arkadaşım ailesine söylemedi, geçen hafta kendi aileme söyledim, haziran sonunda söyleyeceğini söyledi, bu beni rahatsız etmiyor çünkü rahat hissettiğinde söyle, sadece bekleme sana gösterene kadar biliyorum, onlara söylemek için ailemin evine giderken erkek arkadaşıma telefonla planımı söyledim, erkek arkadaşımın orada olmak istemediğini varsaydım çünkü onlara söylemeyi planladığım tarihten bir hafta önce ona söyledim ve o sabah uyudu, erkek arkadaşım bana neden orada olmak istemediğini varsayayım ki, bu benim hatamdı ve sadece unuttu, bu yüzden erkek arkadaşımı bekledim ve birlikte onlara söylemek için benimle ailemin evine geldi, çok mutluydular, şimdi erkek arkadaşım ailesine söylediğinde orada olmamı istemediğini söylüyor çünkü nasıl tepki vereceklerini bilmiyor, nasıl tepki vereceklerini bilmiyoruz çünkü evlilik dışı ilişkiydi, erkek arkadaşımın daha ileri düzeyde olmasını istiyorlardı, nasıl ifade edeceğimi bilmiyorum ama çocuklardan önce bir ev satın almasını ve yüksek lisans yapmasını istiyorlar, ayrıca erkek arkadaşım ailesinde evlilik dışı bir çocuk sahibi olacak ilk kişi olacak, ilk doğan olduğu için kuzenlerinden olacak, erkek arkadaşım bana birkaç ay önce evlenme teklif etmek istediğinde söylediğini söyledi, bu yüzden onlar biliyorum ki geliyorum gerçekten orada olmak istiyorum çünkü biliyorsun birleşik cephe ama erkek arkadaşım hayır demede güçlü belli ki beni durduramaz ama ben onun isteklerine saygı duymak istiyorum orada olmak istiyorum ama bağırıp çağıracaklarından veya beni incitecek bir şey söyleyeceklerinden veya hamilelik ve bebekle birlikte onlardan uzak durmak istememe neden olacak bir şey söyleyeceklerinden korkuyor lütfen yardım edin erkek arkadaşıma kendisini anlatması için alan mı vermeliyim yoksa gitme konusunda kararlı olmaya devam mı etmeliyim yüzümü göstermezsem saygısızlık mı olur sadece yanlış bir şey yapmaktan korkuyorum ayrıca zaten anne babanın evine gittiğimde konuyu tekrar ele almamız gerekecek

"So like the title, my sister surprised me with vacation tickets to join her and her kids! She really caught me off guard, but I thought it was such a sweet gesture. She invited me to stay at her place starting December 19th and spend Christmas with her family before we go on our awesome trip after the New Year and I can return home on the 15th of January. 

I did explain to her that as a small business owner, I have some responsibilities and would need to fly in on the 25th. I have to take care of all the financials and inventory before closing my shop, so that's my only available date. It's a bit tough for my partner, who's also working with me in our small business, as they'll have to handle the workload in my absence. But hey, I don't want to miss out on spending time with my sister and her family, so I decided to take my annual leave and enjoy the vacation.

Now, my sister is a single parent with three amazing kids and usually has a live-in nanny to help her out while she works full-time. When I arrived at her house, I noticed the nanny wasn't around. My sister asked if I could lend a hand until the nanny returned on the 27th. I thought, ""Sure, why not?"" But little did I know that it wasn't just a small favor. It turned out I was doing all the household chores, from cooking all thr meals to cleaning everything up.

Fast forward to the 27th, and the nanny still hadn't returned. That's when my sister casually dropped the bomb that she wouldn't be back until after the new year. Whoa, that was unexpected! It finally hit me that she was actually counting on me to keep taking care of the house and her kids. And it was already getting a bit much because she goes out frequently and just leaves me behind to watch the kids while she goes out to have fun with her friends. 

Yesterday she had a friend over and she just assumed I would be covering everything but I actually wanted to go out for New Years Eve so when I asked my sister about dinner (since I had already made breakfast and lunch), she got really angry with me for interrupting her and her friend and snapped at me. I was really taken aback by her tone. 

I felt so overwhelmed that I ended up confiding in our mom about the whole situation. She suggested that I should be helping out and that I should accept it because I’m the youngest sister but honestly, it feels like more than just helping out to me. 
I didn’t end up going out as intended because I was just bummed out and I'm really unsure about what to do now, part of me just wants to fly back home but I don’t want to miss out on the trip. Any thoughts?

UPDATE:
I tried to talk to my sister, she got mad and told me that I should respect her because she sees me as her child so I shouldn’t complain and I should do what she wants. I told her that I’m not her child and we are both adults and respect is earned. Things snowballed, and mom got involved and to no one’s surprise she took my sister’s side.

I talked to my partner and he is organizing my trip back home, sadly I can only leave tomorrow evening and it’s going to put me out of pocket, last minute bookings are soo expensive and it sucks because I had to pay for half my ticket to come visit her in the first place. 
Worst vacation ever! 

She even got the kids to come and ask me why I’m leaving soo soon. I feel bad and told them I would visit them again soon but it made me sad because it’s the last time I will be coming here.","başlıkta da yazdığı gibi kız kardeşim bana tatil biletleriyle sürpriz yaptı ve çocuklarıyla birlikte olmam için beni hazırlıksız yakaladı ama bunun çok tatlı bir hareket olduğunu düşündüm, beni aralık ayında evinde kalmaya ve yeni yıldan sonra harika seyahatimize çıkmadan önce ailesiyle Noel'i geçirmeye davet etti ve ocak ayında eve dönebileceğim

ona küçük bir işletme sahibi olarak bazı sorumluluklarım olduğunu ve 1'de uçmam gerektiğini, dükkanımı kapatmadan önce tüm mali işler ve envanterle ilgilenmem gerektiğini, bu yüzden tek müsait tarihimin bu olduğunu açıkladım, küçük işletmemizde benimle birlikte çalışan ortağım için biraz zor çünkü benim yokluğumda iş yükünü onlar üstlenmek zorunda kalacak ama hey, kız kardeşim ve ailesiyle vakit geçirmekten mahrum kalmak istemiyorum bu yüzden yıllık iznimi alıp tatilin tadını çıkarmaya karar verdim

şimdi kız kardeşim üç harika çocuğu olan bekar bir ebeveyn ve genellikle tam zamanlı çalışırken ona yardım etmesi için evde bir dadı oluyor evine vardığımda dadı ortalıkta yoktu kız kardeşim bana yardım edip edemeyeceğimi sordu dadı th'de döndü, neden olmasın diye düşündüm ama bunun sadece küçük bir iyilik olmadığını bilmiyordum, tüm yemekleri pişirmekten her şeyi temizlemeye kadar tüm ev işlerini ben yapıyordum

hızlıca th'ye ilerledim ve dadı hala dönmemişti, o zaman kız kardeşim yeni yıldan sonra geri dönmeyeceğini söyledi, vay canına, bu beklenmedik bir şeydi, sonunda evin ve çocuklarının bakımını üstlenmem için bana güvendiğini fark ettim ve bu zaten biraz fazla olmaya başlamıştı çünkü sık sık dışarı çıkıyor ve arkadaşlarıyla eğlenmek için dışarı çıkarken beni çocuklara bakmam için geride bırakıyordu

dün bir arkadaşı geldi ve her şeyi benim yapacağımı varsaydı ama aslında yılbaşı gecesi dışarı çıkmak istiyordum, bu yüzden kız kardeşime akşam yemeği hakkında soru sorduğumda, kahvaltı ve öğle yemeğini çoktan hazırladığım için onu ve arkadaşını böldüğüm için bana çok kızdı ve bana çıkıştı, tonundan gerçekten çok etkilendim

kendimi o kadar bunalmış hissettim ki sonunda anneme önerdiği tüm durum hakkında güvendim yardım etmem gerektiğini ve bunu kabul etmem gerektiğini çünkü en küçük kız kardeş olduğumu ama dürüst olmak gerekirse bana yardım etmekten daha fazlası gibi geliyor
sadece hayal kırıklığına uğradığım ve şimdi ne yapacağımı gerçekten bilmediğim için planladığım gibi dışarı çıkamadım, bir parçam sadece eve geri dönmek istiyor ama seyahati kaçırmak istemiyorum herhangi bir düşünce

güncelleme
kız kardeşimle konuşmaya çalıştım, sinirlendi ve bana ona saygı duymam gerektiğini çünkü beni çocuğu olarak gördüğünü, bu yüzden şikayet etmemem gerektiğini ve onun istediğini yapmam gerektiğini söyledi, ona çocuğu olmadığımı ve ikimizin de yetişkin olduğumuzu ve saygının kazanıldığını söyledim, işler çığ gibi büyüdü ve annem dahil oldu ve hiç kimsenin şaşırmayacağı şekilde kız kardeşimin tarafını tuttu

partnerimle konuştum ve eve dönüş seyahatimi organize ediyor, ne yazık ki ancak yarın akşam gidebiliyorum ve bu beni cebimden çıkaracak son dakika rezervasyonları çok pahalı ve berbat çünkü ilk başta onu ziyarete gelmek için biletimin yarısını ödemek zorunda kaldım
hayatımın en kötü tatili

hatta çocukları bile çağırdı ve neden bu kadar erken ayrıldığımı sordu Kendimi kötü hissettim ve onları yakında tekrar ziyaret edeceğimi söyledim ama bu beni üzdü çünkü buraya son gelişim olacaktı"

"My boyfriend (Jake) was married to his ex-wife (Melissa) for 19 years. He has 2 grown children with her. 

In the end, Melissa tried to kill Jake by tampering with his medical devices (I won’t go into more detail for privacy). After multiple hospitalizations he realized Melissa was the cause, and divorced her. He was also granted a restraining order against her that extends to his immediate family (dad, sisters, etc — but not the kids). 

Melissa has broken the restraining order before by trying to contact him directly or indirectly through their children (who live full-time with Jake).

She broke it again when she texted him on Monday. My boyfriend reported it to the police, double-checked the cameras around his house, and just generally seemed really rattled. I don’t think she’s physically violent but again, I don’t know her. I comforted Jake the best I could via phone. I followed up with him yesterday and he seemed to be more relaxed. 

Well today I just texted him to check in again, and he’s at the hospital. He told me “everyone” is there (I’m assuming him + the kids), that Melissa’s health is rapidly deteriorating, she is currently in surgery, and has a 20% survival rate. I knew she had health issues, but I didn’t know the extent of them (because frankly that’s none of my business). 

This woman has been an incredible burden to my boyfriend and his kids, but she is still their mother and his ex-wife of 20 years. As much as he seems to hate her, I can imagine there are SO many mixed feelings happening here. 

How do I appropriately, but genuinely, help my boyfriend navigate this situation? So far I’ve just said I’m so sorry, and that I’m here if he needs me. But I’m sure this situation will get messier — both outcomes are sure to cause a lot of grief, one way or another. 

I’m confused and feel in over my head. Thank you for any advice.

Update: It got better, then it got worse. She was put on life support. The kids are removing her in a few hours. They’re at the hospital now. Fuck. ","erkek arkadaşım jake, eski karısı melissa ile yıllarca evliydi ve onunla birlikte çocukları oldu

bugün ona tekrar durumu bildirmek için mesaj attım ve hastanedeydi bana herkesin orada olduğunu söyledi, sanırım çocuklar melissa'nın sağlığı hızla kötüleşiyor şu anda ameliyatta ve bir hayatta kalma oranı var sağlık sorunları olduğunu biliyordum ama bunların boyutunu bilmiyordum çünkü açıkçası bu beni ilgilendirmez

"I (F21) have an older brother (M28) who molested me through the ages of 4 to 12 and I have never told anybody. It caused me a lot of depression growing up and made me really uncomfortable around men, including my father, who has been nothing but an amazing parent to me throughout my life. It took me a really long time to get over the things he used to do me and I still haven’t fully gotten over it. When I went to college around 4 years ago, I cut him out of my life and would only be civil with him when I would go see my parents (I live in a different state). Lately, both my parents have been constantly bugging me about why I don’t have any relationship with him and why I stopped talking to him and why we don’t get along etc. I was planning to tell them the reason why during thanksgiving break so that they would once and for all let it go but a week ago he found out he has cancer and may not be living for much longer. Of course, this news concerned me and I most definitely hope he gets better but I don’t plan on doing anything to help him or to let things go. I kind of still want to tell my parents what he did to me but I don’t know if I should anymore. He has never apologised to me or even acknowledged what he used to do to me and part of me doesn’t want to tell my parents as they are really good parents and they love their kids very much. But another part of me wants tell them so that they stop asking me what happened. 

Should I tell them or not? Please help.


UPDATE: 

Firstly, I want to say thank you for everyone who has written kind words and shared their opinion on my situation. I haven’t decided what I’m going to do for sure yet but I think I’m leaning towards not telling them. 

I’ve dealt with this for a long time and I think I am strong enough to continue to deal with it alone for the time being. I don’t think it’s worth it to tell my parents, mostly because I know it will completely shatter their hearts, but also because I don’t believe anything good will come out of it. Another reason is that if I do decide to tell them and things go wrong, I’m not ready to stop having a relationship with my parents at this point in time. I’m thinking of confronting my brother but considering his current condition I’m still not sure. My brother has had health problems in the past and this cancer will most likely be fatal as he already has a weak immunity. As much as I hate him, I don’t want to be the cause of his death lol. I’m planning to seek therapy and hopefully get over all of this. I’ll just have to remain civil with him for the time being and keep avoiding my parents’ questions about what happened. Maybe one day I’ll tell them, or someone else. Who knows. 

Again, thank you to everyone who has given advice and to anyone who has experienced the same thing as me, please feel free to message me and we can talk if anyone needs to. :)","Yıllar boyunca bana tacizde bulunan bir ağabeyim var ve bunu hiç kimseye söylemedim. Bu durum büyüme çağımda çok fazla depresyona girmeme neden oldu ve hayatım boyunca bana harika bir ebeveyn olan babam da dahil olmak üzere erkeklerin yanında çok rahatsız hissetmeme neden oldu. Bana yaptığı şeyleri atlatmam gerçekten uzun zaman aldı ve hala tamamen atlatamadım. Yıllar önce üniversiteye gittiğimde onu hayatımdan çıkardım ve sadece ailemi görmeye gittiğimde ona karşı medeni davranıyordum. Son zamanlarda farklı bir eyalette yaşıyorum. Her iki ebeveynim de sürekli olarak onunla neden hiçbir ilişkim olmadığı, neden onunla konuşmayı bıraktığım ve neden anlaşamadığımız gibi konularda beni rahatsız ediyor. Şükran Günü tatilinde onlara nedenini söylemeyi planlıyordum ki bir kez ve herkes için bu konuyu kapatsınlar. Ancak bir hafta önce kanser olduğunu ve çok daha uzun süre yaşayamayacağını öğrendi. Elbette bu haber beni endişelendirdi ve kesinlikle iyileşmesini umuyorum ancak ona yardım etmek veya işleri oluruna bırakmak için bir şey yapmayı planlamıyorum. Hala aileme bana yaptıklarını anlatmak istiyorum ancak artık yapmalı mıyım bilmiyorum. benden asla özür dilemedi veya bana yaptıklarını kabul etmedi ve bir yanım anne babama söylemek istemiyor çünkü onlar gerçekten iyi ebeveynler ve çocuklarını çok seviyorlar ama diğer yanım onlara söylemek istiyor ki bana ne olduğunu sormayı bıraksınlar

onlara söylemeli miyim söylememeli miyim lütfen yardım edin

güncelleme

öncelikle durumum hakkında nazik sözler yazan ve fikirlerini paylaşan herkese teşekkür etmek istiyorum henüz ne yapacağıma kesin olarak karar vermedim ama sanırım onlara söylememeye meyilliyim

uzun zamandır bununla başa çıkmaya çalışıyorum ve şimdilik bununla tek başıma başa çıkmaya yetecek kadar güçlü olduğumu düşünüyorum anne babama söylemeye değmeyeceğini düşünüyorum çoğunlukla kalplerini tamamen kıracağını bildiğim için ama ayrıca bundan iyi bir şey çıkacağına inanmadığım için bir diğer neden de onlara söylemeye karar verirsem ve işler ters giderse şu anda anne babamla ilişkimi kesmeye hazır değilim kardeşimle yüzleşmeyi düşünüyorum ama şu anki durumunu göz önünde bulundurarak hala emin değilim kardeşimin geçmişte sağlık sorunları yaşadığından ve bu kanserden büyük ihtimalle ölümcül olacak çünkü zaten zayıf bir bağışıklığı var ondan ne kadar nefret etsem de ölümüne sebep olmak istemiyorum lol terapiye gitmeyi ve umarım tüm bunların üstesinden gelmeyi planlıyorum şimdilik onunla medeni kalmam ve ailemin olan bitenle ilgili sorularını görmezden gelmem gerekiyor belki bir gün onlara veya bilen birine anlatırım

tekrar tavsiye veren herkese ve benimle aynı şeyi deneyimleyen herkese teşekkür ederim lütfen bana mesaj atmaktan çekinmeyin ve eğer birinin ihtiyacı varsa konuşabiliriz"
"We are both 19. His is 3, including me, and mine is 6, including him. 

He’s been upset about this for a long time. 

In the past, I have called his ex gf a slut during an argument because of the way she dresses (not cool, I know.)

 Well, last night mid argument he told me “You called me ex gf a whore when you’ve had sex with 5 more people than her.”

He claims that at the very beginning of our relationship when he asked me, I said my number was 3. I don’t know if I actually said that or not. But if I did lie, it would have been because I knew how upset he would be over a difference of 3. 

He demanded me for names of the people I slept with, I said no because that’s unhealthy and would do no good for him. He said I know the names of the people he’s slept with so it’s not fair. 

With the insult he gave me I guess both people he’s ever slept with are virgins. So I must automatically be not as pure. 

Don’t know what to do to ease his insecurity.

We are serious and I see myself getting married to him some day. ","ikimiz de onun beni de dahil ettiğini ve benimkinin de onu dahil ettiğini iddia ediyoruz

"I went on a year long backpacking trip and just got home few weeks ago to find my closet pretty much empty. I asked her if she threw them away, she used anger and annoyance to avoid answering my question and continues to deny.  I was so in denial and disbelief that she actually threw my clothes away and continued to ask her a few more time in the next few days hoping maybe she kept them somewhere else and have forgotten. She later admitted she threw away only the ‘very old’ ones. I’ve been holding back my anger to not scream at her but every other day I will randomly remember this favourite top or that favourite shorts of mine and it hurts badly. This is not the first time she has thrown my stuff away, she‘s got this thing where she cleans the entire house by throwing everything that‘s useless to her away and it’s mostly me and my dad‘s stuff. I feel the need to scream at her and make her realise how much it hurts me once and for all but at the same time I don’t really want to as we haven’t spend much time together and I’m already planning to leave again but I need closure to move on and not hate her because I know she loves me. Do I scream or not? Is there a way to move on from this without anger?  


Incase some of you are thinking that it’s just clothes I have to explain that I’ve tried convincing myself that it’s not worth fighting with my mother who loves my dearly over clothes but I can’t help but feel extremely angry every time I remember some favourite pieces as all my clothes are thrifted meaning it took my years to collect them and they’re one of a kind, some I took a lot of effort to alter to fit me perfectly and there’s even a few that I handmade from scratch which took me dayssss from pattern making and all that. We fight a lot ever since I was no longer a child who’s in her control and It only got worse now that I’m a full on adult. I want to stop feeling like a bad daughter who fights with her mom so often, she‘s getting old and I don’t want to one day regret all these fights with her when she’s no longer in this world.","Bir yıl süren sırt çantalı bir geziye çıktım ve birkaç hafta önce eve döndüğümde dolabımın neredeyse boş olduğunu gördüm. Ona eşyaları atıp atmadığını sordum. Soruma cevap vermemek için öfke ve rahatsızlık kullandı ve inkar etmeye devam etti. O kadar inkar ve inanmazlık içindeydim ki aslında kıyafetlerimi atmıştı ve sonraki birkaç gün içinde belki onları başka bir yerde sakladığını ve unuttuğunu umarak birkaç kez daha sormaya devam ettim. Daha sonra sadece çok eski olanları attığını itiraf etti. Ona bağırmamak için öfkemi bastırıyordum ama iki günde bir rastgele bu en sevdiğim üstü veya en sevdiğim şortumu hatırlıyorum ve çok canım yanıyor. Bu onun eşyalarımı attığı ilk sefer değil. Evin her yerini temizleyip işe yaramaz her şeyi atarak temizleme alışkanlığı var ve çoğunlukla benim ve babamın eşyaları oluyor. Ona bağırma ve bunun beni ne kadar incittiğini bir kez ve herkes için fark etmesini sağlama ihtiyacı hissediyorum ama aynı zamanda gerçekten de yapmak istemiyorum çünkü birlikte çok fazla zaman geçirmedik ve şimdiden tekrar ayrılmayı planlıyorum ama devam etmek için bir kapanışa ihtiyacım var ve değil ondan nefret ediyorum çünkü beni sevdiğini biliyorum çığlık atıyor muyum yoksa atlatmıyor muyum öfkelenmeden bundan kurtulmanın bir yolu var mı

bazılarınız bunun sadece kıyafetler olduğunu düşünüyorsa, kendimi kıyafetlerden çok beni seven annemle kavga etmeye değmeyeceğine ikna etmeye çalıştığımı açıklamalıyım ama en sevdiğim parçaları hatırladığımda aşırı derecede öfkelenmekten kendimi alamıyorum çünkü tüm kıyafetlerim ikinci el, yani onları toplamak yıllarımı aldı ve hepsi benzersiz, bazılarını bana mükemmel uyması için değiştirmek için çok çaba sarf ettim ve hatta sıfırdan kendim yaptığım birkaç tane bile var ki bu da beni kalıp çıkarmaktan ve tüm bunlardan çok kavga ettik, artık onun kontrolünde olan bir çocuk olmadığımdan beri ve şimdi tam bir yetişkin olduğumdan beri daha da kötüleşti, annesiyle çok sık kavga eden kötü bir kız gibi hissetmeyi bırakmak istiyorum, yaşlanıyor ve bir gün artık bu dünyada olmadığında onunla yaptığım tüm bu kavgalardan pişman olmak istemiyorum"
"My friend and his girlfriend (we are all in our mid 30’s) came to stay last year for thanksgiving to go to a friends giving at a mutual friends place. His girlfriend was super messy, she came to the house with a bunch of ingredients and decided to cook multiple days for the occasion as we all had to bring a dish. She never cleaned the kitchen after, she would leave her stuff all over the place, like sweaty socks on the kitchen counter. They brought their dog that’s pretty much a puppy and was jumping on the furniture, adding to the mess and stained some furniture.

Last night was kind of the tipping point for me, she just wouldn’t stop crying and I was there for her as much as I could be. I go to college roughly an hour away from where she lives and I don’t have a car yet so it makes the situation difficult. I tried my best last night but every time I gave not the best advice or said something that she didn’t want she’d snap back or make a snarky remark about it, like I’m just trying to help. I eventually got her to fall asleep and I woke up this morning to her calling me and saying the same exact thing and more tears.

She has posted pictures from events that we have gone to together, but doesn’t post any pictures with me in them. She posts a lot of pictures with friends and family.

"I (25f) have a boyfriend (27m) who works for a roofing company. They have planned a Christmas party at the boss’s home in the next 4 weeks. 

A bit of context about his coworkers- he works as a roofing laborer so at work he is at the bottom of the totem pole so to speak. His coworkers are all typical, blue collar, raunchy, “my dick is bigger than yours” kind of men. They spend all day talking about how they have sex with their girlfriends/wives in multiple different ways and places. A hot topic of conversation as of late has been how fat women are comparable to animals (pigs, whales, etc.) and how these “men” wouldn’t even touch a fat woman let alone date or sleep with one. To be clear my boyfriend is not super comfortable with this type of banter and is a rather quiet person in social settings so he doesn’t partake in talk about women and the things that happen in the privacy of our home.

Moving on to me- I am a larger woman, fat some may say. I’ve struggled with my weight my entire life so the topic of my body is a very sore subject. It’s something that in the past three months I’ve really switched my focus to working out daily, eating correctly and focusing on my physical health. Based on the conversations and opinions my bf’s coworkers have about fat women I am really nervous to show up to this party out of fear I will be made fun of or he’ll be ridiculed at work. I’ve considered letting my bf know I’d rather not go but I also don’t want to leave him alone for the night. I’m not sure what to do and I’ve never been put in a position like this before. Should I spare myself the hurt feelings and hangout by myself for the night or do I should up to the party and deal with the repercussions/ force my boyfriend to deal with the repercussions?","eğer bir çatı şirketinde çalışan bir erkek arkadaşım varsa, önümüzdeki haftalarda patronun evinde bir yılbaşı partisi planladılar

While his wife has been away on a business trip, he’s been borrowing money from his teenage son’s college fund without telling him. The son is 17 and really relies on that fund for his future plans. I asked a few friends if I should intervene and they seem to think since it’s technically his money as a parent, it’s not illegal, but the fact that it’s meant for the son’s education makes it morally questionable. I wish he never told me this because now I feel obligated to do something about it but what?

"I’m 20F and I hate when my friends drink or smoke socially. I have gone my whole life without a sip of alcohol or a hit of any drug. If I see my friends or boyfriend drink any amount of alcohol, even just one beer, I immediately get overwhelmed with despair and sometimes start crying. I don’t fully understand why it makes me sad but I have been trying to uncover that in therapy. Alcohol, nicotine and weed are the 3 things that EVERYBODY seems to do, so those are the things that cause the most conflict. As me and my bf (21M) have grown closer I have learned that he enjoys alcohol, nicotine, and weed. I understand that it is not cool to ask someone to fully stop doing those things just for me, so I asked him to not do it around me. I thought that would be enough for me and a decent compromise. A few months pass and I have noticed weed and alcohol paraphernalia in his apartment. This shouldn’t have surprised me, but he did such a good job at hiding it that I was shocked. I immediately started spiraling and have been feeling so shitty since I found out. This shouldn’t be a big deal for a normal person but I feel irrationally sad and horrible that he can’t be like me. I don’t have anyone close to me that is like this and have yet to find evidence that there is anyone out there with the same issue as me. I feel like a freak of nature that doesn’t belong in society. Am I meant to find a partner that has the same values as me or am I the problem that needs to fix this in therapy? Also I would love to know if anyone has heard of something like this so I can feel less insane and maybe talk to someone who relates to me. 

edit: the only experience I have had with people around me abusing substances is my best friend. I have been best friends with her since we were 9 years old. She has struggled a lot with depression and as we aged that evolved into drinking then smoking. To this day she struggles with addiction. She wants to quit weed (she acknowledged that she has a real problem with it) and nicotine. She has been sober from alcohol for about a year now. I have always supported her in her efforts to quit and never shamed her or felt like i needed her to stop for me. We always just agreed that because it’s an issue, she should work towards quitting. As soon as she admits she has a problem and says she wants to quit, my irrational sadness turns into empathy and I just want the best for her.

"So following the advice I got on my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gncnro/i_31f_am_considering_a_divorce_with_my_husband/), I've scheduled for my daughter to see a psychologist. I'm trying to make sure she doesn't think anything is amiss, since if she might've seen something, I don't want her to be worse unnecessarily. The idea that my husband might have had sexual thoughts about her is genuinely horrific, but so many of you were saying I needed to be safe. So... I'm going to make sure she's okay.

I called my husband, and demanded that he tell me whats going on. That i've been so shut out and it's hurting me, and I need to know why he's still in the hospital. That im lost and confused, and need him to be honest with me.

He broke down, and admitted that he hasn't been in the hospital the whole time. That he *was* in the hospital, but now he's with his family. I was crushed. Not only that he's been lying, but that *everyone* has been lying to me. People I've known for years, who I thought I could trust, shielded me from him. 

I lost it. I blew up at him, and told him that if he didn't either fess up and tell me what's been going on exactly, why he left and shut me out, why he's hiding from me, that I'd start looking for a divorce attorney. I expected him to panic. I wanted him to panic, to beg me not to. But he was just... calm. He said he didn't want a divorce, but that ""I had to do what I thought was right"", and he just didn't try and stop me. I don't know. My daughter's appointment with the psychologist is next week, and until then, I'm not going to be talking to anyone in that family. Not until he talks to me. But I don't know if he will. Is there some way I can get him to explain? Or should I just see how things go with the psychologist, and take things from there?

Thank you for all the kind words in my previous post. This has been just the worst period of my life I've ever experienced, and your words have meant a lot. I think I'm going to spend the time between now and the appointment making sure my daughter is okay and loved. ","son gönderimde aldığım tavsiyeye uyarak httpswwwredditcomradvicecommentsgncnroifamconsideringadivorcewithmyhusband kızımın bir psikologla görüşmesini ayarladım, bir şeylerin ters gittiğini düşünmediğinden emin olmaya çalışıyorum çünkü bir şey görmüş olabilirse gereksiz yere daha kötü olmasını istemiyorum kocamın onun hakkında cinsel düşüncelere sahip olma fikri gerçekten korkunç ama birçoğunuz güvende olmam gerektiğini söylüyordunuz bu yüzden onun iyi olduğundan emin olacağım

kocamı aradım ve bana neler olduğunu söylemesini istedim, bu kadar dışlanmıştım ve bu beni incitiyor ve neden hala hastanede olduğunu bilmem gerekiyor, kayboldum ve kafam karıştı ve bana karşı dürüst olması gerekiyor

çöktü ve hastanede olduğu süre boyunca hastanede olmadığını itiraf etti ama şimdi ailesiyle birlikte sadece yalan söylemesi değil, herkesin bana yalan söylemesi de beni mahvetti, yıllardır tanıdığım ve güvenebileceğimi düşündüğüm insanlar beni ondan korudu

kendimi kaybettim ona patladım ve eğer itiraf etmez ve bana tam olarak ne olduğunu anlatmazsa neden ayrıldığını ve beni neden benden sakladığını boşanma avukatı aramaya başlayacağımı söyledim paniklemesini bekliyordum paniklemesini ve bana yapmamam için yalvarmasını istiyordum ama sakindi boşanmak istemediğini ama doğru olduğunu düşündüğüm şeyi yapmam gerektiğini söyledi ve beni durdurmaya çalışmadı bilmiyorum kızımın psikologla randevusu gelecek hafta ve o zamana kadar o aileden kimseyle konuşmayacağım benimle konuşana kadar ama konuşup konuşmayacağını bilmiyorum ona açıklamasını söyleyebileceğim bir yol var mı yoksa psikologla işlerin nasıl gittiğini görüp oradan mı devam etmeliyim

önceki yazımda söylediğiniz tüm güzel sözler için teşekkür ederim bu hayatımın yaşadığım en kötü dönemiydi ve sözleriniz çok şey ifade etti sanırım randevuya kadar olan zamanı kızımın iyi olduğundan ve sevildiğinden emin olmak için harcayacağım"
"
I am a 25 year old female and have been together with my boyfriend (24 year old male) since we were 16. We have been together almost 9 years. For a little background info, we don’t have our own place together (can’t afford a house post-grad) and but basically live together at his parents house. We aren’t engaged yet, I do know that he does have a ring bought already. * I know being together 8 years and not being engaged sounds bad but that includes 2 years of high school and 4 years of long distance through college* 

Anyway, our relationship has been as close to perfect as you can get. Very much in love, no huge fights or issues, we just generally work so well together and are each other’s rocks. The only real issue we had was back in high school, just around our 1 year anniversary. We were both 17 and he went to a party and I didn’t go, a couple days later I heard rumors that he had kissed another girl. At the time he said he blacked out and had no memory of this happening (being 17, I had never been drunk before and legitimately thought blacking out meant a wiped memory). He thinks he remembered this girl sitting on his lap but other than that “he had no idea.” This was our only huge fight where we “broke up” for like 3 days. I remember at the time thinking it was so weird that he wasn’t denying it, but he seemed genuine when he said he had absolutely no memory and was very sorry and we ended up getting past it. Throughout the years I would joke around about the girl, but very rarely (maybe a snide comment here or there). 

Flash forward to today, he sits me down, very nervously and told me that he bought the ring and wishes he had this conversation beforehand but wants to be completely open and honest before we take this next step in our lives. He tells me a few moments in his life where he had deep, shameful regrets (some of them being stories from when he was 6 or 7 and stole money from his sister, etc.) and then he tells me that the night of that party in 2017, over 7 years ago, that he did “blackout” that night but he made out with this girl and slept in the same bed. He’s so sorry and he never touched another girl after that etc… 

I feel like my whole world stopped. I have so many feelings… I am so hurt and sad that he did that, so angry that he lied for so long? I have no idea what I feel. Am I crazy to feel cheated on? On one hand, we were 17, this was (probably) his first time getting that drunk, at least it wasn’t sex? On the other hand, I remember feeling so in love at that time (still in that same honeymoon-puppy love today, I would have never done that even when I was 17?), we had been together for a year at the time of it happening, he lied for 7 years about it, always sticking to his guns about having no memory of it. I think that’s why I am the most distraught- this man that I completely love and trust with every cell of my being held this from me.

He genuinely seemed very upset telling me this information today, saying he was so terrified of losing me he decided to not tell me originally. Then I think we kinda forgot about it and haven’t really talked about that situation in maybe 5 or 6 years? 

What would you do? Was I cheated on? Can I trust that he only made out with her /slept in the same bed? (We were already having sex at that point and he is VERY horny, I can’t imagine a drunk version of him stopping at just making out…) what is worse-that he cheated or that he lied about it for 7 years? 

Please if anyone has any thoughts, kind or mean, I don’t care. All questions/comments welcome. ","ben bir yaşında bir kadınım ve erkek arkadaşımla bir yaşında bir erkeğim, birlikte olduğumuz yıl sayısı 10'dur, birlikteyiz, biraz geçmiş bilgisi, kendi evimiz yok, birlikte bir evimiz yok, mezun olduktan sonra ev alamıyoruz ama temelde onun ailesinin evinde yaşıyoruz, henüz nişanlı değiliz, yüzüğünün olduğunu biliyorum, birlikte olmak ve nişanlanmamak kulağa kötü geliyor ama buna lise yılları ve üniversite yılları da dahil

neyse, ilişkimiz olabilecek en mükemmel ilişkiydi, çok aşık olduk, büyük kavgalar veya sorunlar olmadı, sadece genel olarak çok iyi anlaşıyoruz ve birbirimizin kayalarıyız, yaşadığımız tek gerçek sorun lisedeyken, yıl dönümümüz civarındaydı, ikimiz de gittik ve o bir partiye gitti ve ben gitmedim, birkaç gün sonra başka bir kızı öptüğüne dair söylentiler duydum, o sırada bayıldığını ve bunun olduğunu hatırlamadığını söyledi, çünkü daha önce hiç sarhoş olmamıştım ve bayılmanın hafızanın silinmesi anlamına geldiğini düşünüyordu, kucağında oturan bu kızı hatırladığını düşünüyor ama bunun dışında hiçbir fikri yoktu, ayrıldığımız tek büyük kavgamızdı günlerce o zamanlar bunu inkar etmemesinin çok garip olduğunu düşündüğümü hatırlıyorum ama kesinlikle hiçbir şey hatırlamadığını ve çok üzgün olduğunu söylediğinde samimi görünüyordu ve yıllar içinde bunu atlattık kız hakkında şakalaşırdım ama çok nadiren belki burada veya orada alaycı bir yorum

bugüne hızlıca ilerleyelim, beni çok gergin bir şekilde oturttu ve bana yüzüğü satın aldığını ve bu konuşmayı önceden yapmayı dilediğini ama hayatımızdaki bu bir sonraki adımı atmadan önce tamamen açık ve dürüst olmak istediğini söyledi bana hayatında derin utanç verici pişmanlıkları olduğu birkaç anı anlattı bunlardan bazıları kız kardeşinden para çaldığı zamanlara ait hikayelerdi vs. ve sonra bana yıllar önce o parti gecesi bayıldığını ama bu kızla öpüştüğünü ve aynı yatakta yattığını çok üzgün olduğunu ve ondan sonra başka bir kıza dokunmadığını vs. söyledi

sanki bütün dünyam durdu çok fazla duygum var çok incindim ve üzgünüm bunu yaptığı için çok uzun süre yalan söylediği için çok öfkeliyim ne hissettiğimi bilmiyorum deli miyim aldatılmış hissetmek bir yandan bizdik bu muhtemelen onun ilk kez bu kadar sarhoş olmasıydı en azından seks değildi diğer yandan o zamanlar çok aşık olduğumu hatırlıyorum hala aynı balayındayız köpek aşkı bugün bunu asla yapmazdım o zamanlar bile bir yıldır birlikteydik o zamanlar bu olay olduğunda o yıllarca yalan söyledi her zaman hiçbir şey hatırlamadığını söyledi sanırım bu yüzden en çok perişan olan benim tamamen sevdiğim ve güvendiğim bu adam bunu benden sakladı

bugün bana bu bilgiyi gerçekten çok üzgün görünüyordu beni kaybetmekten çok korktuğunu söyledi bana başta söylememeye karar verdi sonra sanırım bunu unuttuk ve belki de yıllardır bu durum hakkında gerçekten konuşmadık

aldatırsam ne yapardın sadece onunla öpüştüğüne güvenebilir miydim aynı yatakta uyuduk o noktada zaten seks yapıyorduk ve çok azgın sarhoş bir versiyonunun sadece öpüşmekle yetindiğini hayal edemiyorum daha kötüsü aldatmış olması mı yoksa yıllarca yalan söylemiş olması mı

lütfen herhangi bir fikri olan varsa nazik veya kötü niyetli, umursamıyorum tüm sorulara yorumlara açığım"
"I need some advice. My husband, 35 M, and I, 28 F, have been married for 3 years. 3 weeks after we got married, he had a one night stand with a coworker (who doesn’t work with him anymore). He just told me about the cheating a month ago and I’m shattered. I’m trying to keep myself together for my kids (not his biological children) and for myself because I want to get my career together and finish school. I am losing grip on it all and I have no idea what to do. He sends me texts about how much he regrets it and loves me but I just don’t feel it anymore. I’m broken. I have no wear to go and no money. But I am aching to the point I can’t look at him…. Any good advice on what I should do?

"For a little context, I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year and three months. He’s kind, treats me well, and always goes out of his way for me. My only real issue is that he’s somewhat of a mama’s boy. Don’t get me wrong; I have a good relationship with his mom, and she loves me and approves of our relationship. Initially, his closeness with her didn’t bother me, and I thought it was sweet how much he cared for her. However, when the topic of kids came up, I was uncomfortable with what he said.

A couple of months ago, we discussed the delivery room situation. No, I’m not currently pregnant, but we were talking about what we’d do when that time comes in the future. He mentioned that he has always wanted his mother to be in the delivery room with his girlfriend or wife, while I expressed that I would prefer him to be there with me. He said he’s squeamish and can’t handle the sight of blood, fearing he would freak out. I pointed out that during my mom’s deliveries, a sheet was used to cover everything, so my dad only saw her face and part of her stomach. Despite that, he continued to come up with every excuse in the book.

I won’t lie, I was hurt by this. I always imagined my partner being in the delivery room with me, holding my hand and comforting me. Afterwards I said if he really didn’t want to be there that bad then my mom would be the next best option to which he also disagreed. He claimed his mom would be able to help me better, since she’s had 6 kids and apparently helped a lot of women give birth. I told him I wasn’t comfortable with his mother seeing my privates or seeing me in a vulnerable situation like that but he claims it’s normal in his culture for the women to help eachother give birth. (he’s Mexican, I’m half white, half Mexican but basically just white lol.) 

He actually said I’m just insecure about my body, which is why I’m uncomfortable with her seeing me practically naked. However, that’s not the only issue. Another concern is that it would offend my mom if I had the option to choose one person to be in the delivery room and chose his mother instead. He insisted that he has always wanted it this way, as if my feelings don’t matter. Since I’m the one giving birth and going through something traumatic, I believe I should have someone there who has supported me my entire life.

Despite all this, I stood my ground and told him, “If you don’t want to be in there with me, my mom will be in the room, end of story.” This upset him a lot.

I understand how he feels, and of course, his mother is welcome to be there and come in the room after I’ve given birth. I just feel like I need someone there that I’m comfortable with. I was willing to compromise on him not being in the room, but I can’t compromise on this. I know his mom may have given birth more times than my mom, but it’s not about that. The nurses and doctors will help me deliver; I just need a support person, not someone else to assist with the birth. 
How do I navigate this situation and make everyone happy? 

Any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks! 



 EDIT: thank you to everyone who gave me advice and shared their stories. All the comments have been really helpful. You all have really opened my eyes to this whole situation and given me a lot to think about. I really appreciate your insight. Thank you again! ","biraz bağlam için erkek arkadaşımla bir yıl üç aydır birlikteyiz, bana karşı nazik, iyi davranıyor ve her zaman benim için elinden geleni yapıyor, tek gerçek sorunum biraz ana kuzusu olması, yanlış anlamayın, annesiyle iyi bir ilişkim var ve annesi beni seviyor ve ilişkimizi onaylıyor, başlangıçta annesiyle olan yakınlığı beni rahatsız etmedi ve ona ne kadar değer verdiğini çok tatlı buldum, ancak çocuklar konusu açıldığında söylediklerinden rahatsız oldum

birkaç ay önce doğumhane durumunu konuştuk, hayır şu anda hamile değilim ama gelecekte o zaman geldiğinde ne yapacağımızı konuşuyorduk, annesinin her zaman kız arkadaşıyla veya karısıyla doğumhanede olmasını istediğini söyledi, ben de onun yanımda olmasını tercih ettiğimi söyledim, midesi bulandığını ve kan görmeye dayanamadığını, çıldıracağından korktuğunu söyledi, annemin doğumları sırasında her yeri örtmek için bir çarşaf kullanıldığını ve babamın sadece yüzünü ve karnının bir kısmını gördüğünü, buna rağmen kitaptaki her bahaneyi uydurmaya devam ettiğini belirttim

ben yapmayacağım yalan bu beni incitmişti partnerimin doğum odasında elimi tutup beni rahatlattığını hep hayal ettim eğer gerçekten orada olmak istemiyorsa annemin en iyi seçenek olacağını söyledim ve o da buna katılmadı annesinin çocukları olduğu ve görünüşe göre birçok kadının doğum yapmasına yardım ettiği için bana daha iyi yardım edebileceğini iddia etti ona annesinin özel yerlerimi görmesinden veya beni böyle savunmasız bir durumda görmesinden rahatsız olduğumu söyledim ama kültüründe kadınların birbirlerine doğum yapmada yardım etmesinin normal olduğunu iddia ediyor o meksikalıyım yarı beyaz yarı meksikalıyım ama temelde sadece beyazım lol

aslında sadece vücudum konusunda güvensiz olduğumu söyledi bu yüzden beni neredeyse çıplak görmesi beni rahatsız ediyor ancak tek sorun bu değil bir diğer endişem de doğum odasında bir kişiyi seçme şansım olsaydı ve onun annesini seçersem annemin güceneceğiydi sanki duygularımın bir önemi yokmuş gibi her zaman böyle olmasını istediğini söyledi çünkü doğum yapan ve travmatik bir şey yaşayan bendim bana tüm hayatım boyunca destek olan birinin orada olması gerektiğine inanıyorum hayat

tüm bunlara rağmen dik durdum ve ona eğer benimle orada olmak istemezsen annemin odada olacağını söyledim hikayenin sonu bu onu çok üzdü

nasıl hissettiğini anlıyorum ve tabii ki annesinin orada olmasına ve doğum yaptıktan sonra odaya gelmesine izin veriyorum sadece rahat edebileceğim birine ihtiyacım olduğunu hissediyorum odada olmaması konusunda uzlaşmaya hazırdım ama bu konuda uzlaşmam mümkün değil annesinin benim annemden daha fazla doğum yapmış olabileceğini biliyorum ama konu bu değil hemşireler ve doktorlar doğum yapmama yardım edecekler sadece bir destekçiye ihtiyacım var doğumda yardımcı olacak başka birine değil
bu durumla nasıl başa çıkabilirim ve herkesi mutlu edebilirim

herhangi bir tavsiye takdir edilecektir

teşekkürler

düzenleme bana tavsiye veren ve hikayelerini paylaşan herkese teşekkür ederim tüm yorumlar gerçekten yardımcı oldu hepiniz bu duruma gözlerimi açtınız ve düşünmem için bana çok şey verdiniz içgörünüze gerçekten minnettarım tekrar teşekkür ederim"
"
She's always like ""ohhh why I'm so short"", ""I'm so small I can't be seen!"", ""they'll think I'm in 10th grade still"" and some other weird comments. At first I thought it was just her ...sense of humor? That she just liked self-deprecating jokes? So I went along with it but she always made them. Every single day. So I started ignoring it completely and she still didn't stop. 

The only time I got close to telling her to stop was when I said ""get over your height"" and she said ""no no I love my height"" as if I thought she was insecure about it. 

It's so weird, how can I get her to stop it without hurting her feelings or making her mad?","o her zaman şöyle diyor: ""Neden bu kadar kısa boyluyum, çok küçüğüm, görünmüyorum, hala sınıfta olduğumu düşünecekler ve ilk başta bunun sadece mizah anlayışından kaynaklandığını, sadece kendini küçümseyen şakalardan hoşlandığını düşündüm, bu yüzden buna uydum ama her gün bunları yapıyordu, bu yüzden tamamen görmezden gelmeye başladım ve hala durmadı 

Ona durmasını söylemeye yaklaştığım tek zaman, boyunu aş dediğimdeydi ve hayır hayır, boyumu seviyorum, sanki bundan emin olmadığını düşünüyormuşum gibi dedi 

Çok garip, duygularını incitmeden veya onu kızdırmadan bunu nasıl durdurabilirim?"
"We're 16. We're virgins. We're still in school. We've been together about a year and a half. I have given him head before, but not actual vaginal sex. 

The only place we'd be able to do it is in the school where we'd have to be standing and it's where the door doesn't lock and we'd only have MAX 20 minutes. I'm worried that it would hurt for me and I don't really know how I could explain that to him. 

I am on the pill and he does have somewhere to get condoms if I say we can do it so we'd be protected, that's not the issue. I've told him before that in a bed or a car or on a couch or something I'd be good with it but not in the school since I think standing might hurt more and I'm afraid of, yknow, gravity on the potentials of blood and semen and whatever. I know the first time isn't  usually very good for women and I'm afraid even though I do love him and I do think about having sex a lot that actually doing it will maybe ruin my hopes for it.

I'm kind of thinking of doing it actually because it's been a while and I DO want to have sex, but I'd prefer it to be making love and not fucking. 

Anyone wanna tell me what I should do maybe? Or like what was your first time like? Maybe whether I should actually be worried at all?","bakireler hala okuldaydık birlikteydik yaklaşık bir buçuk yıldır ona oral seks yaptım ama gerçek vajinal seks yapmadım

bunu yapabileceğimiz tek yer okul olurdu, ayakta durmamız gereken ve kapının kilitlenmediği ve sadece en fazla dakikamızın olduğu yerdi bunun benim için acıtacağından endişeleniyorum ve bunu ona nasıl açıklayacağımı bilmiyorum

ben hap kullanıyorum ve prezervatif alabileceği bir yer var eğer bunu yapabileceğimizi söylersem korunacağız sorun bu değil ona daha önce yatakta, arabada, kanepede veya başka bir yerde bunu yapabileceğimi söylemiştim ama okulda değil çünkü ayakta durmanın daha fazla acıtacağını düşünüyorum ve kan ve meni potansiyelleri üzerindeki yer çekiminden korkuyorum ve her neyse biliyorum ilk sefer kadınlar için genellikle pek iyi olmuyor ve onu sevmeme ve seks yapmayı çok düşünmeme rağmen bunu gerçekten yapmanın umutlarımı mahvedeceğinden korkuyorum

aslında bunu yapmayı düşünüyorum çünkü uzun zaman oldu ve gerçekten istiyorum seks ama sevişmek olmasını tercih ederim ve sikişmemek

herhangi biri bana ne yapmam gerektiğini söylemek ister mi ya da ilk seferin neydi mesela belki de gerçekten endişelenmeli miyim"
"I've been really debating whether or not to share this with anyone because I'm afraid they'll think I'm crazy. But, here it goes.

I first met my boyfriend when I was 17 and now, at 22, we've been living together for a little over a year. Overall, our relationship is pretty alright. We have our disagreements from time to time, but nothing too serious that escalates into full blown arguments. The biggest blow up we had was when I was 19, which feels like ages ago now. Back then, he destroyed my sketchpads and diaries in a fit of anger. These days, if he's upset about something, he might take it out on my collection of vintage vinyl records. I know it might sound old fashioned to some people, but those records are like a little getaway for me. Occasionally things get physical between us too. Just a slap or a push. But apart from those moments of tension, we're pretty solid together. Honestly speaking, I truly love him.

A few months back during one of our movie nights with some drinks involved, he went to refill our glasses and disappeared for a short while. After finishing my drink though, an unusually overwhelming fatigue washed over me suddenly. More intense than usual. Unfortunately,I don't remember much after that point except waking up feeling achy and being told that I had passed out. I think maybe I had a bit too much to drink, but I usually handle my alcohol well, especially when it's just two glasses of wine.

The same thing happened again last week during dinner. It came on so suddenly and afterward, I felt incredibly sick for hours.

Then, just yesterday, we had a big argument where he threatened to break my favourite vintage record. Things got heated between us. We did raise our voices, but I don't like confrontation, so I quickly apologized and we moved past it. He handed me a glass of water while staring at me intensely as I drank. It was unsettling; his gaze seemed filled with pure disdain. I've never been looked at with such hatred before.

I'm not trying to be paranoid here. The idea that he could do something like that is horrifying, but I can't ignore the fear that is creeping up inside me. It's a new and scary feeling for me.","Bunu biriyle paylaşıp paylaşmama konusunda gerçekten kararsızdım çünkü beni deli sanacaklarından korkuyordum ama işte burada

Erkek arkadaşımla ilk tanıştığımda ben küçüktüm ve şimdi bir yıldan biraz fazla bir süredir birlikte yaşıyoruz, genel olarak ilişkimiz oldukça iyi, zaman zaman anlaşmazlıklarımız oluyor ama tam teşekküllü tartışmalara dönüşecek kadar ciddi bir şey değil, yaşadığımız en büyük anlaşmazlık ben küçükken oldu, şimdi sanki çok uzun zaman önceymiş gibi geliyor o zamanlar öfkeyle eskiz defterlerimi ve günlüklerimi yok etti, günümüzde bir şeye sinirlenirse eski plak koleksiyonumdan çıkarabilir, biliyorum bazı insanlara eski moda gelebilir ama o plaklar benim için küçük bir kaçamak gibi, bazen aramızda fiziksel şeyler de oluyor, sadece bir tokat veya bir itme ama o gerginlik anları dışında oldukça sağlamdık, dürüst olmak gerekirse onu gerçekten seviyorum

Birkaç ay önce, içki içtiğimiz bir film gecemizde bardaklarımızı doldurmaya gitti ve içkimi bitirdikten sonra kısa bir süre ortadan kayboldu, ancak alışılmadık derecede bunaltıcı bir yorgunluk aniden üzerime çöktü, her zamankinden daha yoğun, ne yazık ki ondan sonra pek bir şey hatırlamıyorum ağrılı bir şekilde uyanıp bayıldığımı söylemeleri dışında bir nokta var sanırım belki biraz fazla içmişimdir ama genelde alkolü iyi idare ederim özellikle de sadece iki kadeh şarap içtiğimde

aynı şey geçen hafta akşam yemeğinde de oldu, aniden geldi ve sonrasında saatlerce inanılmaz derecede hasta hissettim

sonra dün büyük bir tartışmamız oldu, en sevdiğim eski plakları kırmakla tehdit etti aramızda işler kızıştı sesimizi yükselttik ama ben yüzleşmeyi sevmem bu yüzden hemen özür diledim ve bunu atlattık bana bir bardak su uzattı ve ben içerken bana yoğun bir şekilde baktı, tedirgin ediciydi bakışları saf bir küçümsemeyle doluydu daha önce hiç bu kadar nefretle bakılmamıştım

burada paranoyak olmaya çalışmıyorum böyle bir şey yapabilmesi fikri korkunç ama içimde büyüyen korkuyu görmezden gelemiyorum bu benim için yeni ve korkutucu bir his"
"Let me start this with saying she was on the pill. I don't know if she wasn't taking it correctly or what. Regardless, here we are. 

I'm 29M and she's 25. We've been together 8 months. I have had a substance abuse issue since I was 19. Last year I went to rehab after almost losing my job and have really been trying to turn my life around. I'm struggling with my mental health but I'm in therapy and relieved to be clean.

Last week she told me she's pregnant. I immediately told her I can't handle the stress of taking care of a baby. I'm afraid it's going to make me relapse when I've finally been able to stay sober for almost ten months. Maybe I should have waited but I didn't want to lead her on in thinking that I was excited about it. We live in a state where abortion is legal and I told her if there are fees I will pay for them, I'll help take care of her and be there for her. When she reacted negatively to this I asked if she would be willing to find someone to adopt the baby but she was upset with me, told me I'm a monster and that she doesn't want to speak to me again. 

I feel terrible that she's so upset. But I can't risk my sobriety over a baby we would barely even be able to afford to take care of. We haven't talked since that initial conversation about it. I sent her a text telling her I know she needs space and that I'm sorry for hurting her and that I'll be here when she's ready to talk. I haven't heard back from her though. 

Did I fuck up? What could I have done differently?","buna hap kullandığını söyleyerek başlayayım, doğru kullanıp kullanmadığını bilmiyorum veya ne olursa olsun işte buradayız

geçen hafta bana hamile olduğunu söyledi, hemen ona bir bebekle ilgilenmenin stresini kaldıramayacağımı söyledim, sonunda neredeyse on ay boyunca ayık kalabildiğimde bunun beni tekrar kötüleştireceğinden korkuyorum, belki de beklemeliydim ama onu heyecanlandığımı düşünerek kandırmak istemedim, kürtajın yasal olduğu bir eyalette yaşıyoruz ve ona ücretler varsa ödeyeceğimi söyledim, ona bakmamda yardımcı olacağımı ve buna olumsuz tepki verdiğinde yanında olacağımı söyledim, bebeği evlat edinecek birini bulmaya istekli olup olmadığını sordum ama bana kızmıştı, bana canavar olduğumu ve benimle bir daha konuşmak istemediğini söyledi

"I (26m) discovered that my wife (25f) of less than a year cheated on me a few days ago. I've confronted her and she has admitted to it. She said it was a one time mistake, she doesn't know why she did it, she loves me and wishes she never did it. With a little pressing she said I don't pay her enough attention and I'm not very affectionate despite being married, even though I have never changed the way I am or acted in any way other than my normal self, which was good enough for the 7 years leading to marriage. I thought we were both secure, trusting, faithful adults who were understanding of eachother, our work, our children and our personal situations. I struggle with quite severe mental health conditions that I have worked so so hard to live as normally as possible with, and I am managing at a point where I almost feel normal. When I met her, I was living with the attitude that nothing matters and tried to end my life on multiple occasions. I abused drugs and alcohol, was in and out of hospital and had a vast team of health professionals who gave little hope. I was genuinely told 'people like (me) are usually in hospital, prison or a grave, so we're not sure what to suggest'. My wife was one of the life altering factors that brought me to a point of relative stability and normality, then in return, I was the safe place for her. I was her protector. I was her problem solver, her level headed and sensible place to turn. She was never any good at domestic life or finances, so I made sure we were always okay that way. In a crisis, she would always panic and I would always get us out of it and then panic later. We've been through so much together, with 2 beautiful children, 1 who has quite severe autism and the other with the most difficult attitude I've ever known. I thought we were a team, but I feel so betrayed. I never ever would have thought she'd do this, and I'm still in disbelief. I'm struggling to process my emotions and my thoughts are so unclear. I don't know how to even start in my head. I know I'm not going down any kind of spiral, yet at least, but I need to have some kind of mental conversation with myself otherwise I know I'm going to have a breakdown.
What do I do? I know that's not a question with any definite answer, but I can barely even think what I COULD do.

Before people asked we (me 22f) and him (21m) haved talked about it but it seems like he don’t care. Last time we had sex he made me feel gross he wasn’t paying attention to me and was just watching tv. He only likes penetration when I ride him. He tells me he can’t feel anything in any other position (idk if it’s because we use condoms) Even when I was riding him he payed no attention to me at all he was just watching tv and when I got off I had little discharge from a yest infection (he knew about it before we had sex and how I just got over it) and when I got off he made me feel gross. I haven’t even made him cum yet which bothers me a bit as I can turn him off but no matter how long I give him head or feed into his pleasure I can’t make him finish. The only time I made him finish is when I sent him nudes. I’m so close to just telling him I don’t want to try to have sex anymore and he can just sleep with someone else to get off. I don’t know what to do anymore so any advice helps at this point. What are some ways I can fix this problem?,İnsanlar sormadan önce ben ve o bunu konuştuk ama umursamıyor gibi görünüyor son seks yaptığımızda beni iğrenç hissettirdi bana dikkat etmiyordu sadece televizyon izliyordu sadece ona bindiğimde penetrasyondan hoşlanıyor bana başka hiçbir pozisyonda hiçbir şey hissedemediğini söylüyor prezervatif kullandığımız için mi bilmiyorum ona bindiğimde bile bana hiç dikkat etmiyordu sadece televizyon izliyordu ve indiğimde dünkü enfeksiyondan dolayı çok az akıntım vardı seks yapmadan önce bunu biliyordu ve nasıl atlattığımı ve indiğimde beni iğrenç hissettirdi henüz onu boşaltamadım bile bu beni biraz rahatsız ediyor çünkü onu kapatabiliyorum ama ona ne kadar uzun süre oral seks yaparsam yapayım veya zevkine ne kadar süre emersem emeyim onu ​​bitiremiyorum onu ​​bitirdiğim tek zaman ona çıplak fotoğraflar gönderdiğim zamandı ona artık seks yapmak istemediğimi ve boşalmak için başka biriyle yatabileceğini söylemeye çok yakınım artık ne yapacağımı bilmiyorum bu noktada her türlü tavsiye yardımcı olur bu sorunu çözmenin bazı yolları nelerdir
"Hey, we would like to get opinions on a topic from other people. We are not sure if what we are feeling with this is justified or not.

We bought a house 2 years ago. My wife was 5 months or so pregnant at the time. Her mom wanted to come help when the baby is born.

Her mom is retired. A few months before, she sold her house since she was mostly renting some place in Mexico and didn't want to keep up the house she owned. She brought up the idea of giving my wife the money from the house to avoid taxes on capital gains and so we could look for a house that would accommodate her to live with us and help with the baby. The rest of the purchase price would be our mortgage. The house is in our name only.

We agreed about that the money will be deducted from my wife’s inheritance. My wife and I also said her mom doesn’t have to pay rent in return of helping because we were overwhelmed with pregnancy, work, suddenly buying a house and the anxiety this all comes with. 

Two years in, we have a house with an in-law unit and her mom helps but we’re still in need of a babysitter. She isn’t paying any utilities or rent in that sense. The kid will go to pre school next summer and we will need a lot less help.

My wife’s and my feeling is that we should ask for rent. We don’t want to profit off her but we would ask to cover of her part of utilities and part of property taxes (since those are the running costs that are really high). We see it this way: My wife inherited money with warm hands and we bough a house with it. Her mom moved in to help and be with the kid. But she is here to stay and eventually, we will be taking care of her. Which is nice and fine. We just don't see why that would grant a rent free housing for the rest of her life.

But we are afraid that we could be very wrong with our feelings and making a mistake by just factoring in the money side of it. Hence this post. We would like to hear what other people think and are hoping to learn from other thoughts.

We brought it up the other day and her mom said she’s willing to share the utilities but not anything more.

By the way we are in good terms and her mom is great.","hey, bir konu hakkında diğer insanlardan görüş almak istiyoruz, bu konuda hissettiklerimizin haklı olup olmadığından emin değiliz

yıllar önce bir ev satın aldık, eşim hamile olduğu sırada birkaç ay kadar hamileydi, annesi bebeğin doğumunda yardım etmek istedi

annesi, çoğunlukla Meksika'da bir yer kiraladığı ve sahip olduğu evi elinde tutmak istemediği için evini satmadan birkaç ay önce emekli oldu, sermaye kazançları üzerindeki vergilerden kaçınmak için karıma evden para verme fikrini ortaya attı ve böylece bizimle yaşayabileceği ve bebeğe yardım edebileceği bir ev arayabilirdik, satın alma fiyatının geri kalanı ipotek olacak, ev sadece bizim adımıza olacak

paranın karımın mirasından düşüleceği konusunda anlaştık, karım ve ben ayrıca, hamilelik işleriyle boğuştuğumuz için annesinin yardım karşılığında kira ödemek zorunda olmadığını söyledik, aniden bir ev satın almak ve tüm bunların beraberinde getirdiği kaygı

iki yıl sonra, kayınvalidesi olan bir evimiz var ve annesi yardımcı oluyor ama hala bir bebek bakıcısı o herhangi bir kamu hizmeti veya kira ödemiyor bu anlamda çocuk gelecek yaz anaokuluna gidecek ve çok daha az yardıma ihtiyacımız olacak

benim ve karımın hissiyatı kira istememiz gerektiği yönünde, ondan kar etmek istemiyoruz ama kamu hizmetlerinin bir kısmını ve emlak vergilerinin bir kısmını karşılamayı isteriz çünkü bunlar gerçekten yüksek olan işletme maliyetleri, biz bunu bu şekilde görüyoruz karım sıcak ellerle miras kalan parayı ve onunla bir ev satın aldık annesi yardım etmek ve çocuğa bakmak için taşındı ama o burada kalacak ve sonunda ona bakacağız, bu güzel ve iyi sadece bunun hayatının geri kalanında kira ödemeden bir konut hakkı sağlayacağını anlayamıyoruz

ama duygularımızla çok yanılmış olabileceğimizden ve sadece para tarafını hesaba katarak hata yapabileceğimizden korkuyoruz bu yüzden bu gönderiyi diğer insanların ne düşündüğünü duymak istiyoruz ve diğer düşüncelerden ders çıkarmayı umuyoruz

geçen gün bunu gündeme getirdik ve annesi kamu hizmetlerini paylaşmaya istekli olduğunu ancak daha fazlasını istemediğini söyledi

bu arada aramız iyi ve annesi harika"
"My bf(21) suddenly died last week from drowning. Most of his family are back in Africa so I’m unsure if the family here wants to send the body back to Africa. We dated for 6 years. He died in another state so his body just came back to the town i live in and I (20) wants to go see it. My mom told me not to go because someone can happen to me and she doesn’t want to see me hurting. I explained to her I’m hurting either way and want to see it. I’m still in pain every day and can’t stomach anything. Idk if I will regret not going or going as I don’t know what I’m feeling rn.
Have you ever regretted not seeing someone for the last time even if it was just a body?

Update: I went to see him. He did look a bit different but he looked like him. He was very peaceful and I feel better about everything now. He was not prepared for viewing but he was covered from shoulder down with a cloth. I didn’t feel any specific emotions when I saw him, not sure if it’s gonna hit me later on but rn I feel good and don’t regret going. THANK YOU ALL. I really appreciate your input.","erkek arkadaşım geçen hafta aniden boğularak öldü ailesinin çoğu afrika'da bu yüzden buradaki ailenin cesedi afrika'ya geri göndermek isteyip istemediğinden emin değilim yıllarca çıktık başka bir eyalette öldü bu yüzden cesedi yaşadığım kasabaya geri döndü ve onu görmek istiyorum annem bana gitmememi söyledi çünkü birisi bana bir şey olabilir ve beni acı çekerken görmek istemiyor ona her iki şekilde de acı çektiğimi ve onu görmek istediğimi anlattım hala her gün acı çekiyorum ve hiçbir şeyi hazmedemiyorum gitmediğime pişman olur muyum bilmiyorum çünkü ne hissettiğimi bilmiyorum rn

"We always wanted a family &amp; I’ve been with him since I was 18 . We have been trying on/off for years &amp; suffered a couple losses in the process but last year we finally became a family when my son was born.

Unfortunately the hormones &amp; stuff brought out a lot of trauma in me that was buried &amp; it’s not been easy to navigate. I don’t think my mother wanted to be mom she didn’t watch me very well &amp; in return I ended up in scenarios that should t had from a very young age &amp; I now realize that’s why I have trouble coping in some areas of life. idk if that’s relevant or not it feels like it on some level cuz wtf.

Anyways I’ve been going through ppd/ppa I think &amp; def have been in a funk when my husband decided to order me some gifts (was a tea cabinet as I’ve taken up herbal tea) &amp; told me to not check online orders etc. I trust him so I didn’t. I was cleaning his computer room tho &amp; noticed a flash drive in his pc that didn’t look familiar at all. Later I was browsing on Amazon saw the flash drive in the order history the same time as my gift. So then I got suspicious like he was trying to hide it so I had to know now.

When I figured it out my world got flipped &amp; honestly it broke me. Was incest porn &amp; incest video games.

Is there any hope for him?

My head says no but my heart hurts so bad…","her zaman bir aile istedik ve ben onunla birlikteydim, yıllardır on-onunla uğraştık ve bu süreçte birkaç kayıp yaşadık ama geçen yıl oğlum doğduğunda sonunda bir aile olduk

"For some context, we’ve been together for almost 2 years now and we were both each others first time. We always go to his house to hang out, and he always wants to do it every time I come over. I don’t have an issue with it, but I’m not always in the mood to do so, but he usually persuades me into doing it. His parents work from home and I’m always really skiddy about not getting caught/making them feel like I don’t respect them, which doesn’t really allow me to enjoy it much at times because I want him to be done ASAP so we don’t get caught. His dad doesn’t care if the door is closed/almost shut, however his mom does.

So yesterday, we were both on his bed just relaxing and the door was basically almost shut and his mom knocked on the door to say hi to me and remind him to keep the door open. I didn’t really feel like doing it today beforehand either but his mom saying that just made me not want to do it more, because already talked to us about the door and she was doing a lot of movement up and down the stairs. He kept on getting upset that I didn’t want to do it today, but I stood my ground and just told him no, we can just do it tomorrow since I previously planned on coming over.

He kept on getting more annoyed and trying to turn me on I guess. I was asking him to please just relax because we will have another chance tomorrow and he was like I don’t want to wait because the last time we did it was tuesday. He kept on pressing the issue, and I just kept telling him to relax, and he turned away from me onto his stomach and I laid on top of him, and was rubbing my hands through his hair in attempt to make him feel better and then he just picked me up and flipped me onto his futon kind of hard.

 I was trying to not to cry because he freaked me out and I just begun to pack up my stuff to go, and then he started to hit his bed. And tried to hug me and apologize and said I shouldn’t come over anymore, because he only wants one thing when I come over, insinuating any time weren’t not doing anything sexual my time with him doesn’t matter, which really hurt. I just left his house, quick holding in the tears. I didn’t let him to walk me to the train station, but I was in full-blown tears on the subway. Now I’m wondering if he actually even loves me or if our whole relationship is just centered on him wanting to f*** me. He sent me multiple text messages, but I’m just not ready to talk to him yet. What should I do?

TDLR: My boyfriend wanted me to have sex with him but I wasn’t in the mood and rejected him. He then got really upset with me and said there’s no point to me coming over if we’re not doing anything, because he only wants one thing.","bağlam için yaklaşık yıllardır birlikteyiz ve ikimiz de birbirimizin ilk seferiydik, her zaman onun evine takılmaya giderdik ve her geldiğimde bunu yapmak isterdi, bununla ilgili bir sorunum yok ama her zaman bunu yapacak ruh halinde olmuyorum ama genellikle beni bunu yapmaya ikna ediyor, ailesi evden çalışıyor ve yakalanmamak konusunda her zaman çok çekingen davranıyorum, onlara saygı duymadığımı hissettiriyorum, bu da bazen bundan pek keyif almama izin vermiyor çünkü onun bir an önce işini bitirmesini istiyorum, böylece yakalanmayız, babası kapının kapalı olup olmadığını umursamıyor, neredeyse kapalı ama annesi umursuyor

gittikçe daha da sinirleniyordu ve beni tahrik etmeye çalışıyordu sanırım ona lütfen rahatlamasını söylüyordum çünkü yarın başka bir şansımız olacak ve o da beklemek istemiyorum çünkü en son salı günü gelmiştik dedi ve konuyu ısrarla açtı ve ben ona rahatlamasını söylemeye devam ettim ve benden uzaklaşıp karnına döndü ve ben de üstüne yattım ve ellerimi saçlarında gezdirerek daha iyi hissetmesini sağlamaya çalışıyordum ve sonra beni kucağına alıp sertçe futonuna yatırdı

ağlamamaya çalışıyordum çünkü beni korkutuyordu ve ben de eşyalarımı toplamaya başladım ve sonra yatağına yatmaya başladı ve bana sarılıp özür dilemeye çalıştı ve artık gelmemem gerektiğini söyledi çünkü geldiğimde tek bir şey istiyormuş gibi imada bulundu cinsel bir şey yapmayacağımı ima etti onunla geçirdiğim zamanın önemi yoktu ve bu gerçekten canımı yaktı az önce evinden çıktım gözyaşlarımı tutarak beni tren istasyonuna kadar götürmesine izin vermedim ama şimdi metroda tam anlamıyla gözyaşları içindeydim gerçekten beni sevip sevmediğini veya tüm ilişkimizin sadece beni becermek istemesi üzerine mi kurulu olduğunu merak ediyorum bana birden fazla mesaj attı ama henüz onunla konuşmaya hazır değilim ne yapmalıyım

"I (M41) have been married to my wife (f32) for 8 years. Recently, she took a trip to see my brother without me to help him with some of his rental properties and get some insurance claims completed. I stayed back home (3 states away) and took care of our pets.
Since she came back (month ago), she’s been acting strange. Distant, constantly on her phone and different/distracted. Against my better judgement, I went through her phone while she was asleep last night. 
They had been sending flirty messages for the past month and then a full sexting session with pictures/videos.
I haven’t slept. I confronted her about it this morning. She confessed everything. Claims nothing while she was there just the texting when she got back.

"So I met this guy on Tindr, we were talking on there for a while, then we moved it to Snapchat. He had asked me to come over his house towards the beginning of talking, but I had declined. I told him I wanted to meet somewhere more public first, which he said he respected. Anyways, we talked a lot, and had good conversation. He asked to meet up with me tonight, which I agreed on. Where I live, everything is closed around 9. I told him we could meet at McDonald's, and I could drive us to the beach (there's a lot of people at the beach at night), or we could meet there. He told me he wanted to pick me up in his car, and drive me to the beach. I told him I don't feel comfortable with that (tmi, but a man attempted to SA me on a date before, so I'm cautious). I told him I didn't feel comfortable with that, as I've been in negative situations before.

Lately, whenever we get intimate, he tends to rush things. I’ve noticed that he’ll try to initiate penetration even when I’m not fully aroused or ready. I don’t know if he’s just caught up in the moment or not paying attention, but it’s uncomfortable, and sometimes even painful. I’ve tried subtly hinting that I need more time or foreplay, but he doesn’t seem to get the message, or if he does, he doesn’t adjust.

I don’t want to hurt his feelings or make him feel like he’s doing something wrong, but it’s affecting my enjoyment of being intimate with him. I feel like I’m constantly tense, worried that things will move too fast before my body is ready. It’s reached a point where I sometimes dread sex, which is the last thing I want because I do love him and want to share that connection with him.

I’ve thought about sitting him down and talking directly about it, but I’m afraid he’ll take it personally or get defensive. He’s a pretty sensitive guy, and I don’t want this to become a bigger issue. How do I approach this conversation in a way that’s honest but also kind? Has anyone else been in this situation before, and how did you handle it?

I just want things to improve without making him feel bad or ruining what we have. Any advice would be really appreciated.

Thanks in advance!","herkese merhaba

buna nasıl yaklaşacağımı bilmiyorum bu yüzden ilişkimde beni rahatsız eden bir şey hakkında biraz tavsiye veya bakış açısı almayı umuyorum erkek arkadaşımla yaklaşık bir yıldır birlikteyiz ve aramızdaki her şey çoğunlukla harika gidiyor o biraz komik ve çoğu alanda gerçekten iyi anlaşıyoruz ama konu seks olduğunda ele almakta zorlandığım bir sorun var

son zamanlarda ne zaman yakınlaşsak acele etme eğiliminde oluyor bunu fark ettim ki tam olarak uyarılmamış veya hazır olmasam bile penetrasyonu başlatmaya çalışıyor sadece anın büyüsüne mi kapıldı yoksa dikkat etmiyor mu bilmiyorum ama rahatsız edici ve hatta bazen acı verici daha fazla zamana veya ön sevişmeye ihtiyacım olduğunu ima etmeye çalıştım ama mesajı almıyor gibi görünüyor veya anlasa bile uyum sağlamıyor

duygularını incitmek veya yanlış bir şey yaptığını hissettirmek istemiyorum ama bu onunla yakın olmaktan aldığım keyfi etkiliyor sürekli gergin hissediyorum vücudum hazır olmadan her şeyin çok hızlı hareket edeceğinden endişeleniyorum bazen seksten korktuğum bir noktaya geldim ki bu istediğim son şey çünkü seviyorum onunla ve bu bağlantıyı onunla paylaşmak istiyorum

Onu oturtup doğrudan konuşmayı düşündüm ama kişisel algılamasından veya savunmaya geçmesinden korkuyorum. Oldukça hassas bir adam ve bunun daha büyük bir sorun olmasını istemiyorum. Bu konuşmaya dürüst ama aynı zamanda nazik bir şekilde nasıl yaklaşabilirim? Daha önce başka biri bu durumda oldu mu ve siz nasıl başa çıktınız?

Sadece onu kötü hissettirmeden veya sahip olduklarımızı mahvetmeden işlerin düzelmesini istiyorum. Herhangi bir tavsiyeniz gerçekten takdir edilecektir.

Şimdiden teşekkürler"
"We’ve been together for three years, and while our relationship is generally good, there have been some red flags recently. A few months ago, I noticed some of my personal items were moved around or missing, but she brushed it off as accidents.

A couple of weeks ago, she became oddly defensive when I asked about a late-night phone call she took in private. And just yesterday, I found a hidden drawer in our apartment with some of my things I thought were lost, but she said she was “organizing.”

I don’t want to accuse her of anything without solid proof, but I’m feeling uneasy and unsure.

Edit: Thanks for the input. I’ll take everything into consideration and figure out what to do next.","üç yıldır birlikteyiz ve ilişkimiz genel olarak iyi olsa da son zamanlarda bazı kırmızı bayraklar vardı birkaç ay önce kişisel eşyalarımdan bazılarının yer değiştirdiğini veya kaybolduğunu fark ettim ama o bunu kaza olarak geçiştirdi

"I'm (F) in college and left home a year ago. My parents are in their early 70s. They're both very fit for their age, and everyone I know who has learned of their age has always said that they look to be in their mid 50s. Both of them are financially well off enough, they were decent parents in raising me, and they haven't had any serious health issues that I know of.

They just told me that they are looking into adopting a two year old baby. I'm in shock. Despite all of the positive aspects of this and all the good that may come out of it, I just can't get over their age. They will be in their 90s when the child goes to college, if all goes well. I can't help but feel that this is selfish of them, and I'm scared to think of what will happen if something goes wrong in the next 16 years, and I inevitably have to take custody of the child. I don't think they can afford to hire help, and I don't think they would to begin with, so I don't believe they plan to raise the child with the hired assistance. They are not people who do things without thoroughly thinking them through, so I can't imagine what is going through their heads. I haven't said anything yet, I only nodded and asked to speak later. I don't know if there is anything I should say. I'm at a loss for words, please advise.

**Edit:** This is getting a lot more attention than I expected, thank you to everyone who provided some advice. I'm going to log out of this account as I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by the situation, but I'll report back once I know definitively what will happen. I do want to make clear that I'm more confused than angry or upset. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why they are trying to do this now, and I really wish it were April 1st today.","üniversitede okuyorum ve bir yıl önce evden ayrıldım. ebeveynlerim erken yaşta. ikisi de yaşlarına göre çok formdalar ve yaşlarını öğrenen tanıdığım herkes her zaman orta yaşlarda göründüklerini söyledi. ikisi de maddi olarak yeterince iyi durumda. beni yetiştirirken iyi ebeveynlerdi ve bildiğim kadarıyla ciddi bir sağlık sorunları olmadı.

"I didn't think much about my yearbook quote and just put what I was listening to at the moment, which happened to be 'Nur Jedem das Seine' by Bach. However, a couple hours ago I got a call from a woman from my school accusing me of being a nazi, racist etc. When I ask why she tells me the quote (which as far as I was aware is just a phrase and song title) is some nazi or communist slogan and she'll be alerting the college I'm committed to and pursue disciplinary action.

"Updated!

Don't worry if the title confuses You, you aren't the only one confused here.

Anyway I (28m) used to be in a serious relationship with my ex gf Emma (27f) about four years ago. Official for two years friends for three. And around the time of our breakup I was actually thinking about asking her to move in together. That all came crashing down when she invited me over one night. I went over thinking she wanted to watch something on the t.v. and do some ""cuddling"".

However when I got there she dropped a bomb on me. She was having an emotional affair with her coworker Sarah (25f). Yes she's bi and yes I had known since we were friends. That's actually what attracted her to me tbh, the fact I was the first guy to know she was bi and not immediately ask for a F/F/M cuddling session.

Anyway, she told me she didn't mean for it to happen and she didn't even know it was an emotional affair until the coworker asked her out on an official date after they finished having a work lunch together.(unless she and the coworker lied to me, the coworker didn't know she was with someone, more on this later.)

Anyway after that she thought back on everything realized it was an e.m. And immediately called me over as she knew I didn't deserve that, her words. Obviously I was crushed and, not ashamed to admit, I cried she also cried and apologized a bunch. We then spent the next hour talking about how we were gonna split because cheating is an instant deal breaker with me and she knew that.

Anyway we discussed what we were gonna tell our friends as we were apart of the same group. I was fine with telling them we broke up after drifted apart but she was adamant about telling them the truth. Once we got all that sorted and I got my stuff I left but before I did she told me she knew it was wrong but she wanted to see where it went this Sarah.

It kinda felt like she was asking for permission so I told her she was free to do as she wanted but I would probably keep my distance from that.

The next year I still hung out with the friend group but they only invited me out when Emma and Sarah weren't there and vise versa. They also didn't tell me updates about them, my request, so the only thing I knew was that they were dating and she was bringing her around the group.

After about a year, I decided it was time to get over it and I started slowly by asking them about updates in her life. She and Sarah were living together already and were pretty serious. I then told the group next time they seen them to let them know that I was okay doing things with them and the friend group if they were comfortable with it.

A few days later I got the okay from the friend group and that next weekend I seen my ex for the first time in a year as well as her partner. Honestly, this girl seems like the female version of me. We have the same intrests, same hobbies, even the same dirty minded humor. But I might be reading into that too much.

The first thing Sarah did was apologise multiple times during the night. And it did sound genuine so that's why I don't think my ex was lying a year ago. Anyway the night went by fine and the next three years everything was good. Sarah and Emma actually got married about a year and half ago.

I didn't go but I let them know I wished them happiness and joy and they said they appreciated it.

Anyway, over the last couple months we haven't really gotten the chance to hang out at all. It's either work life or home life with most of the friend group, myself included.

Anyway I was at the grocery store earlier today and was walking up and down the isles when I seen Sarah coming towards me. I smiled and waved and now that I look back on it, She didn't really smile too happily and looked nervous even.

We got to each other and I said it was good to see her and was about to make small talk when she spoke.

""Just so you know I'm not some s\*x freak who goes around breaking up relationships and then sleeping with both people. I just thought you could help us out and I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable"" she said it in kind of an ashamed voice. I just said ""good to know"" since I was confused as Hell and didn't really know what to say. She looked at me for a few seconds before asking when the last time I had spoken to my ex was. So I answered honestly which was 3 or 3 and a half months.

She asked if I could prove that. I was now very confused but I pulled out my phone and showed her my text chain with my ex and even my call log since I don't call people too much. After she seen them she turned around and walked off without another word and without her grocery cart, even when I called after her she ignored me and kept walking until she turned the corner of the isle.

I was confused but shrugged it off and went about my day.

Later that night I was watching tv in my house when my phone began ringing. I seen it was my ex calling which was weird as she only even called me now when it was an emergency, she usually texts. Last time she called me, a member of our friend group was in a accident and we weren't sure he was gonna make it(he did.)

So I immediately answered and barely got the hel of 'hello' out before I was met with demonic screaming that made me pull the phone away from my ear otherwise I thought I was gonna go deaf.

I kept trying for a minute to speak through the screaming before I decided to hang up. That's when the texts started coming in.

I'm not gonna repeat what she called me and said, but let's just say, I'm half Irish and half Scottish and she made me say 'wow'

I was dealing with that when my doorbell rang. I left my phone on the coffee table and answered the door to see Sarah standing there with red eyes and a packed bag.

She asked me if she could spend a night or two here.

Over the three years I had interacted with her, I knew she had moved here from a different part of the country for work and didn't have any family here and out our friend group I'm one of three I think with space to house a guest since most of our friend group either lived in small apartments or had family's and small children.

So I invited her in and either she seen my phone going off like crazy or it was that six sense that women posses lol.

Anyway she said she'd explain later but for now she needed to relax and think. So I let her have the guest bedroom and left her alone for the night. Only asking if she wanted any take out or anything as I wasn't expecting to entertain guests and I was just gonna order out originally. She didn't want anything.

Now I'm sitting here in my bed with my back against the wall listening to her cry, as my room and the guest room share a wall, while I'm also getting some texts from a few of the friend group about me minding my own business and such.

So was it wrong of me for telling my ex's wife when the last time I contacted her was? And if not, does anyone have any idea what the hell I set off

Update 19/03/24

Sorry for the delay guys, I wrote this right before bed and when I woke up I didn't have time to check this account before I had to deal with everything. Plus with work and all that, I don't really have time to come on here much but I did check out most of the comments.

So I called in to work the next day and made breakfast and then called out Sarah telling her it was made. About 5 minutes later, she came out and she looked like sh\*t. Her hair was messy and her eyes were bloodshot, it looked like she had been crying all night.

We ate in silence as I didn't really want to ask her about it and wanted her to be the one to bring it up. And she did once we were done eating. So to any of you who commented and said it was about kids, winner winner chicken dinner.

At the beginning of this year, Sarah and Emma began talking about having kids. However they didn't want, or have the money, to do it the medical way and didn't feel using a total stranger off tinder or something as their donor. So that left our friend group and other friends that weren't in the group. I'll give you a guess on who was one of the top picks. I don't have any major medical history, I'm tall (which is something I guess they want?) And I work out pretty frequently so I'm in good shape. And I'm not married and single.

Another thing is, from a young age my ex knew she probably wouldn't be able to have kids. Her high school boyfriend got her pregnant and took off towards the end of school. She wasn't going to college so she decided to keep the baby. However at some point she had a miscarriage. A bad one. I don't know all the details but she almost didn't survive and after that was told that she could conceive but there was only about a 20 percent chance she would carry the baby the full nine months and even then there's also the birth so that meant that Sarah would be the one 'getting the donation'.

Anyway my ex said that she would talk to me and see if I was okay with doing it. I guess they also wanted to spice up their bedroom life so this was kind of 'a two birds one stone' situation.

A few days after that, Sarah came home from running errands and found Emma crying. She said that I had called her about something unrelated and she took that chance to tell me about what the two had been wanting. Apparently I thought it was disgusting that they brought this to me and said that Sarah probably knew Emma was in a relationship all those years ago and she probably did stuff like this before ( I guess breaking up couples and sleeping with both people)

I even threatened to leave the friend group over it but Emma convinced me not to and I agreed on the condition that this never be brought up again. And I guess that would've worked if we had hung out since 'our conversation'. If we had I don't think I'd be here writing about this since Emma would've been at Sarah's side to remind her not to talk to me about it. But she had ran into me by herself at the grocery store and felt that she needed to at least apologize since it was her idea to add me as a potential donor.

After she left the store, I guess she went straight home and waited for Emma to get back from whatever she was doing, which is why there was a time gap between the store and the phone call. Anyway I guess the two got into it and it eventually came out that Emma was the one who thought it was weird that Sarah wanted me to be a donor. I think for Sarah it was more the lying to her for months about this and I guess a lot of the other potential donors already said no so I was one of the last chances for them to have a kid right now. She didn't go into detail but I guess some more things were said and names were called and all that and Sarah packed a bag and left their place. You all know the story from there.

Anyway I remembered some comments from the original post and told her it probably wasn't a good idea to be staying with me and she agreed. I guess last night Emma was texting her multiple times and one of the last ones was ""just let me know where you are so I know your safe'' and when she had 'op's house' written out she immediately knew that would cause more problems so she just wrote back the name of a hotel.

Anyway that's where she's staying since she left a few hours ago and the texts and calls from the friends and Emma had stopped so I'm guessing Sarah got a hold of them. Also I probably wasn't clear last time. It wasn't the whole friend group texting me, it was more of the hardcore Emma friends that she's known since childhood. I came into this group after one of my friends starting dating a girl from it and invited me to a few of their get togethers and I stayed even after my friend and the girl broke up since I got along with them pretty good and also because of Emma.

Also guys, believe me I tried asking them what it was about and saying I didn't know what was going on but they were spamming me, so my texts were either ignored or missed by them. So after a while I just said fuk it and turned my phone off.

So anyway that's the update. I probably won't post again unless something major happens.","updated

neyse, orijinal gönderideki bazı yorumları hatırladım ve ona benimle kalmasının muhtemelen iyi bir fikir olmadığını söyledim ve o da kabul etti sanırım dün gece emma ona birkaç kez mesaj atmıştı ve sonunculardan biri sadece nerede olduğunu bana bildir ki güvende olduğunu bileyim ve operasyon evi yazıldığında bunun daha fazla soruna yol açacağını hemen anladı bu yüzden sadece bir otelin adını yazdı

neyse, birkaç saat önce ayrıldığı için kaldığı yer burası ve arkadaşlarından ve emma'dan gelen mesajlar ve aramalar durmuştu bu yüzden sarah'nın onlara ulaştığını tahmin ediyorum ayrıca muhtemelen geçen sefer net değildim bana mesaj atan tüm arkadaş grubu değildi daha çok çocukluğundan beri tanıdığı hardcore emma arkadaşlarıydı bu gruba arkadaşlarımdan biri bir kızla çıkmaya başladıktan sonra katıldım ve beni birkaç buluşmalarına davet ettiler ve arkadaşımla kız ayrıldıktan sonra bile kaldım çünkü onlarla oldukça iyi anlaşıyordum ve ayrıca emma yüzünden

ayrıca beyler inanın bana onlara ne hakkında olduğunu sormaya çalıştım ve ne olup bittiğini bilmediğimi söyledim ama bana spam gönderiyorlardı bu yüzden mesajlarım ya görmezden gelindi ya da onlar tarafından kaçırıldı bu yüzden bir süre sonra sadece siktir et dedim ve telefonumu kapattım

neyse bu güncelleme, büyük bir şey olmadığı sürece muhtemelen bir daha mesaj atmayacağım"
